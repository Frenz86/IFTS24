is our forecast traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. especially if you have to prepare a presentation. i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. as far as the business meetings, i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. my suggestion for where to go is austin. play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski\\'s. flying somewhere takes too much time. test

allen/hou/ect@ect cc: beth perlman/hou/ect@ect subject: consolidated positions: issues & to do list phillip, below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allan\\'s list; the need for a single set of requirements. although the meeting with keith, on wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. throughout the meeting on wednesday, keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like excel). what needs to happen on monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project. i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. i believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve. richard ---------------------- forwarded by richard burchfield/hou/ect on 10/06/2000 08:34 am

subject: consolidated positions: issues & to do list from our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, i think we still have the following issues: we don\\'t have a single point of contact from the trading group. we\\'ve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders. we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. we\\'re getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation. things left to do: i think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we\\'re trying to accomplish with this project. it\\'ll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope. for those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs. use the above to formulate a project plan. things requested thus far (no particular order): inclusion of sitara physical deals into the tds position manager and deal ticker. customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns). new drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ... addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position. ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions. each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each: gas daily for monthly index, physical gas for nymex, physical gas for inside ferc, physical gas for mid market. ability for tds to pull valuation results based on a tds flag instead of using official valuations. position and p&l aggregation across all gas desks. ability to include the gas price book into tds: inclusion of spread options in our systems. ability to handle volatility skew and correlations. ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day. approximate delta changes between valuations

issues & to do list phillip, below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allan\\'s list; the need for a single set of requirements. although the meeting with keith, on wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. throughout the meeting on wednesday, keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like excel). what needs to happen on monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project. i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. i believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

peggy alix/hou/ect@ect, russ severson/hou/ect@ect, scott mills/hou/ect@ect, kenny ha/hou/ect@ect subject: consolidated positions: issues & to do list from our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions, i think we still have the following issues: we don\\'t have a single point of contact from the trading group. we\\'ve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders. we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. we\\'re getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation. things left to do: i think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we\\'re trying to accomplish with this project. it\\'ll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope. for those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs. use the above to formulate a project plan. things requested thus far (no particular order): inclusion of sitara physical deals into the tds position manager and deal ticker. customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns). new drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ... addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position. ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions. each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each: gas daily for monthly index, physical gas for nymex, physical gas for inside ferc, physical gas for mid market. ability for tds to pull valuation results based on a tds flag instead of using official valuations. position and p&l aggregation across all gas desks. ability to include the gas price book into tds: inclusion of spread options in our systems. ability to handle volatility skew and correlations. ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day. approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid. valuation of gas daily options. a new position screen for options (months x strike x delta). tbd. inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.

information requirements, let me know. then, let me know your interest level in the westgate project? san marcos the property across the street from the sagewood units in san marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. the land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in west san marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. this property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now. if this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity. the equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. i will know more on this question later today. sincerely, george w. richards president, creekside builders, llc - winmail.dat ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k

san juan monthly index. it appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for san juan gas. at the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan. we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27. these are the complete list of trades from enron online (eol), enron\\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (amerex, apb, and prebon). please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships. the two key points from this data are as follows: 1. the high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. the spread relationship between san juan and other points (socal & northwest) is consistent between the end of september and october gas daily. it doesn\\'t make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70\\'s and these trades are outliers. i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. it is enron\\'s belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business. please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal.

typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or llc) general partner. the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. land ownership & loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits is reduced. all loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc. these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. early land costs the $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\". this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa. this release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. as such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. the lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. this would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. phasing works as follows. if the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. this would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. construction loans there are three types of construction loans. first, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. second, is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will be from 80% to 95% of value. disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. these fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. finally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. at present cb does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. what did you have in mind? i would like to use some form of

to give you an update. i have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12. kipp flores is working on the construction drawings. at the same time i am pursuing fha financing. once the construction drawings are complete i will send them to you for a revised bid. your original bid was competitive and i am still attracted to your firm because of your

to mike grigsby at 37031 so he can pass it along to the user at gas daily today. i will be out of the office on friday. thank you phillip john, denver\\'s short rockies position beyond 2002 is created by their trailblazer transport. they are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and 2005. they are scrubbing all their books and booking the hubert deal on wednesday and thursday. phillip jim, is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing california this week? can you make sure the gas desk is included. phillip george, below is a list of questions that keith and i had regarding the westgate project: ownership structure what will be the ownership structure? limited partnership? general partner? what are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and liabilities)? who owns the land? improvements? who holds the various loans? is the land collateral? investment what happens to initial investment? is it used to purchase land for cash?secure future loans? why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? when is the 700,000 actually needed? now or for the land closing? investment schedule? investment return is equity repayment the return of the original investment? is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? debt which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan? improvement construction are these the only two loans? looks like it from the cash flow statement. terms of each loan? uses of funds how will disbursements be made? by whom? what type of bank account? controls on max disbursement? internet viewing for investors? reports to track expenses vs plan? bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? what is the relationship of creekside builders to the project? do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits? do you or larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? design and construction when will design be complete? what input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? what level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? does creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? names? these questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me. also, i want to learn as much as possible from the process. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 09/19/2000 04:35 pm --------------------------- \"george richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/08/2000 05:21:49 am please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> to: \"phillip allen\" <pallen@enron.com> cc: \"larry lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> subject: westgate proforma-phillip allen.xls enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the westgate property is austin that we told you about. as you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. this is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the austin market. the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. as it is in the \"smart growth corridor\" area designated by the city of austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. i have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in north austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, i used this data to be cautious. the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at st. edwards university. as with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. we have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on westgate and cameron loop. gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. this will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an a&d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. this analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. as we discussed in san marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. i believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. you would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. larry lewter knows an expert in the field in san antonio if you do not know anyone. i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by airborne express today for saturday delivery. once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. my cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. i look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. i regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. a small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes. one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. the city shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. then last week i had to take my wife to emergency. she has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. george w. richards creekside builders, llc - westgate proforma-phillip allen.xls george, here sales numbers from reagan: as you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot. the 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling. at 2.7 mm, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units under construction. i am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way. the price i am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date. let me know what you think. i will follow up with an email and phone call about cherry creek. i am sure deborah yates let you know that the bid was rejected on the de ville property. phillip allen jeff, what is up with burnet? phillip jeff, i need to see the site plan for burnet. remember i must get written approval from brenda key stone before i can sell this property and she has concerns about the way the property will be subdivided. i would also like to review the closing statements as soon as possible. phillip lucy, i want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. i faxed you a copy of this file. you can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct amounts and i will input. brenda, i checked my records and i mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on august 28th. i mailed it to 4303 pate rd. #29, college station, tx 77845. i will go ahead and mail you another check. if the first one shows up you can treat the 2nd as payment for october. i know your concerns about the site plan. i will not proceed without getting the details and getting your approval. i will find that amortization schedule and send it soon. phillip lucy, you wrote fewer checks this month. spent more money on materials and less on labor. june july

will drive by friday evening. i will let you know next week if i need to see the inside. can you find out when chelsea villa last changed hands and for what price? what about getting a look at the site plans for the burnet deal. remember we have to get brenda happy. phillip 9/8 9/7 diff socal 36,600 37,200 -600 nwpl -51,000 -51,250 250 san juan -32,500 -32,000 -500 the reason the benchmark report shows net selling san juan is that the transport positions were rolled in on 9/8. this added 800 shorts to san juan and 200 longs to socal. before this adjustment we bought 300 san juan and sold 800 socal. why is aeco basis so low on the list? is nwpl mapped differently than aeco? what about the correlation to nymex on aeco? jeff, you would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. i am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which i might become involved with creekside. are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts? is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue? did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch? i am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet. phillip

lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot duplex project, was selling his units in the $180\\'s, he does have a much lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units. we do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. this would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. (i thought his sales price was $187,000.) at this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. what is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability. you have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation. as for rent-ability, i believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. in fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. phillip, i will call you today to go over this more thoroughly. sincerely, george w. richards

we can close into an a&d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. this analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. as we discussed in san marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. i believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. you would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. larry lewter knows an expert in the field in san antonio if you do not know anyone. i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by airborne express today for saturday delivery. once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. my cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. i look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. i regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. a small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes. one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. the city shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. then last week i had to take my wife to emergency. she has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. george w. richards creekside builders, llc - westgate proforma-phillip allen.xls ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 09/06/2000 03:53 pm

sold for around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex). i spoke to reagan and he indicated that he had more units under construction that would be available in the 180\\'s. are the units he is selling significantly different from yours? he mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor plan. my bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex. as far as being an investor in a new project, i am still very interested. call or email with

11:41 am to: john d suarez/hou/ect@ect, suresh vasan/enron communications@enron communications@enron cc: subject: internet data gain is a major power drain on local utilities ( september 05, 2000 ) in 1997, a little-known silicon valley company called exodus communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in tukwila. the mission was to handle the internet traffic and computer servers for the region\\'s growing number of dot-coms. fast-forward to summer 2000. exodus is now wrapping up construction on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its original facility. sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually house internet servers for firms such as avenue a, microsoft and onvia.com. exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near seattle. more than a dozen companies -- with names like abovenet, globix and hostpro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking equipment of the internet economy. it is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite web sites. data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are sprouting at such a furious pace in tukwila and the kent valley that some have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and puget sound energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security facilities. \"we are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445 megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall,\" said karl karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for puget sound energy. \"that is the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads. puget sound energy last week asked the washington utilities and transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. the tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects. those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each, karzmar said. not to be left behind, seattle city light plans to bring up the data center issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting. for the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the region, this is a new and complex issue. on one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power -- represent potentially lucrative business customers. the facilities run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue stream. on the other hand, they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures. who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates in the area is still open to debate. \"these facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,\" said bob royer, director of communications and public affairs at seattle city light. \"the entire university of washington, from stadium lights at the football game to the medical school, averages 31 megawatts per day. we have data center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.\" with more than 1.5 million square feet, the intergate complex in tukwila is one of the biggest data centers. sabey corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million square-foot intergate east facility last september from boeing space & defense. in less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the six-building complex to seven different co-location companies. \"it is probably the largest data center park in the country,\" boasts laurent poole, chief operating officer at sabey. exodus, icg communications, netstream communications, pac west telecomm and zama networks all lease space in the office park. after building exodus\\' first tukwila facility in 1997, sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in los angeles, spokane and denver. poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of internet data centers in the country. as more people access the internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks such as listening to online music, poole said the need for co-location space in seattle continues to escalate. but it is not just seattle. the need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as texas and california. exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. while companies such as amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as exodus that may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic management. \"we have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now than data center space,\" said steve porter, an account executive at exodus in seattle. the booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility industry perplexed. \"it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,\" said seattle city light\\'s royer. \"the utility industry is almost stunned by this, in a way.\" ina, can you pull tori k.\\'s and martin cuilla\\'s resumes and past performance reviews from h.r. ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k

what do i need to provide besides headcount? otherwise any afternoon next week would be fine phillip colleen, please add mike grigsby to the distribution. on another note, do you have any idea how patti is holding up? phillip brad, with regard to tori kuykendall, i would like to promote her to commercial manager instead of converting her from a commercial support manager to an associate. her duties since the beginning of the year have been those of a commercial manager. i have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end. martin cuilla on the central desk is in a similiar situation as tori. hunter would like martin handled the same as tori. let me know if there are any issues. phillip bruce, can you stop by and set up my reuters. phillip lucy, the rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better. see if you can add these modifications: 1. use a formula in column e. add the value in column c to column d. it should read =c6+d6. then copy this formula to the rows below. 2. column h needs a formula. subtract amount paid from amount owed. =e6-g6. 3. column f is filled with the #### sign. this is because the column width is too narrow. use you mouse to click on the line beside the letter f. hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider. 4. after we get the rent part fixed, lets bring the database columns up to this sheet and place them to the right in columns j and beyond. phillip lucy, i got your email with the attachment. let\\'s work together today to get this done phillip you have my approval lucy, we can discuss your email later. how is progress on creating the spreadsheets. you will probably need to close the file before you attach to an email. it is 2:00. i really want to make some progress on these two files. phillip lucy, please open this excel file and input the rents and names due for this week. then email the file back. open the \"utility\" spreadsheet and try to complete the analysis of whether it is better to be a small commercial or a medium commercial (lp-1). you will need to get the usage for that meter for the last 12 months. if we have one year of data, we can tell which will be cheaper. use the rates described in the spreadsheet. this is a great chance for you to practice excel. ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 04/30/2001 11:21 am --------------------------- alan comnes 04/27/2001 01:38 pm to: phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: joe hartsoe/corp/enron@enron subject: request from steve kean phillip, i got this request. on the gas side, i think kean/lay need an update to a table you prepared for me a few months ago, which i\\'ve attached.. can you oblige?

mac, thanks for the research report on eog. here are my observations: gas sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year estimated gas prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. recalc of eps with more accurate gas prices: (334,340,000 mct x $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional eps x 12 p/e multiple = $34 a share that is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices. i think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share. current price 37 nat. gas 34 crude 10 total 81 can you take a look at these numbers and play devil\\'s advocate?

to a friend that works for the new company. i think i know the answer to your questions but i want to get the exact details from him. basically, they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider. then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. the risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk. this is my best guess. i will get back to you with more. phillip lucy, i want to speak to wade myself. he can call me at work or home. or if you email me his number i will call him. i would like gary to direct wade on renovation tasks and you can give him work orders for normal maintenance. i will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office. do you need mary to come in on any more fridays? i think i can guess your answer. i might stop by this friday. phillip nan ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 06/12/2000 10:55

generation by unit. the wscc data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until july 1999, and the cemms, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. for your purposes the caiso may suffice. i think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" generation. you are pulling \"scheduled.\" if someone doesn\\'t schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that. you may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. that is, if they have 1500 mw of load and 1200 mw of generation, they may simply schedule 300 mw of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 mw. having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side. on the load side i think that i would simply use caiso actual load. while they don\\'t split out np15 from sp15, i think that using the actual number is better than the \"scheduled\" number. the utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price. i think the presentation looks good. it would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished. i\\'d like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional gw of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption. i was surprised by how small the ueg consumption was compared to other uses. if it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story. let\\'s talk. check out np gen & load.

(if the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l.) maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that i am not seeing, but anyway, here are the deal #\\'s, paths and p&l impacts of each. 139195 from kingsgate to malin ($182,030) 139196 from kingsgate to pgen/tuscarora ($ 4,024) 139197 from kingsgate to pgen malin ($ 8,271) 231321 from kingsgate to malin ($ 38,705) 153771 from kingsgate to stanfield ($ 1,988) suggested fix: change pgen kingsgate mapping from gdp-malin citygate to gdp-kingsgate. clay basin storage--this is really a fyi more than anything else--i see five different tickets in sitara for clay basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections. clay basin is valued as a questar curve, which is substantially below nwpl points. what this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. i\\'m not sure of the best way to handle this since we don\\'t really have a systematic sitara way of handling storage deals. in an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. anyway, here\\'s the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus i noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from clay basin. there may be an operational reason why this occurred that i\\'m not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but i thought i\\'d bring it to your attention just in case there\\'s something you want to do about it. the columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p&l associated with each. deal # 251327 159540 265229 106300 201756 p&l $29,503 ($15,960) ($3,199) ($2,769) ($273) rec: ques/clay basin/0184 nwpl/opal 543 nwpl/opal sumas nwpl/s of gr rvr del: nwpl/s of green river/clay ques/clay basin/0852 ques/clay basin/0852 ques/clay basin ques/clay basin 1 329 8,738 2 1,500 3 2,974 11,362 4 6,741 12,349 1,439 5 19,052 3,183 9 333 13 30,863 2,680 14 30,451 15 35,226 16 6,979 235 17 17,464 18 9,294 20 10,796 771 21 17,930 22 10,667 23 14,415 9,076 25 23,934 8,695 26 3,284 27 1,976 28 1,751 29 1,591 30 20,242 mary, if we add both balances together the total is $1,140. i can spread it over 6 or 12 months. 6 month payout would be $190/month. 12 month payout would be $95/month. your choice. i would like it if you could work 5/hrs each friday for another month or so. does $10/hr sound fair?

are there any services we provide? how much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? who are your main contacts at sw gas? we will propose to provide a full requirements supply to sw involving our control of their assets. for this to be attractive to sw, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. this will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. that risk may not be acceptable to the desk. i will do some investigation of their pga\\'s and see if there is an opportunity. as to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? are there elements that you would like to see? any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated. thanks, laird kay & neal, thanks for remembering my birthday. you beat my parents by one day. the family is doing fine. grace is really smiling. she is a very happy baby as long as she is being held. it sounds like your house is coming along fast. i think my folks are ready to start building. we will probably visit in late june or july. may is busy. we are taking the kids to disney for their birthdays. good luck on the house. keith ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 04/26/2000 08:40 am --------------------------- tim heizenrader 04/25/2000 11:43 am to: jim fallon/hou/ect@ect, phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: tim belden/hou/ect@ect subject: western strategy session materials today\\'s charts are attached: ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 04/26/2000 08:36 am --------------------------- tim heizenrader 04/25/2000 11:43 am to: jim fallon/hou/ect@ect, phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: tim belden/hou/ect@ect subject: western strategy session materials today\\'s charts are attached: are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?

financing bills may not meet their may 8th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance/bridge loan by the may 8th deadline. any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart. according to sources, both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis. the democratic caucus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for davis. many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund, davis would \"double dip\" into the fund. clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor. however, it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1, 2001. if not, the state may be in breach of contract. sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th, having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult. the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion. however, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession. sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward. currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan; ab 8x and ab 31x. ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. this bill passed the senate in march, but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support. ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts. however, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen, currently in ab 8x. senator bowen\\'s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy). according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature, republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund. for instance, tony strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion) should be issued. other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday. additionally, lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan. key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount: $4.125 b lenders: jp morgan $2.5 b lehman brothers $1.0 b bear stearns $625 m tax exempt portion: of the $4.125 b; $1.6 b is expected to be tax-exempt projected interest rate: taxable rate 5.77% tax-exempt rate 4.77% current projected blended ir: 5.38% maturity date: august 29, 2001 for more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510 bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday, but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday, which authorizes $5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority. the $5 billion authorized under sb 6x is not the same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward. again, the republicans are not in support of these authorizations. without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has negotiated, the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support. no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power. also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for the california public power and conservation authority. however, this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis. socal edison and bankruptcy at this point, two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy. the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor. the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. according to sources, the state has yet to sign the mou with socal, though socal has signed it. the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass. if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. the second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x (bridge loan) stating that the dwr would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount. in other words, the state will get paid before the utilities. if this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy. socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments. ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 05/04/2001 10:15 am --------------------------- james d steffes@enron 05/03/2001 05:44 am to: phillip k

out of the trip. especially if you have to prepare a presentation. i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. as far as the business meetings, i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. my suggestion for where to go is austin. play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski\\'s. flying somewhere takes too much time. tim, mike grigsby is having problems with accessing the west power site. can you please make sure he has an active password. thank you, phillip reagan, just wanted to give you an update. i have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12. kipp flores is working on the construction drawings. at the same time i am pursuing fha financing. once the construction drawings are complete i will send them to you for a revised

tim, can you authorize access to the west power site for keith holtz. he is our southern california basis trader and is under a two year contract. on another note, is it my imagination or did the sarr website lower its forecast for mcnary discharge during may. it seems like the flows have been lowered into the 130 range and there are fewer days near 170. also the second half of april doesn\\'t seem to have panned out as i expected. the outflows stayed at 100-110 at mcnary. can you email or call with some additional insight? thank you, phillip gary, i have also been speaking to johnnie brown in san antonio to be the general contractor. according to johnnie, i would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region. assuming this is true, i will work directly with him. i believe he has sent you my plans. they were prepared by kipp flores architects. can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor? if you have the estimates worked up for johnnie will you please email them to me as well? thank you for your time. i am excited about potentially using your product. phillip allen ray, is there any detail on the gas cost proxy. which delivery points from which publication will be used?

demand reduction phillip et al., i have been digging into the answer to your question re: demand reduction in the west. your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., march 2001 vs. march 2000) was absolutely correct. at this point, it appears that demand over the last 12 months in the caiso control area, after adjusting for temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%. this translates into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 mwa for last month (march 2001) as compared with the previous year. looking forward into the summer, i believe that we will see further voluntary reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts). other forecasters (e.g., pira) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 mwa (making total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in june. this scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. given that the 6% decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, i think that it is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last year. this would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 mwa in jun-aug. in addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation are being promoted by the state, which can only increase the likelihood of meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 mwa figure. finally, the general economic slowdown in calif could also further depress demand, or at least make the 3,500 mwa number that much more attainable. note that all the numbers i am reporting here are for the caiso control area only, which represents about 89% of total calif load, or 36-37% of wscc (u.s.) summer load. i think it is reasonable to assume that the non-iso portion of calif (i.e., ladwp and iid) will see similar reductions in demand. as for the rest of the wscc, that is a much more difficult call. as you are aware, the pacific nw has already seen about 2,000 mwa of aluminum smelter load come off since dec, and this load is expected to stay off at least through sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if bpa gets its wish). this figure represents approx 4% of the non-calif wscc. several mining operations in the sw and rockies have recently announced that they are sharply curtailing production. i have not yet been able to pin down exactly how many mw this translates to, but i will continue to research the issue. other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from calif\\'s economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the west. while the rest of the wscc may not see the 10%+ reductions that i am expecting in calif, i think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 mwa, of further demand reduction in the non-calif wscc for this summer. this would bring the total reduction for the wscc, including the 2,000 mwa aluminum load we have already seen, to around 6,500-7,000 mwa when compared with last summer. i am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you with updates as new or better information becomes available. meantime, i hope this helps. please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any questions or need any further information. lucy,

my closing has been postponed. as i mentioned i am going to have cary kipp draw the plans for the residence and i will get back in touch with you once he is finished. regarding the multifamily project, i am going to work with a project manager from san antonio. for my first development project, i feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining fha financing. we are working with kipp flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings. your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates. i am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships. i will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan. phillip allen jacques, the amounts needed to fill in the blanks on exhibit \"b\" are as follows: kipp flores-total contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 is outstanding. kohutek- $2,150 cuatro- $37,800 george & larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and i agreed to reimburse this amount. the total cash that keith and i will pay the sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 appraisal and $2,375 engineering). i couldn\\'t find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers. let me know if i need to do anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed. phillip john, regarding the employment agreement, mike declined without a counter. keith said he would sign for $75k cash/$250 equity. i still believe frank should receive the same signing incentives as keith. phillip thanks for the response. i think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step. i had already contacted cary kipp and sent him the floor plan. he got back to me yesterday with his first draft. he took my plan and improved it. i am going to officially engage cary to draw the plans. while he works on those i wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list. also, i would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners. i will be in san marcos on friday april 13th. are there any homes near completion that i could walk through that day? also can you provide some references? once i have the plans and specs, i will send them to you so you can adjust your bid. phillip do you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders. phillip

employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the allen center or met garages are being offered a parking space in the new enron center garage. this is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. the cost for the new garage will be the same as allen center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00. if you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the enron center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. the saturn ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. all initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to enron center north until saturn ring access is available. garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. if you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to parking and transportation as soon as you reach a decision. following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage. the parking and transportation desk may be reached via email at parking and transportation/corp/enron or 713-853-7060 with any questions. (you must enter & exit on clay st. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of bell & smith.) https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/ jacques i am out of the office for the rest of the week. have you ever seen anyone miss as much work as i have in the last 6 weeks? i assure you this is unusual for me. hopefully we can sign some documents on monday. call me on my cell phone if you need me. phillip reagan, i am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? what role would you play in obtaining financing? any experience with fha 221(d) loans? although your fees are lower than george and larry i am still getting market quotes lower yet. i have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit i just wanted to give you this initial feedback. i have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. as you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. i am not thrilled about such a low return. i think i need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. any ideas? i realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. i am not discounting those services. i will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but i will call you early next week. phillip cary, here is the picture of the house i have in mind. i was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near wimberley. a few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: there will be a double porch across the back just like the front no dormers (metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs overall dimensions are 55 by 40 what i am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. more cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. reagan suggested that i find a way to make the exterior more attractive. i want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but i was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. that might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. also the front porch would be smaller. i have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. i am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so i can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. i just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. as i mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. i thought that since i had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that reagan allowed. phillip allen 713-853-7041

a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near wimberley. a few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: there will be a double porch across the back just like the front no dormers (metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs overall dimensions are 55 by 40 what i am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. more cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. reagan suggested that i find a way to make the exterior more attractive. i want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but i was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. that might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. also the front porch would be smaller. i have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. i am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so i can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. i just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. as i mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. i thought that since i had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that reagan allowed. phillip allen 713-853-7041 ---------------------- forwarded by

you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary. unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk. phillip no problem reagan, thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. below is a list of questions on the specs: 1. is the framing lumber #2 yellow pine? wouldn\\'t fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. what type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. what type for roof framing? on site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? what type of insulation in floors and ceiling? batts or blown? fiberglass or cellulose? 5. any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? i didn\\'t know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. on the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? i was thinking a partial one out of iron. only about 5 feet. 9. i did not label it on the plan, but i was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. a pedestal sink would probably work. 10. are undermount sinks different than drop ins? i was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 a/c units? i am assuming 2. 12. prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. no door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. exterior porches included in bid? cedar decking on upstairs? iron railings? 15. what type of construction contract would you use? fixed price except for change orders? i want to get painfully detailed with the specs before i make a decision but this is a start. i think i am ready to get plans drawn up. i am going to call cary kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if i like his ideas. phillip i larry, jacques has sent a document to claudia for your review. just dropping you a line to confirm that you have seen it. phillip jacques, would it be ok if i signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect? they have both sent me agreements. the only payment that george and larry had made was $2,350 to the architect. i have written personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the engineer. i was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership. i would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me. should i wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership. let me know what you think. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 03/27/2001 02:29 pm ---------------------------

(gross)/$36/sf (rentable) what do the cost for on-site general requirements ( $299,818) represent? will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? you mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. why is profit only 4%? why are the architect fees up to $200k. i thought they would be $80k. what is the $617k of profit allowance? is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? total closing and application costs of 350k? that seems very high? who receives the 2 points? how much will be sunk costs if fha declines us? where is your 1%? are you receiving one of the points on the loan? what is the status on the operating pro forma? my back of the envelope puts noi at $877k assuming 625/1br, 1300/3br, 950/2br, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses. after debt service that would only leave $122k. the coverage would only be 1.16. talk to you this afternoon. phillip grif, please provide a temporary id phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k

he still wants to receive this payment. phillip reagan, here is a photograhph of the house i have in mind. specific features include: stained and scored concrete floors downstairs wood stairs two story porches on front and rear granite counters in kitchens and baths tile floors in upstairs baths metal roof w/ gutters (no dormers) cherry or maple cabinets in kitchen & baths solid wood interior doors windows fully trimmed crown molding in downstairs living areas 2x6 wall on west side undecided items include: vinyl or aluminum windows wood or carpet in upstairs bedrooms and game room exterior stucco w/ stone apron and window trim or rough white brick on 3-4 sides i have faxed you the floor plans. the dimensions may be to small to read. the overall dimensions are 55\\' x 40\\'. for a total of 4400 sq ft under roof, but only 3800 of livable space after you deduct the garage. are there any savings in the simplicity of the design? it is basically a box with a simple roof line. call me if

friday unless i wire the money. if that is what i need to do please send wiring instructions. greg, something that i forgot to ask you. do you know if hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which i understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks? also let me know about the parking. the builder in san marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code. the townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem. they probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms. phillip keith holst sent you an email with the details. jacques, the agreement looks fine. my only comment is that george and larry might object to the language that \"the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the project\". technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. did i loan them $1,300,000? i thought it was less. regarding exhibit a, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. i have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. i am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. the obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 03/26/2001

able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal). one point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied. i looked at the closing statements and i didn\\'t see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. can you help clear this up. assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released. keith and i are concerned about taking over the bishop corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities. on the other

behind the stage two fyi western price survey contacts cal-iso\\'s declaration of stage two alert this morning was triggered in part by decision of bonneville power administration to cease hour-to-hour sales into california of between 600 mw and 1,000 mw that it had been making for the past week. according to bpa, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. the agency said it had been telling california\\'s department of water resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended. cal-iso reported about 1,600 mw less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. yesterday, powerex said it was not selling into california because of concerns about its water reserves. bpa said it is still sending exchange energy into california, however. more details, if available, will be included in the friday edition of the western price survey and in california energy markets newsletter. thanks for the information. it would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned. i am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this january. i have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock. i believe i selected

subject: bishops corner, ltd. -- restructure or buyout dear phillip and keith: we are prepared to sell bishops corner, ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? as shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? the due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? as it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4mm fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? for the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4mm fee has been earned to date.? for the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2mm. ?however, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? as shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? we still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? however, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? if this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, claudia crocker, no later than friday of this week.? the attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the bishops corner, ltd. partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. thank you. ? sincerely, [image] ? ? ? george w. richards

received some information on the status of the work done to date. i spoke to hugo alexandro at cuatro consultants. the property is still in two parcels. hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of san marcos. he has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. in addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. the total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. we are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. if we can continue to use cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. hugo\\'s number is 512-295-8052. i thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. i spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by kipp flores can be used. keith and i appreciate you meeting with us on sunday. we left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project. call me with feedback after you speak to hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward. phillip here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format. the summary presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions. jacques, george finally sent me some information. please look over his email. he wants us to buy him out. keith and i think this is a joke. we still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward. i don\\'t believe the architect work will be of any use to us. i don\\'t think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market. my version of a buyout is attached. i need your expert advise. i am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose. do they have a case that they are due money for their time? since their cost and fees didn\\'t hold up versus the market and we didn\\'t execute a contract, i wouldn\\'t think they would stand a chance. there isn\\'t any time to waste so i want to respond to their offer asap. call me with your thoughts. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 03/14/2001

77002-7361 subject: bishops corner, ltd. -- restructure or buyout dear phillip and keith: we are prepared to sell bishops corner, ltd. for reimbursement of our cash expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of all note obligations and design contracts.? as shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company, and appraisal total $67,050.? the due on these contracts is $61,175, of which current unpaid invoices due total $37,325. acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design and other pre-construction elements.? as it is a major project for a firm of our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a percentage of the minimum $1.4mm fee we were to have earned and 2) based on your prior valuation of our time.? for the first, we feel that at least 25%, or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4mm fee has been earned to date.? for the second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? either of these valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2mm. ?however, in the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? as shown in the attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings the total net buyout to $78,946.? we still believe that this project needs the professional services that we offer and have provided.? however, if you accept the terms of this buyout offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? if this is your choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, claudia crocker, no later than friday of this week.? the attorneys can then draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the bishops corner, ltd. partnership to you following receipt of the buyout amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts. thank you. ? sincerely, [image] ? ? ? george w. richards

andrew m ozuna/tx/bancone on 03/07/2001 01:41 pm --------------------------- andrew m ozuna 03/06/2001 03:14 pm to: \"george richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> cc: subject: sagewood phase ii george, thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the sagewood phase ii project. upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. there are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the bank moving forward on the transaction. first, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a bedroom to bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. we adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing sagewood project. additionally, there are about 500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the city of san marcos, this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project. we have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000. i have summarized our issues as follows: 1. pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows: pro-forma bank\\'s adjustment unit unit rent rent/br unit rent rent/br 2 br/2.5 ba $1,150 $575 $950 $475 3 br/unit $1,530 $510 $1,250 $417 2. pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over. 3. a market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to potential gross income (pgi). 4. based on the bank\\'s revised n.o.i. of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate. 5. the debt service will be approx. $874,000/year. 6. given the debt of $8,868,000, the borrower will be required to provide equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following: land - $1,121,670 deferred profit& overhead $ 415,000 cash equity $1,419,268 total $2,955,938 7. equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage of actual hard construction costs. (see attached file: mapttra.xls) - mapttra.xls darrell, today i let the builder/developer know that i would not proceed with his excessively high cost estimates. as he did not have the funds to take on the land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me. i would like to proceed and develop the property. my thought is to compare the financing between bank one and fha. i would also like to compare construction and development services between what you can do and a local builder in san marcos that i have been speaking with. making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to be in order. i am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural work to date. once again the architect is kipp florres and the engineer is quattro consultants out of buda. let me know if you have an opinion about either. i look forward to working with you. talk to you tomorrow. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 03/07/2001 01:00 pm --------------------------- tim heizenrader 03/05/2001 09:06 am to: phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: tim belden/hou/ect@ect, chris gaskill/corp/enron@enron subject: revised long range hydro forecast phillip: here\\'s a summary of our current forecast(s) for pnw hydro. please give me a call when you have time, and i\\'ll explain the old biop / new biop issue. tim reagan, here is the cost estimate and proforma prepared by george and larry. i am faxing the site plan, elevation, and floor plans. phillip i just refaxed. please confirm receipt i faxed you the signed amendment. daryl, here is the file that includes the proforma, unit costs, and comps. this file was prepared by the builder/developer. the architect that has begun to work on the project is kipp flores. they are in austin. thank you for your time this evening. your comments were very helpful. i appreciate you and greg taking a look at this project. phillip allen pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041 al, i was not going to do the ms this year. thanks for the offer though. all is well here. we went to colorado last week and the kids learned to ski. work is same as always. how are things going at new power? is there any potential? phillip john, did you put frank hayden up to this? if this decision is up to me i would= =20 consider authorizing mike g., frank e., keith h. and myself to trade west= =20 power. what do you think? phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 03/06/2001= =20 10:48 am --------------------------- from: frank hayden/enron@enronxgate on 03/05/2001 09:27 am cst to: phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: =20 subject: fw: cross commodity -----original message----- from: hayden, frank =20 sent: friday, march 02, 2001 7:01 pm to: presto, kevin; zufferli, john; mckay, jonathan; belden, tim; shively,= =20 hunter; neal, scott; martin, thomas; allen, phillip; arnold, john subject: cross commodity importance: high i=01,ve been asked to provide an updated list on who is authorized to cross= =20 trade what commodities/products. as soon as possible, please reply to this= =20 email with the names of only the authorized =01&cross commodity=018 traders= and=20 their respective commodities.

#26 i see that she paid a deposit. but the file says she moved in on 1/30. has she ever paid rent? i can\\'t find any on the last three deposits. #44 have the paid for february? there is no payment since the beginning of the year. #33 you email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but i don\\'t see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?

i want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction. 2. second, without the forward or take-out our typical loan to cost (ltc) will be in the range of 75% - 80%. the proposed loan to value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical multi-family deal. given the above pro-forma performance on the sagewood townhomes, i am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% ltc. this, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal. 3. the bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the developers deferred profit. typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable. thanks, andrew ozuna real estate loan officer 210-271-8386 ## attached are two files that illustrate the following: as prices rose, supply increased and demand decreased. now prices are beginning to fall in response these market responses. ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 02/23/2001 11:17 am --------------------------- from: jeffrey oh 02/02/2001 08:51 am to: phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect, julie a gomez/hou/ect@ect, tim belden/hou/ect@ect, robert badeer/hou/ect@ect, matt motley/pdx/ect@ect, mike swerzbin/hou/ect@ect, jim gilbert/pdx/ect@ect, david parquet/sf/ect@ect, ccalger@enron.com, jim buerkle/pdx/ect@ect, elliot mainzer/pdx/ect@ect, jeffrey oh/pdx/ect@ect, todd perry/pdx/ect@ect, laird dyer/sf/ect@ect, michael mcdonald/sf/ect@ect, ed clark/pdx/ect@ect, dave fuller/pdx/ect@ect, alan comnes/pdx/ect@ect, michael etringer/hou/ect@ect, john malowney/hou/ect@ect, stewart rosman/hou/ect@ect, jeff shields/pdx/ect@ect cc: subject: new generation report for january 2001 you can fax it anytime. but i saved the spreadsheets from the previous estimates. what will be different in the fax?

sufficient, but there will be additional updates. the manager\\'s unit is columns j-l, but the total is not included in the b&n total of rentable units. rather, the total cost for the manager\\'s unit

<cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 02/21/2001 06:32:15 am please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> to: \"phillip allen\" <pallen@enron.com> cc: \"larry lewter\" <llewter@austin.rr.com> subject: sm134 proforma2.xls there have been some updates to the cost. the principal change is in the addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which i estimate will costs at least $84,000 additional. also, the trim material and labor costs have been increased. i still believe that the total cost is more than sufficient, but there will be additional updates. the manager\\'s unit is columns j-l, but the total is not included in the b&n total of rentable units. rather, the total cost for the manager\\'s unit and office is included as a lump sum under amenities. i may add this back in as a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity. the financing cost has been changed in that the cost of the permanent mortgage has been deleted because we will not need to obtain this for the construction loan approval, therefore, its cost will be absorbed when this loan is obtained. based on either a loan equal to 75% of value or 80% of cost, the construction profit should cover any equity required beyond the land. george w. richards creekside builders, llc - sm134 proforma2.xls john, does next thursday at 3pm fit your schedule to go over the rockies forecasts? i will set up a room with kim. here are some suggestions for projects for colleen: 1. review and document systems and processes - the handoffs from erms, tagg, unify, sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements. i think i understand erms and tagg but the issues facing scheduling in unify are grey. 2. review and audit complex deals- under the \"assume it is messed up\" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. review risk books- is enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. lead trading track program- recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. fundamentals- liason between trading and analysts. are we looking at everything we should? putting a person with a trading mentality should add some value and direction to the group. in fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second md to work part time to get it done. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 12/13/2000 11:28 am --------------------------- from: sarah novosel@enron on 12/13/2000 10:17 am cst

meeting with george and larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. then there is a layer of \"construction management\" fees of 10%. there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. but i think the majority of it is profit. finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. keith and i were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. after all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? we were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. i reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but i don\\'t think the construction management fee is included. george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. i will review and let you know what i think. the gp issues don\\'t seem to be a point of contention. they are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. let me know if you have opinions or sources that i can use to push for only true costs + 1.4 million. phillip george, please send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning. phillip jeanie, lavorato called me into his office to question me about my inquiries into part time. nice confidentiality. since i have already gotten the grief, it would be nice to get some useful information. what did you find out about part time, leave of absences, and sabbaticals? my interest is for 2002. phillip

this friday. sorry it is so late. there are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 1. i know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. the missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2. #1 did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3. #3 did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4. #11 missed on 2/2? 5. #13 missed on 1/26? 6. #14 missed on 2/2? 7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8. #20a missed on 2/2? 9. #35 missed on 2/2? my guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. you may have sent me a message over the \"chat\" line that i don\\'t remember on some of these. i just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. will have some time today to work on a utility letter. tried to call wade last night at 5:30 but couldn\\'t reach him. will try again today. i believe that a doctor from seguin is going to make an offer. did you meet them? if so, what did you think? phillip i will email you an updated operating statement with nov and dec tomorrow morning. what did the seguin doctor think of the place. how much could i get the stagecoach appraised for? do you still do appraisals? could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap? jacques, can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? the key business points are: 1. investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. construction contract is cost plus $1.4 million 3. the investors\\' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. all parties are gp\\'s but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. with regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. keith and i would like to oversee the bookkeeping. the builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours. we also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted. let me know if you can draft these agreements. the gp issue may need some tweaking. phillip allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com lucy, here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save. my only questions are: 1. neil moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 12/01. even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the beginning of the two week period. what is going on? 2.

too many to list individually jeff, my target is to get $225 back out of the stage. therefore, i could take a sales price of $740k and carry a second note of $210k. this would still only require $75k cash from the buyer. after broker fees and a title policy, i would net around $20k cash. you can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email. do you want to give the new braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. phillip jeff, i am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. there are several reasons that i won\\'t commit to this. exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. what i am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. the existing note does not come due until september 2009. that is a long time. the buyer may have sold the property. interest rates may be lower. i am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. can you clarify the dates in the contract. is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. i got your fax from the new braunfels buyer. if we can\\'t come to terms with the first buyer i will get started on the list. email or call me later

off-line power plants 13:18 gmt 7 december 2000 dj cal-iso pays $10m to avoid rolling blackouts wed -sources (this article was originally published wednesday) los angeles (dow jones)--the california independent system operator paid about $10 million wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from powerex and still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the iso\\'s operation told dow jones newswires. but the iso fell short of ordering rolling blackouts wednesday for the third consecutive day. the iso wouldn\\'t comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market information. but sources said powerex, a subsidiary of british columbia hydro & power authority (x.bch), is the only energy company in the northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the iso paid about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening. but that still wasn\\'t enough juice. the los angeles department of water and power sold the iso 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of $250/mwh. the ladwp, which is not governed by the iso, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. it is free sell power instate above the $250/mwh price cap. the ladwp has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. the municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. however, the ladwp is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. the suit claims the ladwp sells some of its power it gets from the federal bonneville power administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. powerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the iso power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. but the company also sold the iso 1,000 megawatts tuesday - minutes before the iso was to declare rolling blackouts - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said. the iso, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. the iso is having to compete with investor-owned utilities in the northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. the iso warned federal regulators, generators and utilities wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency wednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. a stage three is declared when the iso\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. but iso spokesman patrick dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. \"in order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\" dorinson said. edison international unit (eix) southern california edison, sempra energy unit (sre) san diego gas & electric, pg&e corp. (pcg) unit pacific gas & electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. socal edison and pg&e are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. the utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. it\\'s still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. -by jason leopold, dow jones newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com (end) dow jones newswires 07-12-00 1318gmt copyright (c) 2000, dow jones & company inc 13:17 gmt 7 december 2000 dj calif iso, puc inspect off-line duke south bay pwr plant (this article was originally published wednesday) los angeles (dow jones)--representatives of the california independent system operator and public utilities commission inspected duke energy corp.\\'s (duk) off-line 700-mw south bay power plant in chula vista, calif., wednesday morning, a duke spokesman said. the iso and puc have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, iso spokesman pat dorinson said. about 11,000 mw of power has been off the state\\'s power grid since monday, 7,000 mw of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the iso. the iso manages grid reliability. as previously reported, the iso told utilities and the federal energy regulatory commission wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 pm pst (0100 gmt thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. however, the iso said the action wouldn\\'t result in rolling blackouts. the iso and puc also inspected tuesday plants owned by dynegy inc (dyn), reliant energy inc. (rei) and southern energy inc (soe). duke\\'s 1,500-mw moss landing plant was also inspected by puc representatives in june, when some units were off-line for repairs, the duke spokesman said. -by jessica berthold, dow jones newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (end) dow jones newswires 07-12-00 1317gmt copyright (c) 2000, dow jones & company inc 13:17 gmt 7 december 2000 =dj calif regulators visit aes,dynegy off-line power plants (this article was originally published wednesday) by jessica berthold of dow jones newswires los angeles (dow jones)--aes corp. (aes) and dynegy inc. (dyn) said wednesday that representatives of california power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. the california independent system operator, which manages the state\\'s power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the california public utilities commission began on-site inspections tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, iso spokesman pat dorinson said. the state has had 11,000 mw off the grid since monday, 7,000 mw for unplanned maintenance. the iso wednesday called a stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. as reported earlier, reliant energy (rei) and southern energy inc. (soe) said they had been visited by representatives of the iso and puc tuesday evening. representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by aes and dynegy tuesday evening. aes told the visitors they couldn\\'t perform an unannounced full inspection of the company\\'s 450-megawatt huntington beach power station until wednesday morning, when the plant\\'s full staff would be present, aes spokesman aaron thomas said. thomas, as well as an iso spokesman, didn\\'t know whether the representatives returned wednesday for a full inspection. aes units down due to expired emissions credits the huntington beach facility and units at two other aes facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or nox, emission credits. they were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the south coast air quality management district to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, thomas said. aes has about 2,000 mw, or half its maximum output, off line. the entire huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 mw worth of units at its alamitos and redondo beach plants. the iso has asked aes to return its off line plants to operations, but aes has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. \"we\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\" thomas said. \"it\\'s not clear to us that the iso trumps the air quality district\\'s\" authority. as reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said tuesday that aes could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so. dynegy\\'s el segundo plant also visited by puc dynegy inc. (dyn) said the puc visited its 1,200 mw el segundo plant tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 mw worth, were off line wednesday. \"i guess our position is, \\'gee, we\\'re sorry you don\\'t believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that\\'s fine,\\'\" said dynegy spokesman lynn lednicky. lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. \"we\\'ve been doing all we can to get back in service,\" lednicky said. \"we even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\" lednicky added that the puc seemed satisfied with dynegy\\'s explanation of why its units were off line. -by jessica berthold, dow

by monday. i will let you know as soon as i hear from them. phillip george, the probability of building a house this year is increasing. i have shifted to a slightly different plan. there were too many design items that i could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. now, i am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. one wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. the other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. this plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. i am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. the center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. i am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. i don\\'t know if you can imagine the house i am trying to describe. i would like to come and visit you again this month. if it would work for you, i would like to drive up on sunday afternoon on feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. i would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn\\'t have time for. i can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. call or email to let me know if this would work for you. pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work) phillip allen ps. channel 2 in houston ran a

subject: testing jeff, before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. there are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. what is an outside management firm going to do? a full time onsite manager is all that is required. as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. considering #1 & #2 $115,000 noi is not necessarily overstated. if you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4. getting cash out is not a priority to me. so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. a 10% note actually attractive. see below. my job just doesn\\'t give me the time to manage this property. this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. sales price 705,000 1st lien 473,500 2nd lien 225,000 transfer fee 7,500 cash required 14,500 noi 100,000 1st lien 47,292 2nd lien 23,694 cash flow 29,014 cash on cash 200% these numbers are using the conservative noi, if it comes in at $115k then cash on cash return would be more like 300%. this doesn\\'t reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price. do you want to reconsider? let me know. phillip

cpuc audit report on edison the following are the highlights from the executive summary of the kpmg aud= it=20 report on southern california edison: =20 i. cash needs highlights: sce=01,s original cash forecast, dated as december 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of february 1, 2001. since then sce has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, sce=01,s=20 available cash improved through january 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. the actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. ii. credit relationships highlights: sce has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. at present, there are no additional sources of credit open to sce. sce=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. sce=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. credit ratings agencies have downgraded sce=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. iii. energy cost scenarios highlights this report section uses different cpuc supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon sce=01,s projected cash depletion dates. under= such=20 scenarios, sce would have a positive cash balance until march 30, 2001. iv. cost containment initiatives highlights sce has adopted a $460 million cost reduction plan for the year 2001. the plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): operating and maintenance costs $ 77 capital improvement costs 383 total $ 460 the plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. under the plan, capital improvement costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. sce dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. v. accounting mechanisms to track stranded cost recovery (tra and tcba=20 activity) highlights: as of december 31, 2000, sce reported an overcollected balance in the=20 transition cost balancing account (tcba) account of $494.5 million. this=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. as of december 31, 2000, sce reported an undercollected balance in sce=01,s= =20 transition account (tra) of $4.49 billion. normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the tcba at th= e=20 end of each year. however, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the tcba, pursuant to=20 d.01-01-018. costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the tra and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the tcba. because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the tra, are overstated. turn proposal as part of our review, the cpuc asked that we comment on the proposal of tu= rn=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 our comments are summarized as follows: the proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of sce in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. the proposal=01,s impact on sce=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. turn=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and= the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the tra is overstated. vi. flow of funds analysis highlights: in the last five years, sce had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a= =20 positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. during the same time period, sce paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, edison international, of approximately $4.8 billion. edison international used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its= =20 shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm= on=20 stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati= ve=20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. [there is no section vii] =20 viii. earnings of california affiliates sce=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500= =20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20 in 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.= =20 this increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period. a copy of the report is available on the commission website at=20 www.cpuc.ca.gov. =20 dan lucy, what is the latest? write me a note about what is going on and what issues you need my help to

if i could get a personal guarantee and jaques craig can work out the partnership transfer, i would definitely be willing to carry a second lien. i understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. checkout this spreadsheet. these numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes. however, i am very concerned about the way it is being shown. having lucy show it is not a good idea. i need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property. my dad doesn\\'t have the time and i don\\'t trust lucy or wade to show it correctly. i would prefer for you to show it from now on. i will have the operating statements complete through december by this friday. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 01/29/2001 12:14 pm --------------------------- to: <cbpres@austin.rr.com> cc: subject: re: sm134 george, here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. at permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, i feel the 65/35 is a fair split. however, as i mentioned earlier, i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. builder doesn\\'t benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in november) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule this way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 phillip george, we should hear from the bank in houston on monday. the best numbers and times to reach me: work

the last e-mail i sent includes the latest version of the iep proposal. negotiations with sce on this proposal are essentially complete. pg&e is ok with the docs. all qfs but calpine have agreed with the iep proposal -- under the proposal, pg&e would \"retain\" $106 million (of what, i\\'m not sure -- i think they mean a refund to pg&e from qfs who switched to px pricing). the money would come from changing the basis for the qf payments from the px price to the srac price, starting back in december (and maybe earlier). pg&e will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the force majeure notices off the table. qfs are asking iep to attempt to get some assurances of payment. sce has defaulted with its qfs; pg&e has not yet -- but big payments are due on 2/2/01. for gas-fired qfs -- heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for pg&e\\'s purchases from such qfs. two people are negotiating the these agreements (elcantar and bloom), but they are going very slowly. not clear this can be resolved. batten and keeley are refereeing this. no discussions on this occurred today. status of legislation -- keeley left town for the night, so not much will happen on the qfs.assembly and senate realize they have to work together. plan to meld together ab 1 with hertzberg\\'s new bill . hydro as security is dead. republicans were very much opposed to it. patti, this

22:15 as natural gas prices rose in december, traders at the new york mercantile exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \"traders do that all the time; they\\'re looking forward,\" said william burson, a trader. \"it makes the market for natural gas.\" but the market\\'s response perplexed chris mcgill, the american gas association\\'s director of gas supply and transportation. he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. \"it\\'s a little frustrating that they don\\'t take the time to understand what we are reporting,\" mcgill said. as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street. stephen adik, senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\\'s speculators for the rise in gas prices. \"it\\'s my firm belief ... that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" adik told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly. in california, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter\\'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. \"we\\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said paul snider, a spokesman for missouri gas energy. but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \"there\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,\" said ed krapels, director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc., an energy consulting firm in wakefield, mass. hot topic consumers know one thing for certain: their heating bills are up sharply. in many circles, little else is discussed. the rev. vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is facing a $1,456 december bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous december\\'s bill. church members are suffering from higher bills as well. the sunday collection is down, said fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. for the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \"it\\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said. a year ago that wasn\\'t a fear. wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn\\'t make it worthwhile to drill for gas. utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. but trouble was brewing. by spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. there was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. by early november, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. the federal energy information administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. but $10 gas was coming. below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the kansas city area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. \"it\\'s all about the weather,\" said krapels of energy security analysis. wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the new york traders. natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. setting the price in the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. in 1990, the new york mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. and big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. but if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don\\'t need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they\\'re trading. like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. that leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders\\' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. as december began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. by the end of the month it was nearly $10. much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association\\'s weekly storage numbers. utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer\\'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. still, the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. but when below-normal temperatures arrived in november, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. then the american gas association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. still, said the association\\'s mcgill, there was sufficient gas in storage. but some utility executives didn\\'t share that view. william eliason, vice president of kansas gas service, said that if december\\'s cold snap had continued into january, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \"i was getting worried,\" he said. then suddenly the market turned when january\\'s weather turned warmer. wednesday\\'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. among area utilities, kansas gas service increased its customers\\' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. and missouri gas energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin wednesday. sheila lumpe, chairwoman of the missouri public service commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. missouri gas energy has no hedging program. it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. on friday, doug micheel, senior counsel of the missouri office of the public counsel, said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energy\\'s gas purchasing practices. \"consumers are taking all the risk,\" micheel said. \"it\\'s time to consider some changes.\" to reach steve everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to severly@kcstar.com. -- all content , 2001 the kansas city star message

please update all lease information on the 1/12 rentroll and email it to me this afternoon. phillip larry, do you want the loan and wire amount to be for exactly $1.1 million. phillip thanks for representing matt. phillip george, here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. at permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, i feel the 65/35 is a fair split. however, as i mentioned earlier, i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. builder doesn\\'t benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in november) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule this way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 phillip lucy, here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages. there are alot of overages. it will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather. you need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap. this needs to be handwritten on all new leases. i am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet. we also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don\\'t want to exceed their cap. i will write something today. wait until you

interested in speaking to you as an advisor or at least a sounding board for the key issues. please email or call. phillip allen pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041 questions about 12/29 rentroll: there were two deposits that were not labeled. one for $150 and the other for $75. which apartments? 20a or #13? utility overages for #26 and #44? where did you get these amounts? for what periods? what is going on with #42. do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! that will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. i would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. if that doesn\\'t work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. this tenant has been here since september 1998, i don\\'t want to run them off. i check with the bank and i did not see that a deposit was made on tuesday so i couldn\\'t check the total from the rentroll against the bank. is this right? has the deposit been made yet? a rentroll for jan 5th will follow

attendance were ken lay, the governor, the governor\\'s staff director (kari dohn) and myself. the gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas. he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday. attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared. below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor\\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor\\'s comments: overview: we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees. his staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level. he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000mw). he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by \\'02 and provide some political cover. our proposals: i have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided). he seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases. as already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. his ideas: the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\". some of these ideas would require legislative action. state may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of generation plants. the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. this was a frequently recurring theme. utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers. municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california. state universities (including uc/csu and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation. expand in-state gas production. take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies. empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time. condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how nordpool works(jeff- someone in schroeder\\'s group should be able to help out here). wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators. securitize uncollected power purchase costs. to dos: (jeff, again i\\'d like to prevail on you to assemble the group\\'s thoughts and get them to kari) he wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips. he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday. he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal. he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues. thanks to everyone for their help. we made some progress today.

statement. if you have any trouble downloading or printing these files let me know and i can fax them to you. let\\'s talk later today. phillip p.s. please remember to get jim murnan the info. he needs. gentlemen, i continue to speak to an attorney for help with the investment structure and a mortgage broker for help with the financing. regarding the financing, i am working with jim murnan at pinnacle mortgage here in houston. i have sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information on you. can you please send it to him. his contact information is: phone (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net. i know larry has been working with a bank and they need my information. i hope to pull that together this afternoon. i took the liberty of calling thomas reames from the frog pond document. he was positive about his experience overall. he did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor. i think we should discuss these procedures in advance. let\\'s continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur. phillip jim, i would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project i described to you last week. the project is a 134 unit apartment complex in san marcos. there will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. as i mentioned last week, i would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. if there is a creative way to structure the deal, i would like to hear your suggestions. one idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a \"forward commitment\" in order to reduce the equity required. i would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. i could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. i am faxing you a project summary. and i will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you. let me know what else you need. the land is scheduled to close mid january. phillip allen jeff, everything should be done for closing on the leander deal on the 29th. i have fed ex\\'d the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow. when will more money be required? escrow for roads? utility connections? other rezoning costs? what about property taxes? the burnet land lost its ag exemption while i owned it. are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property? can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned? do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? what are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing? i am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and american multifamily walking on this deal. so i just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can. phillip steve, i am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. if you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. as far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. examine ldc\\'s incentive rate program. current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. the result is that the ldc\\'s sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. this creates a shortage in later months. 2. california has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. investigate why it wasn\\'t maximized operationally. specific questions should include: 1. why in march \\'00-may \\'00 weren\\'t total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. why are there so many examples of ofo\\'s on weekends that push away too much gas from socal\\'s system. i believe socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. they repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. not enough forward hedging is done by the major ldcs. by design the customers are short at a floating rate. this market has been long historically. it has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. call me if you need any more input. phillip lucy, here is a rentroll for this week. the one you sent for 11/24 looked good. it seems like most people are paying on time. did you rent an efficiency to the elderly woman on a fixed income? go ahead a use your judgement on the rent prices for the vacant units. if you need to lower the rent by $10 or $20 to get things full, go ahead. i will be out of the office on thursday. i will talk to you on friday. phillip monique sanchez jay reitmeyer randy gay matt lenhart john, here is our north of stanfield forecast for jan. supply jan

<retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net> cc: subject: sm134 proforma.xls enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser. note that the construction management fee (cmf) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%. this will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity. also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high. therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as the met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or cmf, which is $54-55 with cmf. it appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876. however, i am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5mm. i hope to finish the proforma today. the rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ada units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom. additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month. - winmail.dat ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 11/16/2000 02:51 pm --------------------------- to: faith killen/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: re: west gas

bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8th deadline due to lack= of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the= bond issuance/bridge loan by the may 8th deadline. any possibility for a= deal has reportedly fallen apart. according to sources, both the republic= ans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis. the democratic cauc= us is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for davis. many legislative republic= ans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that, o= nce the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund, davis would \"double= dip\" into the fund. clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg= islature and the governor. however, it is believed once davis discloses th= e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac= e. additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon= g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t= hat the bond issuance happen by july 1, 2001. if not, the state may be in = breach of contract. sources state that if the legislature does not pass th= e bridge loan legislation by may 8th, having a bond issuance by july 1st wi= ll be very difficult. the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat= e would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general= fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately = $8 billion. however, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this = concession. sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for ful= l disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the = details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they= will support the bond issuance to go forward. currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan; ab 8x and ab = 31x. ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. this bi= ll passed the senate in march, but has stalled in the assembly due to a lac= k of republican support. ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs fo= r community college districts. however, sources report this bill may be am= ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen, curre= ntly in ab 8x. senator bowen\\'s language states that the state should get = paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li= kely to cause a socal bankruptcy).=20 =20 according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature, republic= ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in = the general fund. for instance, tony strickland has stated that only 1/2 = of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion) should be issued. other republ= icans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. the republicans intend= to bring this up in debate on monday. additionally, lehman brothers repo= rtedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind= ications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan. =20 key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount:=09$4.125 b lenders:=09=09jp morgan=09=09$2.5 b =09=09=09lehman brothers=09=09$1.0 b =09=09=09bear stearns=09=09$625 m tax exempt portion:=09of the $4.125 b; $1.6 b is expected to be tax-exempt projected interest

bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday, but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday, which authorizes $5 billion to create t= he california consumer power and conservation authority. the $5 billion= authorized under sb 6x is not the same as the $5 billion that must be aut= horized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the addi= tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power = going forward. again, the republicans are not in support of these authoriz= ations. without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor = has negotiated, the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is = that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support. no f= urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6x until it = is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchas= ing power. also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for the calif= ornia public power and conservation authority. however, this can be consi= dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea earl= ier in the crisis. =20 socal edison and bankruptcy at this point, two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy. t= he first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the = governor. the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is au= gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. according t= o sources, the state has yet to sign the mou with socal, though socal has s= igned it. the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davi= s and the senate lack the votes needed to pass. if the legislature indicat= es that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary bank= ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20 the second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is= suance, would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x (bridge loan) s= tating that the dwr would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th= en the utilities would receive the residual amount. in other words, the st= ate will get paid before the utilities. if this language is included and p= assed by the legislature, it appears likely that socal will likely file for= bankruptcy. socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and= the dwr proportionately from rate payments. ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 11/01/2000 11:33 am --------------------------- jeff richter

attractive. i have one other investor in addition to keith that has interest. some additional background information on larry and yourself would be helpful. background questions: please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in creekside. please list projects completed during the last 5 years. include the project description, investors, business entity, please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. with regard to the proposed investment structure, i would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between creekside and the investors. preferable investment structure: developers guarantee note, not investors. preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. builder assumes some risk for cost overruns. since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now. these questions are not intended to be offensive in any way. it is my desire to build a successful project with creekside that leads to future opportunities. i am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or keith as a business partner. sincerely, phillip allen bob, patti sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while randy gay was on a personal leave. she displayed a tremendous amount of commitment to the west desk during that time. she frequently came to work before 4 am to prepare operations reports. patti worked 7 days a week during this time. if long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on patti. she didn\\'t crack and provided much needed info during this time. patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. specialist. based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a pbr. let me know what is an acceptable cash amount. phillip andy,

\"george richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 09/26/2000 01:18:45 pm please respond to <cbpres@austin.rr.com> to: \"phillip allen\" <pallen@enron.com> cc: \"larry lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, \"claudia l. crocker\" <clclegal2@aol.com> subject: investment structure structure: typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or llc) general partner. the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. land ownership & loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits is reduced. all loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc. these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. early land costs the $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\". this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa. this release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. as such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. the lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. this would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. phasing works as follows. if the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. this would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. construction loans there are three types of construction loans. first, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. second, is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will be from 80% to 95% of value. disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. these fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. finally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. at present cb does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. what did you have in mind? i would like to use some form of internet based reporting. bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\" please expand. investor input we are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials. as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus. as you, and i presume keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. pre-selected professionals, subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested. i know i have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. sincerely, george richards president, creekside builders, llc - winmail.dat bob, regarding patti sullivan\\'s contributions to the west desk this year, her efforts deserve recognition and a pbr award. patti stepped up to fill the gap left by randy gay\\'s personal leave. patti held together the scheduling group for about 2

angeles, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- u.s. western spot power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather across the region and declining natural gas prices. according to belton, missouri-based weather derivatives inc., temperatures in the pacific northwest will average about 2 degrees fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. in the southwest temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal. at the california-oregon border, heavy load power fell $172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00. \"what happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were supposed to have,\\'\\' said one northwest power marketer. since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.\" temperatures in los angeles today will peak at 66 degrees, and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend. natural gas to be delivered to the california oregon from the el paso pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday. \"gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices to fall,\\'\\' said one northwest power trader. at the np-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased $206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. light load energy fell to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday. psc of new mexico\\'s 498-megawatt san juan unit 4 coal plant was shut down this morning for a tube leak. the unit is scheduled to restart this weekend. at the four corners located in new mexico, power traded at $325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday. -robert scalabrino pjm spot power prices dip with weather, falling natural gas philadelphia, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- peak next-day power prices declined at the western hub of the pennsylvania-new jersey-maryland interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and falling natural gas prices, traders said. the bloomberg index price for peak thursday power at western pjm declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $62.00-$76.00. lexington, massachusetts-based weather services corp. forecast tomorrow\\'s high temperature in philadelphia at 40 degrees fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today\\'s expected high. temperatures could climb as high as 42 degrees by friday. \"most of the day\\'s activity took place in the early part of the morning,\" said one pjm-based trader. \"by options expiration the market had pretty much dried up.\" traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main reason for the decline in spot market prices. bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the new york city gate declined an average of $1.25 per million british thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million btu. since monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of $2.44 per million btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts indicated reduced utility load requirements. in new york, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets. peak next-day power at the zone a delivery point sold $6.13 higher at a bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the $67.00-$75.00 range. power at zone j sold $7.50 higher at $90.00- $92.00. ~ -karyn rispoli mid-continent power prices drop on revised forecast, gas prices cincinnati, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- u.s. mid-continent next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said. the bloomberg index price for peak thursday power on the cincinnati-based cinergy corp. transmission system dropped $23.19 to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the market opened down to $59.00 after options expired. in mid-america interconnected network trading, peak power on the chicago-based commonwealth edison co. grid sold $21.37 lower on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower main sold $18.17 lower at $65.00-$100.00. belton, missouri-based weather derivatives inc. predicted high temperatures would average 2 degrees fahrenheit above normal in chicago and at normal levels in cincinnati over the next seven days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal monday, respectively. traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down. natural gas prices were a large factor in recent electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired generation to meet increased weather-related demand. spot natural gas at the cincinnati city gate sold an average of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million british thermal units. spot gas at the chicago city gate sold an average of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million btu. \"the weather\\'s moderating and gas is down, so you\\'ve got people coming to their senses,\" one trader said. \"these are much more realistic prices.\" traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the outlook for weather continues to be mild. peak cinergy power for delivery from dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00 yesterday. mid-continent area power pool peak spot power prices plunged with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern mapp and $44.17 less in southern mapp at $75.00-$125.00. \"what\\'s happening is the people who don\\'t have firm transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those high prices since they have no choice,\" one mapp trader said. \"then you\\'ve got some people who were lucky enough to get a firm path who waited until later in the morning when comed prices fell off,\" he said, \"and bought from them at those lower prices, causing the huge gap between the day\\'s high and low trade.\" -ken fahnestock southeast u.s. electricity prices slump after mild forecast atlanta, georgia, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- southeast u.s. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was forecast for the region this week, traders said. traders said southeast utility demand has been reduced since many large population centers like atlanta will see temperatures climb into the mid-50s fahrenheit later this week. \"there was nothing going on in florida today,\" said one southern energy trader. \"everything was going to markets in the north.\" traders said supply was being routed from florida into markets on the entergy corp. and the tennessee valley authority grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour. \"prices into tva started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out,\" said on entergy power trader. \"prices, declined to $60 and less.\" the bloomberg into tva index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates. southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region. in the southwest power pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices. \"the cold weather\\'s backing off,\" said one spp utility trader. \"it was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it\\'s about 9 degrees with the wind chill. yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.\" power sold in northern sections of spp at $78-$100, though the bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. southern spp traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday. -brian whary u.k. day-ahead electricity prices rise amid increased demand london, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- electricity prices in the u.k. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said. the day-ahead baseload pool purchase price, calculated by the electricity pool of england and wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour. temperatures across the u.k. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees celsius by the weekend, according to weather services corp. in the u.s. day-ahead electricity forward agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday. december continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said. december 2000 baseload efas traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday\\'s last trade. first quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said. january 2001 baseload efas dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence. first quarter 2001 baseload efas traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close. season structures traded on the u.k. power exchange, summer 2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour. winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour. open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to christmas, traders said. adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed. -nick livingstone nordic electricity prices climb following cold weather forecast lysaker, norway, dec. 13 (bloomberg energy) -- power prices on the nord pool exchange in lysaker, norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said. week 51 dealt between 145-152 norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday\\'s closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over scandinavia for next week. these producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing. consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating. traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said. \"the market\\'s been waiting for this day for a long time,\" a stockholm-based trader said. \"for too long, people have been selling because winter hasn\\'t lived up to expectations. we should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\" temperatures in parts of scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to weather services corp. in the u.s. the day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling. thursday\\'s system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts. many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week. winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts. winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday\\'s last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. also, the delayed restart at a swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said. vattenfall\\'s ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said. today\\'s rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today\\'s news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said. -nick livingstone -0- (bes) dec/13/2000 21:04 gmt =0f$ - daily.pdf

site from investor\\'s alliance. investor\\'s alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on san marcos that you received earlier. if there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. then, let me know your interest level in the westgate project? san marcos the property across the street from the sagewood units in san marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units. the land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in west san marcos, which now has a moratorium on development. several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. this property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now. if this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity. the equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land. i will know more on this question later today. sincerely, george w. richards president, creekside builders, llc - winmail.dat ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on

10:56 am liane, as we discussed yesterday, i am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the el paso san juan monthly index. it appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for san juan gas. at the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan. we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27. these are the complete list of trades from enron online (eol), enron\\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (amerex, apb, and prebon). please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships. the two key points from this data are as follows: 1. the high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. the spread relationship between san juan and other points (socal & northwest) is consistent between the end of september and october gas daily. it doesn\\'t make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different. i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers. hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70\\'s and these trades are outliers. i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index. it is enron\\'s belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business. please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal. sincerely, phillip allen liane, as we discussed yesterday, i am concerned there has

partner. the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. land ownership & loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits is reduced. all loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc. these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. early land costs the $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\". this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa. this release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. as such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. the lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. this would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. phasing works as follows. if the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. this would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. construction loans there are three types of construction loans. first, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. second, is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will be from 80% to 95% of value. disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. these fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. finally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. at present cb does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. what did you have in mind? i would like to use some form of internet based reporting. bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\" please expand. investor input we are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials. as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus. as you, and i presume keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. pre-selected professionals, subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested. i know i have not answered everything, but this

<phillip.k.allen@enron.com> subject: closing jeff, ? is the closing today?? after reviewing the agreement?i find it isn\\'t binding as far as i can determine.? it is too vague and it doesn\\'t sound like anything an attorney or title company would?draft for a real estate closing--but, of course, i could be wrong.? ? if this?closing is going to take place without this agreement then there is no point in me following up on this?document\\'s validity.? ? i will just need to go back to my closing documents and see what\\'s there and find out where i am with that and deal with this as best i can. ? i guess i was expecting something that would be an exhibit to a recordable document or something a little more exact, or rather?sort of a contract.? this isn\\'t either.? i tried to get a real estate atty on the phone last night but he was out of pocket.? i talked to a crim. atty friend and he said this is out of his area but doesn\\'t sound binding to him.? ? i will go back to mine and phillip allen\\'s transaction?and take a look at that but as vague and general as this is i doubt that my signature? is even needed to complete this transaction.? i am in after 12 noon if there is any need to contact me regarding the closing. ? i really do not want to hold up anything or generate more work for myself and i don\\'t want to insult or annoy anyone but this paper really doesn\\'t seem to be something required for a closing.? in the event you do need my signature on something like this i would rather have time to have it reviewed before i accept it. ? brenda ? ? chris, what is the latest with pg&e? we have been having good discussions regarding eol. call me when you can. x37041 phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 09/25/2000 02:01 pm

can you please relay the information to mike grigsby at 37031 so he can pass it along to the user at gas daily today. i will be out of the office on friday. thank you phillip john, denver\\'s short rockies position beyond 2002 is created by their trailblazer transport. they are unhedged 15,000/d in 2003 and 25,000/d in 2004 and 2005. they are scrubbing all their books and booking the hubert deal on wednesday and thursday. phillip george, below is a list of questions that keith and i had regarding the westgate project: ownership structure what will be the ownership structure? limited partnership? general partner? what are all the legal entities that will be involved and in what capacity(regarding ownership and liabilities)? who owns the land? improvements? who holds the various loans? is the land collateral? investment what happens to initial investment? is it used to purchase land for cash?secure future loans? why is the land cost spread out on the cash flow statement? when is the 700,000 actually needed? now or for the land closing? investment schedule? investment return is equity repayment the return of the original investment? is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits are distributed? debt which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral is associated with each loan? improvement construction are these the only two loans? looks like it from the cash flow statement. terms of each loan? uses of funds how will disbursements be made? by whom? what type of bank account? controls on max disbursement? internet viewing for investors? reports to track expenses vs plan? bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses? what is the relationship of creekside builders to the project? do you get paid a markup on subcontractors as a general contractor and paid gain out of profits? do you or larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses before the ultimate payout of profits? design and construction when will design be complete? what input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units? what level of investor involvement will be possible during construction planning and permitting? does creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, vendors, and other professionals? such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking? are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to use? names? these questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor in a project like this it is new to me. also, i want to learn as much as possible from the process. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 09/19/2000 04:35 pm --------------------------- \"george richards\"

proforma-phillip allen.xls enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the westgate property is austin that we told you about. as you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. this is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market. this is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the austin market. the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. as it is in the \"smart growth corridor\" area designated by the city of austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months. additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived. i have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in north austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening. even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, i used this data to be cautious. the lone star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly. other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at st. edwards university. as with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven. we have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on westgate and cameron loop. gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. the seller accepted our offer thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow. this will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an a&d loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. this analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project. as we discussed in san marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot. i believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project. you would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first. larry lewter knows an expert in the field in san antonio if you do not know anyone. i will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by airborne express today for saturday delivery. once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area. please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time. you can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. my cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103. i look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. i regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks. a small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the south part of austin where we are building 10 town homes. one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day. the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down. the city shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract. then last week i had to take my wife to emergency. she has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week.. there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday. fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. george w. richards creekside builders, llc - westgate proforma-phillip allen.xls george, here sales numbers from reagan: as you can see his units sold at a variety of prices per square foot. the 1308/1308 model seems to have the most data and looks most similiar to the units you are selling. at 2.7 mm, my bid is .70/sf higher than his units under construction. i am having a hard time justifying paying much more with competition on the way. the price i am bidding is higher than any deals actually done to date. let me know what you think. i will follow up with an email and phone call about cherry creek. i am sure deborah yates let you know that the bid was rejected on the de ville property. phillip allen jeff, what is up with burnet? phillip jeff, i need to see the site plan for burnet. remember i must get written approval from brenda key stone before i can sell this property and she has concerns about the way the property will be subdivided. i would also like to review the closing statements as soon as possible. phillip lucy, i want to have an accurate rent roll as soon as possible. i faxed you a copy of this file. you can fill in on the computer or just write in the correct amounts and i will input. brenda, i checked my records and i mailed check #1178 for the normal amount on august 28th. i mailed it to 4303 pate rd. #29, college station, tx 77845. i will go ahead and mail you another check. if the first one shows up you can treat the 2nd as payment for october. i know your concerns about the site plan. i will not proceed without getting the details and getting your approval. i will find that amortization schedule and send it soon. phillip lucy, you wrote fewer checks this month. spent more money on materials and less on labor. june july august total materials 2929 4085 4801 services 53 581 464 labor 3187 3428 2770 here are my questions on the august bank statement (attached): 1. check 1406

proforma-phillip allen.xls jeff, i received the rent roll. i am going to be in san marcos this weekend but i am booked with stage coach. i will drive by friday evening. i will let you know next week if i need to see the inside. can you find out when chelsea villa last changed hands and for what price? what about getting a look at the site plans for the burnet deal. remember we have to get brenda happy. phillip 9/8 9/7 diff socal 36,600 37,200 -600 nwpl -51,000 -51,250 250 san juan -32,500 -32,000 -500 the reason the benchmark report shows net selling san juan is that the transport positions were rolled in on 9/8. this added 800 shorts to san juan and 200 longs to socal. before this adjustment we bought 300 san juan and sold 800 socal. why is aeco basis so low on the list? is nwpl mapped differently than aeco? what about the correlation to nymex on aeco? jeff, you would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood. i am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which i might become involved with creekside. are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts? is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue? did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch? i am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet. phillip transwestern pipeline co. posted new notice(s) since our last check at

sagewood town homes i was aware that regan lehman, the lot developer for the entire 70 lot duplex project, was selling his units in the $180\\'s, he does have a much lower basis in the lots than anyone else, but the prime differences are due to a) he is selling them during construction and b) they are smaller units. we do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. this would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. (i thought his sales price was $187,000.) at this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. what is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability. you have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation. as for rent-ability, i believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. in fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. phillip, i will call you today to go over this more thoroughly. sincerely, george w. richards

a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development opportunities. i stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street. that were built by reagan lehmann. 22 units were sold for around $2 million. ($182,000/duplex). i spoke to reagan and he indicated that he had more units under construction that would be available in the 180\\'s. are the units he is selling significantly different from yours? he mentioned some of the units are the 1308 floor plan. my bid of 2.7 million is almost $193,000/duplex. as far as being an investor in a new project, i am still very interested. call or email with

these loads at the distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for power quality reasons. the city of austin, tx has experienced 300+ mw of load growth this year due to server farms and technology companies. there is a 100 mw server farm trying to hook up to hl&p as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months due to distribution infrastructure issues. obviously, seattle, porltand, boise, denver, san fran and san jose in your markets are in for a rude awakening in the next 2-3 years. ---------------------- forwarded by kevin m presto/hou/ect on 09/05/2000

suarez/hou/ect@ect, suresh vasan/enron communications@enron communications@enron cc: subject: internet data gain is a major power drain on local utilities ( september 05, 2000 ) in 1997, a little-known silicon valley company called exodus communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in tukwila. the mission was to handle the internet traffic and computer servers for the region\\'s growing number of dot-coms. fast-forward to summer 2000. exodus is now wrapping up construction on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than a mile from its original facility. sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones, the exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually house internet servers for firms such as avenue a, microsoft and onvia.com. exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near seattle. more than a dozen companies -- with names like abovenet, globix and hostpro -- are looking for facilities here that will house the networking equipment of the internet economy. it is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite web sites. data centers, also known as co-location facilities and server farms, are sprouting at such a furious pace in tukwila and the kent valley that some have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and puget sound energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, high-security facilities. \"we are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting 445 megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall,\" said karl karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for puget sound energy. \"that is the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, the rise of the internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads. puget sound energy last week asked the washington utilities and transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers. the tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects. those base stations could cost as much as $20 million each, karzmar said. not to be left behind, seattle city light plans to bring up the data center issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting. for the utilities that provide power to homes, businesses and schools in the region, this is a new and complex issue. on one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing appetite for power -- represent potentially lucrative business customers. the facilities run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a constant revenue stream. on the other hand, they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures. who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates in the area is still open to debate. \"these facilities are what we call extremely dense loads,\" said bob royer, director of communications and public affairs at seattle city light. \"the entire university of washington, from stadium lights at the football game to the medical school, averages 31 megawatts per day. we have data center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 and 50 megawatts.\" with more than 1.5 million square feet, the intergate complex in tukwila is one of the biggest data centers. sabey corp. re-purchased the 1.35 million square-foot intergate east facility last september from boeing space & defense. in less than 12 months, the developer has leased 92 percent of the six-building complex to seven different co-location companies. \"it is probably the largest data center park in the country,\" boasts laurent poole, chief operating officer at sabey. exodus, icg communications, netstream communications, pac west telecomm and zama networks all lease space in the office park. after building exodus\\' first tukwila facility in 1997, sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in los angeles, spokane and denver. poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of internet data centers in the country. as more people access the internet and conduct bandwidth-heavy tasks such as listening to online music, poole said the need for co-location space in seattle continues to escalate. but it is not just seattle. the need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as texas and california. exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location space, plans to nearly double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. while companies such as amazon.com run their own server farms, many high-tech companies have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as exodus that may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic management. \"we have 2 million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more demand right now than data center space,\" said steve porter, an account executive at exodus in seattle. the booming market for co-location space has left some in the local utility industry perplexed. \"it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth,\" said seattle city light\\'s royer. \"the utility industry is almost stunned by this, in a way.\" ina, can you pull tori k.\\'s and martin cuilla\\'s resumes and past performance reviews from h.r. ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k

but i want to get the exact details from him. basically, they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider. then once their sales are large enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. the risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk. this is my best guess. i will get back to you with more. phillip lucy, i want to speak to wade myself. he can call me at work or home. or if you email me his number i will call him. i would like gary to direct wade on renovation tasks and you

allen/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: thoughts on presentation it is a shame that the caiso doesn\\'t provide actual generation by unit. the wscc data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until july 1999, and the cemms, which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. for your purposes the caiso may suffice. i think that you probably know this already, but there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" generation. you are pulling \"scheduled.\" if someone doesn\\'t schedule their generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you will miss that. you may also miss generation of the northern california munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. that is, if they have 1500 mw of load and 1200 mw of generation, they may simply schedule 300 mw of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 mw. having said all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side. on the load side i think that i would simply use caiso actual load. while they don\\'t split out np15 from sp15, i think that using the actual number is better than the \"scheduled\" number. the utilities play lots of game on the load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price. i think the presentation looks good. it would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished. i\\'d like to see how much gas demand goes up with each additional gw of gas-generated electricity, especially compared to all gas consumption. i was surprised by how small the ueg consumption was compared

(if the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your overall p&l.) maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects something else somewhere that i am not seeing, but anyway, here are the deal #\\'s, paths and p&l impacts of each. 139195 from kingsgate to malin ($182,030) 139196 from kingsgate to pgen/tuscarora ($ 4,024) 139197 from kingsgate to pgen malin ($ 8,271) 231321 from kingsgate to malin ($ 38,705) 153771 from kingsgate to stanfield ($ 1,988) suggested fix: change pgen kingsgate mapping from gdp-malin citygate to gdp-kingsgate. clay basin storage--this is really a fyi more than anything else--i see five different tickets in sitara for clay basin activity--one appears to be for withdrawals and the other four are injections. clay basin is valued as a questar curve, which is substantially below nwpl points. what this means is that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. i\\'m not sure of the best way to handle this since we don\\'t really have a systematic sitara way of handling storage deals. in an ideal world, it seems that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. anyway, here\\'s the detail on the tickets just for your info, plus i noticed three days where it appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from clay basin. there may be an operational reason why this occurred that i\\'m not aware of, and the dollar impact is very small, but i thought i\\'d bring it to your attention just in case there\\'s something you want to do about it. the columns below show the volumes under each ticket and the p&l associated with each. deal # 251327 159540 265229 106300 201756 p&l $29,503 ($15,960) ($3,199) ($2,769) ($273) rec: ques/clay basin/0184 nwpl/opal 543 nwpl/opal sumas nwpl/s of gr rvr del: nwpl/s of green river/clay ques/clay basin/0852 ques/clay basin/0852 ques/clay basin ques/clay basin 1 329 8,738 2 1,500 3 2,974 11,362 4 6,741 12,349 1,439 5 19,052 3,183 9 333 13 30,863 2,680 14 30,451 15 35,226 16 6,979 235 17 17,464 18 9,294 20 10,796 771 21 17,930 22 10,667 23 14,415 9,076 25 23,934 8,695 26 3,284 27 1,976 28 1,751 29 1,591 30 20,242 mary, if we add both balances together the total is $1,140. i can spread it over 6 or 12 months. 6 month payout would be $190/month. 12 month payout would be $95/month. your choice. i would like it if you could work 5/hrs each friday for another month or so. does $10/hr sound fair? we can apply it to the loan. phillip address: id: pallen password: westgasx lucy, i am going to be in seguin this saturday through monday. we can talk about a unit for wade then. i will call the bank again today to resolve authorization on the account. lets keep the office open until noon on memorial day. philllip lucy, did you get set up on the checking account? try and email me every day with a note about what happened that day. just info about new vacancies or tenants and which apartments you and wade worked on each day. phillip this note is authorization to make the following changes: 1. set up a new book for frank ermis-nw basis 2. route these products to nw basis: nwpl rkymtn malin pg&e citygate 3. route epng permian to todd richardson\\'s book ft-new texas call with questions. x37041 thank you, phillip allen ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 05/22/2000 11:43 am --------------------------- \"capacitycenter.com\" on 05/18/2000 02:55:43 pm to: cc: subject: gas transportation market intelligence [image] natural gas transporation contract information and pipeline notices delivered to your desktop http://www.capacitycenter.com [image] [image] [image] [image] [image] [image] [image] [image] [image] [image] register now and sign up for a free trial through the end of may bid week capacity shopper: learn about capacity release that is posted to bid. pick up some transport at a good price or explore what releases are out there....it can affect gas prices! daily activity reports: check out the deals that were done! what did your competitors pick up, and how do their deals match up against yours? this offers you better market intelligence! system notices: have system notices delivered to your desk. don\\'t be the last one to learn about an ofo because you were busy doing something else!

are there any services we provide? how much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? who are your main contacts at sw gas? we will propose to provide a full requirements supply to sw involving our control of their assets. for this to be attractive to sw, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. this will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. that risk may not be acceptable to the desk. i will do some investigation of their pga\\'s and see if there is an opportunity. as to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? are there elements that you would like to see? any ideas at all would be greatly appreciated. thanks, laird kay & neal, thanks for remembering my birthday. you beat my parents by one day. the family is doing fine. grace is really smiling. she is a very happy baby as long as she is being held. it sounds like your house is coming along fast. i think my folks are ready to start building. we will probably visit in late june or july. may is busy. we are taking the kids to disney for their birthdays. good luck on the house. keith ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 04/26/2000 08:40 am --------------------------- tim heizenrader 04/25/2000 11:43 am to: jim fallon/hou/ect@ect, phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: tim belden/hou/ect@ect subject: western strategy session materials today\\'s charts are attached: ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 04/26/2000 08:36 am --------------------------- tim heizenrader 04/25/2000 11:43 am to: jim fallon/hou/ect@ect, phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: tim belden/hou/ect@ect subject: western strategy session materials today\\'s charts are attached: 2000-1969=31 ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 12/13/2000 11:28 am --------------------------- from: sarah novosel@enron on 12/13/2000 10:17 am cst to: james d steffes/na/enron@enron, joe hartsoe/corp/enron@enron, susan j mara/na/enron@enron, jeff dasovich/na/enron@enron, richard shapiro/na/enron@enron, steven j kean/na/enron@enron, richard b sanders/hou/ect@ect, stephanie miller/corp/enron@enron, christi l nicolay/hou/ect@ect, mary hain/hou/ect@ect, pkaufma@enron.com, pallen@enron.com cc: subject: enron response to san diego request for gas price caps please review the attached draft enron comments in response to the san diego request for natural gas price caps. the comments reflect becky cantrell\\'s comments (which are reflected in red line). please respond to me as soon as possible with your comments, and please pass it on to anyone else who needs to see it. thanks sarah mary, i spoke to gary about the foundation work on #2 & #3. he agreed that it would be better to just clean up #3 and do whatever he and wade can do to #2. then they can just focus on #19. i worked on the books this weekend but i need more time to finish. i will call you in a day or so. phillip here is my dsl form. thanks for your help. my assistant is ina rangel. ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 04/10/2000 02:09 pm --------------------------- from: julie a gomez 04/01/2000 07:11 am to: hunter s shively/hou/ect@ect, phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: alliance netback worksheet hello men- i have attached my worksheet in case you want to review the data while i am on holiday. thanks, julie :-) ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 04/06/2000 12:18 pm --------------------------- from: julie a gomez 04/01/2000 07:11 am to: hunter s shively/hou/ect@ect, phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: alliance netback worksheet hello men- i have attached my worksheet in case you want to review the data while i am on holiday. thanks, julie :-) beth, here are our addresses for dsl lines: hunter shively 10545 gawain houston, tx 77024 713 461-4130 phillip allen 8855 merlin ct houston, tx 77055 713 463-8626 mike grigsby 6201 meadow lake houston, tx 77057 713 780-1022 thanks phillip are we going to inspect tomorrow?

may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- most western u.s. spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply outstripped demand. at the sp-15 delivery point in southern california, peak power dropped $186.88 to a bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt- hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range. \"air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing prices to decline,\" said one southwest trader. according to weather services corp., of lexington massachusetts, temperatures in los angeles were expected to reach 75 degrees fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight. at the palo verde switchyard in arizona, peak power sank $202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a bloomberg index of $220.48 as traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range. traders said that arizona\\'s public service co. 1,270-megawatt palo verde-1 nuclear plant in wintersburg, arizona, increased production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage that began march 31. at the mid-columbia trading point in washington, peak power slumped 47.5 percent from friday\\'s sunday-monday package to a bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00. according to belton, missouri-based weather derivatives inc., temperatures in the pacific northwest will average 1.2 degrees fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling demand 84 percent below normal. \"we are expecting rain in the pacific northwest which is causing temperatures to drop,\" said one northwest trader. at the np-15 delivery point in northern california, peak power fell $189.39 to a bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at $175.00-$228.00. according the california independent system operator today\\'s forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743 megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts. -robert scalabrino northeast power prices fall with more generation, less demand philadelphia, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- an increase in available generation coupled with less weather-related demand, caused next-day power prices in the northeast u.s. to fall as much as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said. according to weather derivatives corp. of belton, missouri, temperatures in the northeast will average within one degree fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively. in the pennsylvania-new jersey-maryland interconnection, peak power scheduled for tuesday delivery was assessed at a bloomberg volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from friday. \"there\\'s just no weather out there,\" said one pjm-based trader. \"there\\'s no need for air conditioning, and no need for heating. as far as i can tell, it\\'s going to be that way all week long.\" peak loads in pjm are projected to average less than 30,000 megawatts through friday. traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for the dip. interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to hit the grid tomorrow. next-day prices fell across all three zones of the new york power pool, with increased output at the nine mile point 1 and 2 nuclear power facilities. the nuclear regulator commission reported nine mile point 1 at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt nine mile point 2 at full power following unplanned maintenance. both units are owned and operated by niagara mohawk. zone j, which comprises new york city, slipped $4.50 to $58.50, while zones g and a fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to $51.25 and $40.00 indices. ~ -karyn rispoli weather-related demand drives mid-continent power prices up cincinnati, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the mid-continent u.s. as high weather-related demand was expected in the midwest and southeast, traders said. \"it\\'s supposed to be pretty warm in the tva (tennessee valley authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from cinergy to there,\" one east central area reliability council trader said. \"dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of that.\" the bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered tuesday into the cincinnati-based cinergy corp. transmission system rose $3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25 when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired. cinergy power for wednesday-friday delivery sold at $39.00 and power for may 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the southeast was expected to remain high into next week. next-day power in tva sold $2.15 higher on average at $28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in nashville, tennessee, forecast at 87 degrees fahrenheit through thursday. \"things should continue along these lines for the rest of the week, because there\\'s enough power to get down there but not so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,\" an ecar trader said. in mid-america interconnected network trading, demand from the cinergy hub and the entergy corp. grid pulled prices up, though traders said transmission problems limited volume. peak monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the chicago-based commonwealth edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50, and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with trades from $32.00-$40.00. mid-continent area power pool peak spot power prices also climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs. for-tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern mapp at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern half of the region at $45.00-$52.00. lexington, massachusetts-based weather services corp. predicted tomorrow\\'s high temperature would be 85 degrees in minneapolis and 91 degrees in omaha, nebraska. \"there\\'s no available transmission from comed, and problems getting power out of ameren\\'s grid too,\" one mapp trader said. \"it\\'s likely to cause problems all week, since it\\'s hot here and down in spp (the southwest power pool).\" -ken fahnestock southeast power prices mixed as southern markets heat up atlanta, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- u.s. southeast spot electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to major southern u.s. population centers, traders said. forecasters from lexington, massachusetts-based weather services corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the atlanta vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees fahrenheit, 5 degrees higher than today\\'s projected high. cooler weather is expected to begin wednesday. conversely, in the nashville, tennessee, vicinity, temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week, propelling air conditioning demand, traders said. the bloomberg southeast electric reliability council regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from equivalent trades made friday for delivery today, to $37.20. trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50. on the tennessee valley authority grid, power traded an average of $2.15 higher at a bloomberg index of $34.44 amid trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range. in texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for ub firm energy to a bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000. \"there\\'s just no overnight load to do anything with the supply we have,\" said one texas-based utility power trader. \"last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree (fahrenheit) days. this year so far, the highest we\\'ve seen is 85 degrees, so that\\'s about 10 degrees below normal for us.\" on the entergy corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done at a bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than friday. traders said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the south starting wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at $35-$36. traders said southern co. was purchasing day-ahead energy at $37 from utilities in the virginia-carolinas region because power from vacar was cheaper than from utilities in serc. southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a bloomberg index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range. in the forward power markets, entergy power for the balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later trades were noted as high as $48.75. balance-of-may entergy power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders said. on the tva grid, power for the balance of this week was bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. firm energy for the balance of may was discussed at $41, though no new trades were noted. -brian whary u.k. power prices fall as offers continue to outweigh bids london, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- power prices in the u.k. fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling interest, traders said. winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than friday. the contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was short. volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting price levels, traders said. shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said. june baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from friday after last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour. on the international petroleum exchange, june natural gas futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15 pence a thermal unit. the contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since the start of last week. some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements. most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels, they said. -amal halawi nordic power soars in active trade on renewed buying interest lysaker, norway, may 14 (bloomberg energy) -- longer-term electricity prices on the nordic power exchange in lysaker, norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid limited hydro-supply, traders said. winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 norwegian kroner higher at an all time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00 megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50- 214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour. \"the market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,\\'\\' an oslo- based trader said. \"i\\'m surprised that even at the peak of the snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are steadily climbing.\\'\\' precipitation across scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent above normal for the next 10 days, according to u.s. forecasters. still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a \"more realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet outlooks.\\'\\' tuesday\\'s system area average price was set below expecations of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour, down 7.45 kroner from today\\'s price. still, traders said this was a \"high\\'\\' spot price for this time of the year. week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour with 140 megawatts exchanged. trade volumes on nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours generation, up 368 percent from friday\\'s 1,169 gigawatt-hours. -alejandro barbajosa -0- (bes) may/14/2001 19:33 gmt =0f$ - daily.pdf phillip, i am

lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance/bridge loan by the may 8th deadline. any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart. according to sources, both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis. the democratic caucus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for davis. many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund, davis would \"double dip\" into the fund. clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor. however, it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1, 2001. if not, the state may be in breach of contract. sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8th, having a bond issuance by july 1st will be very difficult. the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion. however, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession. sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward. currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan; ab 8x and ab 31x. ab 8x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. this bill passed the senate in march, but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support. ab 31x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts. however, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen, currently in ab 8x. senator bowen\\'s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy). according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature, republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund. for instance, tony strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion) should be issued. other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday. additionally, lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan. key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount: $4.125 b lenders: jp morgan $2.5 b lehman brothers $1.0 b bear stearns $625 m tax exempt portion: of the $4.125 b; $1.6 b is expected to be tax-exempt projected interest rate: taxable rate 5.77% tax-exempt rate 4.77% current projected blended ir: 5.38% maturity date: august 29, 2001 for more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510 bill sb 6x passed the senate yesterday, but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb 6x yesterday, which authorizes $5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority. the $5 billion authorized under sb 6x is not the same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward. again, the republicans are not in support of these authorizations. without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has negotiated, the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support. no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power. also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for the california public power and conservation authority. however, this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis. socal edison and bankruptcy at this point, two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy. the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor. the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. according to sources, the state has yet to sign the mou with socal, though socal has signed it. the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass. if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou, socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. the second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31x (bridge loan) stating that the dwr would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount. in other words, the state will get paid before the utilities. if this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy. socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments. transwestern pipeline co. posted new

a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip. especially if you have to prepare a presentation. i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings. i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary. as far as the business meetings, i think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not. too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn. the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format. my suggestion for where to go is austin. play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski\\'s. flying somewhere takes too much time. tim, mike grigsby is having problems with accessing the west power site. can you please make sure he has an active password. thank you, phillip reagan, just wanted to give you an update. i have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12. kipp flores is working on the construction drawings. at the same time i am pursuing fha financing. once the construction drawings are complete i will send them to you for a revised bid. your original bid was competitive and i am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts. phillip jim, is there going to be a conference call or some type of weekly meeting about all the regulatory issues facing california this week? can you make sure the gas desk is included. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by

if you have the estimates worked up for johnnie will you please email them to me as well? thank you for your time. i am excited about potentially using your product. phillip allen ray, is there any detail on the gas cost proxy. which delivery points from which publication will be used? basically, can you help us get any clarification on the language \"the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in california\"? phillip ned, regarding the waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value. the following assumptions were made to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/mmbtu variable injection and withdrawal fees. also an undiscounted june 01 to january 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid. bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning june 01 based on above assumptions: $0.05/ mmbtu/month ($0.60/year). demand charges only. i am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not. please call or email with comments. phillip allen ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 04/25/2001 01:51 pm --------------------------- ray alvarez@enron 04/25/2001 11:48 am to: phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: subject: re: this morning\\'s commission meeting delayed phil, i suspect that discussions/negotiations are taking place behind closed doors \"in smoke filled rooms\", if not directly between commissioners then among ferc staffers. never say never, but i think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. i base this belief in large part on what i heard at a luncheon i attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was ferc chairman curt hebert. although the chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the commission, hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps: price caps are almost never the right answer price caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages competitive choices for consumers is the right answer any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable eight out of eleven western governors oppose price caps, in that they would export california\\'s problems to the west this is the latest intelligence i have on the matter, and it\\'s a pretty strong anti- price cap position. of course, hebert is just one commissioner out of 3 currently on the commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda. hope this info helps. ray phillip k allen@ect 04/25/2001 02:28 pm to: ray alvarez/na/enron@enron cc: subject: re: this morning\\'s commission meeting delayed are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?

what are your plans? email me with latest happenings with you in the big city. keith jed, thanks for the response. phillip allen ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 04/09/2001 04:48 pm --------------------------- jed hershey <jhershey@sempratrading.com> on 04/09/2001 02:29:39 pm to: \"\\'pallen@enron.com\\'\" <pallen@enron.com> cc: subject: sanjuan/socal spread prices the following are the prices you requested. unfortunately we are unwilling to transact at these levels due to the current market volatility, but you can consider these accurate market prices: may01-oct01 socal/juan offer: 8.70 usd/mmbtu apr02-oct02 socal/juan offer: 3.53 usd/mmbtu our present value mark to market calculations for these trades are as follows: may01-oct01 30,000/day @ 0.5975 = $44,165,200 apr02-oct02 @ 0.60 = $5,920,980 apr02-oct02 @ 0.745 = $5,637,469 apr02-oct02 @ 0.55 = $3,006,092 if you have any other questions call: (203) 355-5059 jed hershey this e-mail contains privileged attorney-client communications and/or confidential information, and is only for the use by the intended recipient. receipt by an unintended recipient does not constitute a waiver of any applicable privilege. reading, disclosure, discussion, dissemination, distribution or copying of this information by anyone other than the intended recipient or his or her employees or agents is strictly prohibited. if you have received this communication in error, please immediately notify us and delete the original material from your computer. sempra energy trading corp.

my closing has been postponed. as i mentioned i am going to have cary kipp draw the plans for the residence and i will get back in touch with you once he is finished. regarding the multifamily project, i am going to work with a project manager from san antonio. for my first development project, i feel more comfortable with their experience obtaining fha financing. we are working with kipp flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings. your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates. i am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships. i will get back in touch with you once we have made the final determination on unit mix and site plan. phillip allen jacques, the amounts needed to fill in the blanks on exhibit \"b\" are as follows: kipp flores-total contract was $23,600 but $2,375 was paid and only $21,225 is outstanding. kohutek- $2,150 cuatro- $37,800 george & larry paid $3,500 for the appraisal and i agreed to reimburse this amount. the total cash that keith and i will pay the sellers is $5,875 ($3,500 appraisal and $2,375 engineering). i couldn\\'t find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers. let me know if i need to do anything else before you can forward this to the sellers to be executed. phillip john, regarding the employment agreement, mike declined without a counter. keith said he would sign for $75k cash/$250 equity. i still believe frank should receive the same signing incentives as keith. phillip thanks for the response. i think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step. i had already contacted cary kipp and sent him the floor plan. he got back to me yesterday with his first draft. he took my plan and improved it. i am going to officially engage cary to draw the plans. while he works on those i wanted to try and work out a detailed specification list. also, i would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners. i will be in san marcos on friday april 13th. are there any homes near completion that i could walk through that day? also can you provide some references? once i have the plans and specs, i will send them to you so you can adjust your bid. phillip do you have a distribution list to send this to all the traders. phillip

may be reached via email at parking and transportation/corp/enron or 713-853-7060 with any questions. (you must enter & exit on clay st. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of bell & smith.) lucy, here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save. my only questions are: 1. neil moreno in #21-he paid $120 on 11/24, but did not pay anything on 12/01. even if he wants to swich to bi-weekly, he needs to pay at the beginning of the two week period. what is going on? 2. gilbert in #27-is he just late? here is a file for 12/08. https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/ jacques i am out of the office for the rest of the week. have you ever seen anyone miss as much work as i have in the last 6 weeks? i assure you this is unusual for me. hopefully we can sign some documents on monday. call me on my cell phone if you need me. phillip reagan, i am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts. are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap? what role would you play in obtaining financing? any experience with fha 221(d) loans? although your fees are lower than george and larry i am still getting market quotes lower yet. i have received estimates structured as follows: 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment 2%- overhead 4%- profit i just wanted to give you this initial feedback. i have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. as you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. i am not thrilled about such a low return. i think i need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. any ideas? i realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections. i am not discounting those services. i will be out of the office for the rest of the week, but i will call you early next week. phillip cary, here is the picture of the house i have in mind. i was going for a simple farmhouse style to place on 5 acres near wimberley. a few points that might not be obvious from the plans are: there will be a double porch across the back just like the front no dormers (metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs overall dimensions are 55 by 40 what i am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen. more cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. reagan suggested that i find a way to make the exterior more attractive. i want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but i was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. that might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco. also the front porch would be smaller. i have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000. i am ready to go ahead and have the plans done so i can spec out all the finishings and choose a builder. i just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work. as i mentioned my alternative is $0.60/ft. i thought that since i had a such a detailed sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that reagan allowed. phillip allen 713-853-7041 ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k

phillip.k.allen@enron.com cc: subject: no problem reagan, thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence. below is a list of questions on the specs: 1. is the framing lumber #2 yellow pine? wouldn\\'t fir or spruce warp less and cost about the same? 2. what type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory joist? 3. what type for roof framing? on site built rafters? or engineered trusses? 4. are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? what type of insulation in floors and ceiling? batts or blown? fiberglass or cellulose? 5. any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)? 6. did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? i didn\\'t know the difference between an apron and a stool. 7. do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent cracking? double plywood or hardi board underlay? 8. on the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? i was thinking a partial one out of iron. only about 5 feet. 9. i did not label it on the plan, but i was intending for a 1/2 bath under the stairs. a pedestal sink would probably work. 10. are undermount sinks different than drop ins? i was thinking undermount stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths. 11. 1 or 2 a/c units? i am assuming 2. 12. prewired for sound indoors and outdoors? 13. no door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets? 14. exterior porches included in bid? cedar decking on upstairs? iron railings? 15. what type of construction contract would you use? fixed price except for change orders? i want to get painfully detailed with the specs before i make a decision but this is a start. i think i am ready to get plans drawn up. i am going to call cary kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if i like his ideas. phillip i larry, jacques has sent a document to claudia for your review. just dropping you a line to confirm that you have seen it. phillip can you please review the following systems presented in this spreadsheet for your group and let us know if you in fact use all these systems. the west gas includes west gas trading, west gas originations, and the denver piece combined. also, we need for you to give us the breakout for the applicable groups. please let me know if you have any questions. tiffany miller 5-8485 jacques, would it be ok if i signed new consulting agreements with the engineer and architect? they have both sent me agreements. the only payment that george and larry had made was $2,350 to the architect. i have written personal checks in the amounts of $25,000 to the architect and $13,950 to the engineer. i was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership. i would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me. should i wait until the partnership has been conveyed to sign in the name of the partnership. let me know what you think. phillip

here are my comments and questions on the cost estimates: cost per square foot seem too low for construction $33.30/sf (gross)/$36/sf (rentable) what do the cost for on-site general requirements ( $299,818) represent? will you review the builders profit and fees with me again? you mentioned 2% overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit. why is profit only 4%? why are the architect fees up to $200k. i thought they would be $80k. what is the $617k of profit allowance? is that the developers profit to boost loan amount but not a real cost? total closing and application costs of 350k? that seems very high? who receives the 2 points? how much will be sunk costs if fha declines us? where is your 1%? are you receiving one of the points on the loan? what is the status on the operating pro forma? my back of the envelope puts noi at $877k assuming 625/1br, 1300/3br, 950/2br, 5% vacancy, and 40% expenses. after debt service that would only leave $122k. the coverage would only be 1.16. talk to you

cc: subject: greg, something that i forgot to ask you. do you know if hugo is planning to replatt using an administrative process which i understand is quicker than the full replatting process of 3 weeks? also let me know about the parking. the builder in san marcos believed the plan only had 321 parking spots but would require 382 by code. the townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem. they probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms. phillip keith holst sent you an email with the details. jacques, the agreement looks fine. my only comment is that george and larry might object to the language that \"the bank that was requested to finance the construction of the project declined to make the loan based on the high costs of the construction of the project\". technically, that bank lowered the loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of equity that would be required. did i loan them $1,300,000? i thought it was less. regarding exhibit a, the assets include: the land, architectural plans, engineering completed, appraisal, and soils study. most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants. i have been speaking directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. i am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. the obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above. do we need to list balances due or just list the work completed as an asset and give consideration of $5,875 for the cash paid to the engineer and appraisor. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 12/07/2000 09:08 am --------------------------- jeff richter 12/07/2000 06:31 am to: phillip k

rolling blackouts wed -sources (this article was originally published wednesday) los angeles (dow jones)--the california independent system operator paid about $10 million wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from powerex and still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the iso\\'s operation told dow jones newswires. but the iso fell short of ordering rolling blackouts wednesday for the third consecutive day. the iso wouldn\\'t comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market information. but sources said powerex, a subsidiary of british columbia hydro & power authority (x.bch), is the only energy company in the northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the iso paid about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening. but that still wasn\\'t enough juice. the los angeles department of water and power sold the iso 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of $250/mwh. the ladwp, which is not governed by the iso, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. it is free sell power instate above the $250/mwh price cap. the ladwp has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. the municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. however, the ladwp is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. the suit claims the ladwp sells some of its power it gets from the federal bonneville power administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. powerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the iso power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. but the company also sold the iso 1,000 megawatts tuesday - minutes before the iso was to declare rolling blackouts - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said. the iso, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. the iso is having to compete with investor-owned utilities in the northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. the iso warned federal regulators, generators and utilities wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency wednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. a stage three is declared when the iso\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. but iso spokesman patrick dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. \"in order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\" dorinson said. edison international unit (eix) southern california edison, sempra energy unit (sre) san diego gas & electric, pg&e corp. (pcg) unit pacific gas & electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. socal edison and pg&e are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. the utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. it\\'s still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. -by jason leopold, dow jones newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com (end) dow jones newswires 07-12-00 1318gmt copyright (c) 2000, dow jones & company inc 13:17 gmt 7 december 2000 dj calif iso, puc inspect off-line duke south bay pwr plant (this article was originally published wednesday) los angeles (dow jones)--representatives of the california independent system operator and public utilities commission inspected duke energy corp.\\'s (duk) off-line 700-mw south bay power plant in chula vista, calif., wednesday morning, a duke spokesman said. the iso and puc have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, iso spokesman pat dorinson said. about 11,000 mw of power has been off the state\\'s power grid since monday, 7,000 mw of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the iso. the iso manages grid reliability. as previously reported, the iso told utilities and the federal energy regulatory commission wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 pm pst (0100 gmt thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. however, the iso said the action wouldn\\'t result in rolling blackouts. the iso and puc also inspected tuesday plants owned by dynegy inc (dyn), reliant energy inc.

(aes) and dynegy inc. (dyn) said wednesday that representatives of california power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. the california independent system operator, which manages the state\\'s power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the california public utilities commission began on-site inspections tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, iso spokesman pat dorinson said. the state has had 11,000 mw off the grid since monday, 7,000 mw for unplanned maintenance. the iso wednesday called a stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. as reported earlier, reliant energy (rei) and southern energy inc. (soe) said they had been visited by representatives of the iso and puc tuesday evening. representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by aes and dynegy tuesday evening. aes told the visitors they couldn\\'t perform an unannounced full inspection of the company\\'s 450-megawatt huntington beach power station until wednesday morning, when the plant\\'s full staff would be present, aes spokesman aaron thomas said. thomas, as well as an iso spokesman, didn\\'t know whether the representatives returned wednesday for a full inspection. aes units down due to expired emissions credits the huntington beach facility and units at two other aes facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or nox, emission credits. they were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the south coast air quality management district to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, thomas said. aes has about 2,000 mw, or half its maximum output, off line. the entire huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 mw worth of units at its alamitos and redondo beach plants. the iso has asked aes to return its off line plants to operations, but aes has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. \"we\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\" thomas said. \"it\\'s not clear to us that the iso trumps the air quality district\\'s\" authority. as reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said tuesday that aes could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so. dynegy\\'s el segundo plant also visited by puc dynegy inc. (dyn) said the puc visited its 1,200 mw el segundo plant tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 mw worth, were off line wednesday. \"i guess our position is, \\'gee, we\\'re sorry you don\\'t believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that\\'s fine,\\'\" said dynegy spokesman lynn lednicky. lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. \"we\\'ve been doing all we can to get back in service,\" lednicky said. \"we even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\" lednicky added that the puc seemed satisfied with dynegy\\'s explanation of why its units were off line. -by jessica berthold, dow

marcos and you can reach me on my cell phone 713-410-4679 or email pallen70@hotmail.com. i was planning on stopping by to see hugo elizondo on thursday to drop off a check and give him the green light to file for replatting. what will change if we want to try and complete the project in phases. does he need to change what he is going to submit to the city. i spoke to gordon kohutek this morning. he was contracted to complete the soils study. he says he will be done with his report by the end of the week. i don\\'t know who needs this report. i told gordon you might call to inquire about what work he performed. his number is 512-930-5832. we spoke on the phone about most of these issues. talk to you later. phillip jacques, here is larry lewter\\'s response to my request for more

susan to work with me in moving the day trading activities from the denver office to houston. her specific goals will be to take over activities performed by nicole and theresa while generating eol products with me and in my absence. susan is currently learning how to use eol and sitara. she is also working on understanding the grid and the relationship between all the different trading points from opal to the mid-continent. my plan is to have susan go to the denver office during may bid-week (april 22 - april 24). i want her to be sitting with nicole and theresa during bid-week to see and learn everything they do during that time. i will probably want nicole and theresa to come to houston one more time to sit with us and the logistics team, maybe in early may. then, susan and i will both go to denver in late may or early june to meet industry people and to complete the transfer of operations to the houston office. we can finalize these plans early next week and make all the corresponding reservations. thank you, jay ina, can you help me approve this request? phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 03/19/2001 09:53 am

looks as if we will be able to use everything they have done (engineering, architecture, survey, appraisal). one point that is unclear is they claim that the $15,000 in extensions that they paid was applied to the purchase price of the land like earnest money would be applied. i looked at the closing statements and i didn\\'t see $15,000 applied against the purchase price. can you help clear this up. assuming we clear up the $15,000, we need to get the property released. keith and i are concerned about taking over the bishop corner partnership and the risk that there could be undisclosed liabilities. on the other hand, conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean. what is your inclination? call as soon as you have a chance to review. phillip

aod@newsdata.com to: cc: subject: behind the stage two fyi western price survey contacts cal-iso\\'s declaration of stage two alert this morning was triggered in part by decision of bonneville power administration to cease hour-to-hour sales into california of between 600 mw and 1,000 mw that it had been making for the past week. according to bpa, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. the agency said it had been telling california\\'s department of water resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended. cal-iso reported about 1,600 mw less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. yesterday, powerex said it was not selling into california because of concerns about its water reserves. bpa said it is still sending exchange energy into california, however. more details, if available, will be included in the friday edition of the western price survey and in california energy markets newsletter. thanks for the information. it would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned. i am surprised to hear that the only restricted shares left are the ones granted this january. i have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock. i believe i selected the minimum amount required to be kept in enron stock (50%). are you saying that all the previous grants have fully vested and been distributed to my deferral account?

the numbers as only $1400 in concessions. gentlemen, today i finally received some information on the status of the work done to date. i spoke to hugo alexandro at cuatro consultants. the property is still in two parcels. hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot and is ready to submit it to the city of san marcos. he has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey. in addition, he has begun to coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete. the total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which $14,000 are due now for work completed. we are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. if we can continue to use cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. hugo\\'s number is 512-295-8052. i thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions. i spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that. now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by kipp flores can be used. keith and i appreciate you meeting with us on sunday. we left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project. call me with feedback after you speak to hugo or with any other ideas about moving this project forward. phillip here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format. the summary presents the numbers as only $1400 in concessions. jacques, george finally sent me some information. please look over his email. he wants us to buy him out. keith and i think this is a joke. we still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to determine if it has any value going forward. i don\\'t believe the architect work will be of any use to us. i don\\'t think they deserve any compensation for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were proposing was unsupportable by the market. my version of a buyout is attached. i need your expert advise. i am ready to offer my version or threaten to foreclose. do they have a case that they are due money for their time? since their cost and fees didn\\'t hold up versus the market and we didn\\'t execute a contract, i wouldn\\'t think they would stand a chance. there isn\\'t any time to waste so i want to respond to their offer asap. call me with your thoughts. phillip

<cbpres@austin.rr.com> cc: subject: sagewood phase ii george, thank you for the opportunity to review your financing request for the sagewood phase ii project. upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. there are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the bank moving forward on the transaction. first, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a bedroom to bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. we adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing sagewood project. additionally, there are about 500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the city of san marcos, this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project. we have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000. i have summarized our issues as follows: 1. pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows: pro-forma bank\\'s adjustment unit unit rent rent/br unit rent rent/br 2 br/2.5 ba $1,150 $575 $950 $475 3 br/unit $1,530 $510 $1,250 $417 2. pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over. 3. a market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to potential gross income (pgi). 4. based on the bank\\'s revised n.o.i. of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom

(see attached file: mapttra.xls) - mapttra.xls please remove my name and information from the registered user list. do not sell my information. phillip allen darrell, today i let the builder/developer know that i would not proceed with his excessively high cost estimates. as he did not have the funds to take on the land himself, he was agreeable to turning over the land to me. i would like to proceed and develop the property. my thought is to compare the financing between bank one and fha. i would also like to compare construction and development services between what you can do and a local builder in san marcos that i have been speaking with. making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to be in order. i am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural work to date. once again the architect is kipp florres and the engineer is quattro consultants out of buda. let me know if you have an opinion about either. i look forward to working with you. talk to you tomorrow. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 03/07/2001 01:00 pm --------------------------- tim heizenrader 03/05/2001 09:06 am to: phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: tim belden/hou/ect@ect, chris gaskill/corp/enron@enron subject: revised long range hydro forecast phillip: here\\'s a summary of our current forecast(s) for pnw hydro. please give me a call when you have time, and i\\'ll explain the old biop / new biop issue. tim reagan, here is the cost estimate and proforma prepared by george and larry. i am faxing the site plan, elevation, and floor plans. phillip i just refaxed. please confirm receipt i faxed you the signed amendment. daryl, here is the file that includes the proforma, unit costs, and comps. this file was prepared by the builder/developer. the architect that has begun to work on the project is kipp flores. they are in austin. thank you for your time this evening. your comments were very helpful. i appreciate you and greg taking a look at this project. phillip allen pallen@enron.com 713-853-7041 al, i was not going to do the ms this year. thanks for the offer though. all is well here. we went to colorado last week and the kids learned to ski. work is same as always. how are things going at new power? is there any potential? phillip john, did you put frank hayden up to this? if this decision is up to me i would= =20 consider authorizing mike g., frank e., keith h. and myself to trade west= =20 power. what do you think? phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 03/06/2001= =20 10:48 am --------------------------- from: frank hayden/enron@enronxgate on 03/05/2001 09:27 am cst to: phillip k allen/hou/ect@ect cc: =20 subject: fw: cross commodity -----original message----- from: hayden, frank =20 sent: friday, march 02, 2001 7:01 pm to: presto, kevin; zufferli, john; mckay, jonathan; belden, tim; shively,= =20 hunter; neal, scott; martin, thomas; allen, phillip; arnold, john subject: cross commodity importance: high i=01,ve been asked to provide an updated list on who is authorized to cross= =20 trade what commodities/products. as soon as possible, please reply to this= =20 email with the names of only the authorized =01&cross commodity=018 traders= and=20 their respective commodities.

george, i am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. i still have the concerns that i had last week. specifically that the costs of our project are too high. i have gathered more information that support my concerns. based on my research, i believe the project should cost around $10.5 million. the components are as follows: unit cost, site work, & builders profit($52/sf) $7.6 million land 1.15 interim financing .85 common areas .80 total $10.4 since reagan\\'s last 12 units are selling for around $190,000, i am unable to get comfortable building a larger project at over $95,000/unit in costs. also, the comps used in the appraisal from austin appear to be class a properties. it seems unlikely that student housing in san marcos can produce the same rent or sales price. there should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property. i recognize that sagewood is currently performing at occupancy and $/foot rental rates that are closer to the appraisal and your pro formas, however, we do not believe that the market will sustain these levels on a permanent basis. supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance. after the real estate expert from houston reviewed the proforma and cost estimates, his comments were that the appraisal is overly optimistic. he feels that the permanent financing would potentially be around $9.8 million. we would not even be able to cover the interim financing. keith and i have reviewed the project thoroughly and are in agreement that we cannot proceed with total cost estimates significantly above $10.5 million. we would like to have a conference call tuesday afternoon to discuss alternatives. phillip george, i am back in the office and ready to focus on the project. i still

regarding the 2/16 rentroll: #2 has she actually paid the $150 deposit. her move in date was 2/6. it is not on any rentroll that i can see. #9 explain again what deposit and rent is transferring from #41 and when she will start paying on #9 #15 since he has been such a good tenant for so long. stop trying to collect the $95 in question. #33 missed rent. are they still there? #26 i see that she paid a deposit. but the file says she moved in on 1/30. has she ever paid rent? i can\\'t find any on the last three deposits. #44 have the paid for february? there is no payment since the beginning of the year. #33 you email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but i don\\'t see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit? the last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent. i need you to figure these out immediately. i emailed you a new file for 2/23 and have attached the last three rentroll in case you need to research these questions. i will not be in the office next week. if i can get connected you might be able to email me at pallen70@hotmail.com. otherwise try and work with gary on pressing issues. if there is an emergency you can call me at 713-410-4679. phillip

i don\\'t want to waste your time explaining the differences if the 1st forecast was very rough. the items i listed moved dramatically. also, some of the questions were just clarification of what was

to: phillip.k.allen@enron.com cc: subject: sagewood ii phillip - george richards asked that i drop you a line this morning to go over some details on the san marcos project. 1. first, do you know if i am to receive a personal financial statement from keith? i want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction. 2. second, without the forward or take-out our typical loan to cost (ltc) will be in the range of 75% - 80%. the proposed loan to value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical multi-family deal. given the above pro-forma performance on the sagewood townhomes, i am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% ltc. this, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal. 3. the bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the developers deferred profit. typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable. thanks, andrew ozuna real estate loan officer

some suggestions for projects for colleen: 1. review and document systems and processes - the handoffs from erms, tagg, unify, sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the parties trying to make improvements. i think i understand erms and tagg but the issues facing scheduling in unify are grey. 2. review and audit complex deals- under the \"assume it is messed up\" policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need further scrutiny. 3. review risk books- is enron accurately accounting for physical imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions? 4. lead trading track program- recruit, oversee rotations, design training courses, review progress and make cuts. 5. fundamentals- liason between trading and analysts. are we looking at everything we should? putting a person with a trading mentality should add some value and direction to the group. in fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second md to work part time to get it done. phillip the spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles. would you consider placing several spinning bikes out with the other exercise equipment and running a

won\\'t have a bad reaction. #20b missed rent? #26 has she paid any deposit or rent? #27 missed rent? jaques, after meeting with george and larry, it was clear that we have different definitions of cost and profit. their version includes the salary of a superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third party subs and materials. then there is a layer of \"construction management\" fees of 10%. there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money. but i think the majority of it is profit. finally the builders profit of 1.4 million. keith and i were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. after all, if they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? we were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition to the superintendent costs. george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using. i reviewed the estimates and the superintendents are listed but i don\\'t think the construction management fee is included. george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. i will review and let you know what i think. the gp issues don\\'t seem to be a point of contention. they are agreeable to the 3 out 4 approval process. let me know if you have opinions or sources that i can use to push for only true costs + 1.4 million. phillip george, please send the latest cost estimates when you get a chance this morning. phillip jeanie, lavorato

deposit. #13 i show she missed rent on 1/26 and still owes $140. #15 try and follow up with tomas about the $95. hopefully, he won\\'t have a bad reaction. #20b missed rent? #26 has she paid any

2/2 rentroll. the total does not equal the bank deposit. your earlier response answered the questions for #3,11,15,20a, and 35. but the deposit was $495 more than the rentroll adds up to. if the answer to this question lies in apartment 1,13, and 14, can you update this file and send it back. now i am going to work on a rentroll for this friday. i will probably send you some questions about the 2/9 rentroll. let\\'s get this stuff clean today. phillip no. i am on msn messenger. ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 02/14/2001 08:23 am ---------------------------

utility cap for there unit is when they move in. this needs to be written in on their lease. when you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up. have my dad read the memo before you put it out. you guys can make changes if you need to. next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators. we have to get this done next week. i will email you a form to use to record serial numbers. the prospective buyers want this information plus we need it for our records. something to look forward to. it is 2 pm and i have to leave the office. please have my dad call me with the information about the units at home 713-463-8626. he will know what i mean. talk to you later, phillip

this friday. sorry it is so late. there are a few problems with the rentroll from 2/2. 1. i know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. the missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below. 2. #1 did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26? 3. #3 did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2? 4. #11 missed on 2/2? 5. #13 missed on 1/26? 6. #14 missed on 2/2? 7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19? 8. #20a missed on 2/2? 9. #35 missed on 2/2? my guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. you may have sent me a message over the \"chat\" line that i don\\'t remember on some of these. i just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit. will have some time today to work on a utility letter. tried to call wade last night at 5:30 but couldn\\'t reach him. will try again today. i believe that a doctor from seguin is going to make an offer. did you meet them? if so, what did you think? phillip i will email you an updated operating statement with nov and dec tomorrow morning. what did the seguin doctor think of the place. how much could i get the stagecoach appraised for? do you still do appraisals? could it be valued on an 11 or 12 cap? jacques, can you draft the partnership agreement and the construction contract? the key business points are: 1. investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate 2. construction contract is cost plus $1.4 million 3. the investors\\' loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid. 4. all parties are gp\\'s but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions? 5. 60/40 split favoring the investors. with regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes costs. then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. keith and i would like to oversee the bookkeeping. the builders would be requred to fax all invoices within 48 hours. we also would want online access to the checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing but invoices were not being submitted. let me know if you can draft these agreements. the gp issue may need some tweaking. phillip allen 713-853-7041 pallen@enron.com ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 11/29/2000 10:01

jeff, my target is to get $225 back out of the stage. therefore, i could take a sales price of $740k and carry a second note of $210k. this would still only require $75k cash from the buyer. after broker fees and a title policy, i would net around $20k cash. you can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at $740 or higher with the terms described in the 1st email. do you want to give the new braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal. phillip jeff, i am not willing to guarantee to refinance the 1st lien on the stage in 4 years and drop the rate on both notes at that point to 8%. there are several reasons that i won\\'t commit to this. exposure to interest fluctuations, the large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer are the three biggest concerns. what i am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. the existing note does not come due until september 2009. that is a long time. the buyer may have sold the property. interest rates may be lower. i am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note. guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far. can you clarify the dates in the contract. is the effective date the day the earnest money is receipted or is it once the feasibility study is complete? hopefully the buyer can live with these terms. i got your fax from the new braunfels buyer. if we can\\'t come to terms with the first buyer i will get started on the list. email or call me later today. phillip susan, raised your issue to

smith. i think he was surprised that we were set up with email and msn messenger. he was not trying to insult you. i let jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all i can pay right now. i increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but i think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. as gary and wade continue to improve the property, i need you to try and improve the property\\'s tenants and reputation. the apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. it is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. i realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. i am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. we can look at again later in the year. i will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend. phillip lucy, please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the \"rent due\" column. the other questions i had about last week\\'s rent are: #15

why? i spoke to jeff smith. i think he was surprised that we were set up with email and msn messenger. he was not trying to insult you. i let jeff know that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the property. occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without jeff and you can show them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is. regarding the raise, $260/week plus the apartment is all i can pay right now. i increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet but i think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair. as gary and wade continue to improve the property, i need you to try and improve the property\\'s tenants and reputation. the apartments are looking better and better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing. remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants. it is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests. i realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running an errand for the property. i am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this time. we can look at again later in the year. i will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 02/02/2001 03:43 pm ---------------------------

problems to stay all night wednesday night and until 200 am friday in order to calc my book. while she is scheduled to rotate to the west desk soon, i think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in order to bring the work load to a sustainable level. i\\'d like to meet at 2:30 pm on monday to discuss this issue. please let me know if this time fits in your schedules. thanks, larry susan hours are out of hand. we need to find a solution. let\\'s meet on monday to assess the issue phillip got your email. i will let jacques know. i guess we can work out the finer points next week. the bank here in houston is dealing with their auditors this week, so unfortunately i did not hear from them this week. the are promising to have some feedback by monday. i will let you know as soon as i hear from them. phillip george, the probability of building a house this year is increasing. i have shifted to a slightly different plan. there were too many design items that i could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. now, i am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. one wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. the other wing would have a garage + guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. this plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. i am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. the center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. i am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. i don\\'t know if you can imagine the house i am trying to describe. i would like to come and visit you again this month. if it would work for you, i would like to drive up on sunday afternoon on feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. i would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didn\\'t have time for. i can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. call or email to let me know if this would work for you. pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work) phillip allen ps. channel 2 in houston ran a story yesterday (feb. 2) about a home in kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls. you should try their website or call the station to get the full story. it would makes a good case for breathable walls. 8500????? that\\'s twice as valuable as your car! can\\'t you get a used one for $3000? nice. how much? are you trying to keep the economy going? testing. sell low and buy high ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 01/31/2001 04:51 pm --------------------------- from: phillip k allen 01/12/2001 08:58 am to: 8774820206@pagenetmessage.net cc: subject: testing jeff, before you write off the stage, a few things to think about. 1. operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and repairs. plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. there are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on repairs. 2. what is an outside management firm going to do? a full time onsite manager is all that is required. as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite. 3. considering #1 & #2 $115,000 noi is not necessarily overstated. if you want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest. 4. getting cash out is not a priority to me. so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. a 10% note actually attractive. see below. my job just doesn\\'t give me the time to manage this property. this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort. sales price 705,000 1st lien 473,500 2nd lien 225,000 transfer fee 7,500 cash required 14,500 noi 100,000 1st lien 47,292 2nd lien 23,694 cash flow 29,014 cash on cash 200% these numbers are using the conservative noi, if it comes in at $115k then cash on cash return would be more like 300%. this doesn\\'t reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price. do you want to reconsider? let me know. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k

executive summary of the kpmg aud= it=20 report on southern california edison: =20 i. cash needs highlights: sce=01,s original cash forecast, dated as december 28, 2000, projects a com= plete=20 cash depletion date of february 1, 2001. since then sce has instituted a=20 program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation= s=20 and other measures.=20 based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, sce=01,s=20 available cash improved through january 19 from an original estimate of $51= .8=20 million to $1.226 billion. the actual cash flow, given these cash=20 conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. ii. credit relationships highlights: sce has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20 extend or renew credit as it has become due. at present, there are no additional sources of credit open to sce. sce=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau= lt.=20 generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a= nd=20 payable. sce=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond= =20 indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20 indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. credit ratings agencies have downgraded sce=01,s credit ratings on most of = its=20 rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade= =20 issues within the last three weeks. iii. energy cost scenarios highlights this report section uses different cpuc supplied assumptions to assess=20 various price scenarios upon sce=01,s projected cash depletion dates. under= such=20 scenarios, sce would have a positive cash balance until march 30, 2001. iv. cost containment initiatives highlights sce has adopted a $460 million cost reduction plan for the year 2001. the plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital= =20 improvement component as follows (in millions): operating and maintenance costs $ 77 capital improvement costs 383 total $ 460 the plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to= =20 be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr= om=20 contract employees. under the plan, capital improvement costs totaling $383 million are for the= =20 most part being deferred to a future date. sce dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20 executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20 savings of approximately $92 million. v. accounting mechanisms to track stranded cost recovery (tra and tcba=20 activity) highlights: as of december 31, 2000, sce reported an overcollected balance in the=20 transition cost balancing account (tcba) account of $494.5 million. this=20 includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20 million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. as of december 31, 2000, sce reported an undercollected balance in sce=01,s= =20 transition account (tra) of $4.49 billion. normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the tcba at th= e=20 end of each year. however, the current generation memorandum account credit= =20 balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the tcba, pursuant to=20 d.01-01-018. costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the tra and revenues from=20 generation are tracked in the tcba. because these costs and revenues are=20 tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20 expressed in the tra, are overstated. turn proposal as part of our review, the cpuc asked that we comment on the proposal of tu= rn=20 to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset= s.=20 our comments are summarized as follows: the proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of sce in that i= t=20 would not directly generate nor use cash. the proposal=01,s impact on sce=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh= ift=20 costs between two regulatory assets. turn=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and= the=20 revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection = in=20 the tra is overstated. vi. flow of funds analysis highlights: in the last five years, sce had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a= =20 positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. during the same time period, sce paid dividends and other distributions to= =20 its parent, edison international, of approximately $4.8 billion. edison international used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its= =20 shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm= on=20 stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati= ve=20 and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. [there is no section vii] =20 viii. earnings of california affiliates sce=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500= =20 million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20 in 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.= =20 this increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period. a copy of the report is available on the commission website at=20 www.cpuc.ca.gov. =20 dan george, in response to your ideas time and cost 1. i realize that asking for a fixed price contract would result in the builder using a higher estimate to cover uncertainty. that how about 3:30 lucy, what is the latest? write me a note about what is going on and what issues you need my help to deal with when you send the rentroll. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on 01/30/2001 11:21 am --------------------------- susan j mara@enron 01/30/2001 09:14 am to: alan

like i need to get around $745k to breakeven. i don\\'t need the cash out right now so if i could get a personal guarantee and jaques craig can work out the partnership transfer, i would definitely be willing to carry a second lien. i understand second liens are going for 10%-12%. checkout this spreadsheet. these numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes. however, i am very concerned about the way it is being shown. having lucy show it is not a good idea. i need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property. my dad doesn\\'t have the time and i don\\'t trust lucy or wade to show it correctly. i would prefer for you to show it from now on. i will have the operating statements complete through december by this friday. phillip

illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. at permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, i feel the 65/35 is a fair split. however, as i mentioned earlier, i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. builder doesn\\'t benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in november) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule this way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 phillip george, we should hear

update this from a conference call with iep tonight at 5 pm: re; non-gas-fired qfs -- the last e-mail i sent includes the latest version of the iep proposal. negotiations with sce on this proposal are essentially complete. pg&e is ok with the docs. all qfs but calpine have agreed with the iep proposal -- under the proposal, pg&e would \"retain\" $106 million (of what, i\\'m not sure -- i think they mean a refund to pg&e from qfs who switched to px pricing). the money would come from changing the basis for the qf payments from the px price to the srac price, starting back in december (and maybe earlier). pg&e will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the force majeure notices off the table. qfs are asking iep to attempt to get some assurances of payment. sce has defaulted with its qfs; pg&e has not yet -- but big payments are due on 2/2/01. for gas-fired qfs -- heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for pg&e\\'s purchases from such qfs. two people are negotiating the these agreements (elcantar and bloom), but they are going very slowly. not clear this can be resolved. batten and keeley are refereeing this. no discussions on this occurred today. status of legislation -- keeley left town for the night, so not much will happen on the qfs.assembly and senate realize they have to work together. plan to meld together ab 1 with hertzberg\\'s new

the kansas city star date: 01/20/01 22:15 as natural gas prices rose in december, traders at the new york mercantile exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas storage number. the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the forecast was for frigid weather. traders put the two together, anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \"traders do that all the time; they\\'re looking forward,\" said william burson, a trader. \"it makes the market for natural gas.\" but the market\\'s response perplexed chris mcgill, the american gas association\\'s director of gas supply and transportation. he had compiled the storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than reality. \"it\\'s a little frustrating that they don\\'t take the time to understand what we are reporting,\" mcgill said. as consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- and culprits -- is on. some within the natural gas industry are pointing fingers at wall street. stephen adik, senior vice president of the indiana utility nisource, recently stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\\'s speculators for the rise in gas prices. \"it\\'s my firm belief ... that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" adik told the trade magazine public utilities fortnightly. in california, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame for this winter\\'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect their customers and constituents from such price spikes. most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas prices before they soared. \"we\\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said paul snider, a spokesman for missouri gas energy. but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \"there\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to change,\" said ed krapels, director of gas power services for energy security analysis inc., an energy consulting firm in wakefield, mass. hot topic consumers know one thing for certain: their heating bills are up sharply. in many circles, little else is discussed. the rev. vincent fraser of glad tidings assembly of god in kansas city is facing a $1,456 december bill for heating the church -- more than double the previous december\\'s bill. church members are suffering from higher bills as well. the sunday collection is down, said fraser, who might have to forgo part of his salary. for the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \"it\\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said. a year ago that wasn\\'t a fear. wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn\\'t make it worthwhile to drill for gas. utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers. but trouble was brewing. by spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage for winter. there was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. by early november, prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. the federal energy information administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. but $10 gas was coming. below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, including the kansas city area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas markets. \"it\\'s all about the weather,\" said krapels of energy security analysis. wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the new york traders. natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile commodity in the world. setting the price in the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of gas, allowing it to float. in 1990, the new york mercantile began trading contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had widespread influence over gas prices. the futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon as next month or as far ahead as three years. suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce. and big gas consumers, from utilities to companies such as farmland industries inc., can lock in what they pay for the gas they expect to use. there are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge of natural gas. but if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don\\'t need to know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they\\'re trading. like all futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. that leverage adds to their volatility and to the traders\\' ability to make or lose a lot of money in a short time. as december began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less than $7 per thousand cubic feet. by the end of the month it was nearly $10. much of the spark for the rally came from the american gas association\\'s weekly storage numbers. utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to need in the winter. going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in hopes that the summer\\'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. still, the american gas association offered assurances that supplies would be sufficient. but when below-normal temperatures arrived in november, the concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. then the american gas association reported the lowest year-end storage numbers since they were first published in 1994. still, said the association\\'s mcgill, there was sufficient gas in storage. but some utility executives didn\\'t share that view. william eliason, vice president of kansas gas service, said that if december\\'s cold snap had continued into january, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \"i was getting worried,\" he said. then suddenly the market turned when january\\'s weather turned warmer. wednesday\\'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. just passing through some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but pass their fuel costs on to customers. among area utilities, kansas gas service increased its customers\\' cost-of-gas charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. and missouri gas energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin wednesday. sheila lumpe, chairwoman of the missouri public service commission, said last month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve energy. kansas gas service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to save an average customer about $25 this winter. missouri gas energy has no hedging program. it waited until fall to seek an extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills. and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs. on friday, doug micheel, senior counsel of the missouri office of the public counsel, said his office would ask the missouri public service commission to perform an emergency audit of missouri gas energy\\'s gas purchasing practices. \"consumers are taking all the risk,\" micheel said. \"it\\'s time to consider some changes.\" to reach steve everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to severly@kcstar.com. -- all content , 2001

that the construction management fee (cmf) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%. this will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity. also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high. therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as the met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or cmf, which is $54-55 with cmf. it appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876. however, i am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5mm. i hope to finish the proforma today. the rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ada units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom. additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month. - winmail.dat jim, here are the key gas contacts. work home cell phillip allen x37041 713-463-8626

tenants since december 15th are: are we running an apartment complex or a motel? please update all lease information on the 1/12 rentroll and email it to me this afternoon. phillip larry, do you want the loan and wire amount to be for exactly $1.1 million. phillip thanks for representing matt. phillip george, here is a spreadsheet that illustrates the payout of investment and builders profit. check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation. at permanent financing $1.1 would be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year. since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the investment, i feel the 65/35 is a fair split. however, as i mentioned earlier, i think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as part of the construction contract. just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look like here are a few ideas: 1. fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. builder doesn\\'t benefit from higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder. 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase 1 complete in november) +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule this way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but could be as favorable as 55/45. i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon. feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626 phillip lucy, here is a schedule of the most recent utility bills and the overages. there are alot of overages. it will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather. you need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap. this needs to be handwritten on all new leases. i am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet. we also need to write a short letter remind everyone about the cap and the need to conserve energy if they don\\'t want to exceed their cap. i will write something today. wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting. phillip we do not understand our var. can you please get us all the detailed reports and component var reports that you can produce? the sooner the better. phillip ted, andrea in the analysts pool asked me to fill out this request. can you help expedite this

apartments? 20a or #13? utility overages for #26 and #44? where did you get these amounts? for what periods? what is going on with #42. do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! that will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. i would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. if that doesn\\'t work, we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. this tenant has been here since september 1998, i don\\'t want to run them off. i check with the bank and i did not see that a deposit was made on tuesday so i couldn\\'t check the total from the rentroll against the bank. is this right? has the deposit been made yet? a rentroll for jan 5th will follow shortly. phillip cannot open this file. please send in different format i

comments/suggestions we met with gov davis on thursday evening in la. in attendance were ken lay, the governor, the governor\\'s staff director (kari dohn) and myself. the gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas. he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday. attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared. below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor\\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor\\'s comments: overview: we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees. his staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level. he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000mw). he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by \\'02 and provide some political cover. our proposals: i have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also included the forward price information several of you provided). he seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 mw of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases. as already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. his ideas: the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\". some of these ideas would require legislative action. state may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of generation plants. the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. this was a frequently recurring theme. utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers. municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california. state universities (including uc/csu and the community colleges) would more widely deploy distributed generation. expand in-state gas production. take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies. empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time. condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how nordpool works(jeff- someone in schroeder\\'s group should be able to help out here). wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators. securitize uncollected power purchase costs. to dos: (jeff, again i\\'d like to prevail on you to assemble the group\\'s thoughts and get them to kari) he wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- not just the 5 one year strips. he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday. he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal. he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues. thanks to everyone for their help. we made some progress today. trading profits p. allen 200 m. grigsby 463 rest of desk 282 total 945 i view my bonus as partly

mortgage broker for help with the financing. regarding the financing, i am working with jim murnan at pinnacle mortgage here in houston. i have sent him some information on the project, but he needs financial information on you. can you please send it to him. his contact information is: phone (713)781-5810, fax (713)781-6614, and email jim123@pdq.net. i know larry has been working with a bank and they need my information. i hope to pull that together this afternoon. i took the liberty of calling thomas reames from the frog pond document. he was positive about his experience overall. he did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor. i think we should discuss these procedures in advance. let\\'s continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur. phillip jim, i would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project i described to you last week. the project is a 134 unit apartment complex in san marcos. there will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. as i mentioned last week, i would like to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. if there is a creative way to structure the deal, i would like to hear your suggestions. one idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a \"forward commitment\" in order to reduce the equity required. i would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. specifically, the transition from interim to permanent financing. i could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks. i am faxing you a project summary. and i will have the builder/developer email or fax his financial statement to you. let me know what else you need. the land is scheduled to close mid january. phillip allen jeff, everything should be done for closing on the leander deal on the 29th. i have fed ex\\'d the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow. when will more money be required? escrow for roads? utility connections? other rezoning costs? what about property taxes? the burnet land lost its ag exemption while i owned it. are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this property? can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes once the property is rezoned? do we need to find a farmer and give him grazing rights? what are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and annexing? i am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and american multifamily walking on this deal. so i just want to make sure we are pushing the process as fast as we can. phillip ---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allen/hou/ect on

anything else you need. phillip steve, i am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. if you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626. as far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1. examine ldc\\'s incentive rate program. current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost. the result is that the ldc\\'s sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. this creates a shortage in later months. 2. california has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. investigate why it wasn\\'t maximized operationally. specific questions should include: 1. why in march \\'00-may \\'00 weren\\'t total system receipts higher in order to fill storage? 2. why are there so many examples of ofo\\'s on weekends that push away too much gas from socal\\'s system. i believe socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. they repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3. similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. not enough forward hedging is done by the major ldcs. by design the customers are short at a floating rate. this market has been long historically. it has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted. call me if you need any more input. phillip monique sanchez jay reitmeyer randy gay matt lenhart john, here is our north of stanfield forecast for jan. supply jan \\'01 dec \\'00 jan

11:30 george, the san marcos project is sounding very attractive. i have one other investor in addition to keith that has interest. some additional background information on larry and yourself would be helpful. background questions: please provide a brief personal history of the two principals involved in creekside. please list projects completed during the last 5 years. include the project description, investors, business entity, please provide the names and numbers of prior investors. please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects. with regard to the proposed investment structure, i would suggest a couple of changes to better align the risk/reward profile between creekside and the investors. preferable investment structure: developers guarantee note, not investors. preferred rate of return (10%) must be achieved before any profit sharing. builder assumes some risk for cost overruns. since this project appears so promising, it seems like we should tackle these issues now. these questions are not intended to be offensive in any way. it is my desire to build a successful project with creekside that leads to future opportunities. i am happy to provide you with any information that you need to evaluate myself or keith as a business partner. sincerely, phillip allen bob, patti sullivan held together the scheduling group for two months while randy gay was on a personal leave. she displayed a tremendous amount of commitment to the west desk during that time. she frequently came to work before 4 am to prepare operations reports. patti worked 7 days a week during this time. if long hours were not enough, there was a pipeline explosion during this time which put extra volatility into the market and extra pressure on patti. she didn\\'t crack and provided much needed info during this time. patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr. specialist. based on her heroic efforts, she deserves a pbr. let me know what is an acceptable cash amount. phillip andy, please assign a user name to randy gay. thank you, phillip andy, i spoke to john l. and he ok\\'d one of each new electronic system

allen\" <pallen@enron.com> cc: \"larry lewter\" <retwell@mail.sanmarcos.net>, \"claudia l. crocker\" <clclegal2@aol.com> subject: investment structure structure: typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or llc) general partner. the general partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction. land ownership & loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership. each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans. if the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits is reduced. all loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans. if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse. use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders, llc. these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period. early land costs the $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing. as an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value. with a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees. equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin, the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\". this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa. this release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion. releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction. these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit. as such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent. because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds. the lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which i suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000. this would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000 per lot. with estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs. thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement. phasing works as follows. if the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. the land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which i would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. this would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000. this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint. construction loans there are three types of construction loans. first, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. second, is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name. third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer. we expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer. we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process. spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will be from 80% to 95% of value. disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement. the general partner will contract with creekside builders, llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. these fees are the only monies to creekside, larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform. for example, if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. finally, cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. at present cb does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading. reporting we are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. what did you have in mind? i would like to use some form of internet based reporting. bookkeeping i am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\" please expand. investor input we are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials. as always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience i have always been able to reach consensus. as you, and i presume keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating. creekside proceedures cb procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates. in the extremely tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped. pre-selected professionals, subs and vendors yes there are many different subs that have been identified and i can provide these if you are interested. i know i have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further. sincerely, george richards president, creekside builders, llc -

us$85= 4 million or us$0.27 per common share. including the incremental provisions= and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for th= e third quarter of 2001 was us$2.18 billion, or us$0.68 per common share, c= ompared to pro forma net earnings of us$597 million, or us$0.19 per common = share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000. in the quarter, in= cremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operat= ions(a) were comprised of: us$750 million (pre-tax) for excess and obsolete= inventory, primarily related to optical inter-city; us$767 million (pre-ta= x) for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer finan= cing; and us$380 million (pre-tax) primarily related to charges associated = with

said john roth, president and chief exe= cutive officer nortel networks. \"our bottom line results reflected the impa= ct of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. during th= e third quarter of 2001, nortel networks continued to aggressively implemen= t its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. the= company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive b= reak even at a quarterly revenue level well below us$4 billion. the structu= re is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.\" frank dunn, = the company\\'s new president and chief executive officer effective november = 1, 2001, said, \"nortel networks is focusing its investments and its organiz= ation to drive continued leadership across three businesses: metro networks= , which encompasses metro optical networking, ip networking, ip services an= d voice over ip solutions for service providers and enterprises; wireless n= etworks; and optical long haul networks. in the quarter, our product progra= ms continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading p= ortfolio of solutions. we also continued to work with our customers to help= them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reduct= ions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of oppor= tunities for new revenue streams. some key milestones over the past 120 day= s included: -- the first north american ilec began the circuit to = packet transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade = softswitch; -- announced metro dwdm wins in the united states, europe = and japan; -- announced multiservice backbone awards (atm, ip,= mpls) in china, germany and asia; -- continued progress on 3g= wireless internet infrastructure

switching capability on our layer 2-3 edge = switch router; and -- completed hardware design, significantly advanc= ed software integration and began production of optera connect hdx = solution.\" as announced on october 2, 2001, the company expects = to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion o= f its work plan. notifications to employees impacted by workforce reduction= s are expected to be substantially completed by the end of october 2001. a = workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quart= er of 2001. over the next few quarters, the company also expects to continu= e to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. the numbe= r of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including= the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ul= timately approach 10,000 positions. commenting on cash management in the = quarter, frank dunn said, \"we are extremely pleased with the results that h= ave been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a signifi= cant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operatio= ns. in addition, the company further increased its financial flexibility by= completing a highly successful us$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which= , combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operati= ons and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhan= ced our strong liquidity position. given the industry correction and action= s we have taken over the last two quarters, nortel networks balance sheet i= s well positioned.\" \"while we believe we are beginning to see early indic= ations that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainabl= e levels, it still remains difficult to predict. in light of this and the u= ncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wa= ke of the september 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and bu= sinesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth qua= rter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,\" concluded dunn. r= evenue breakdown from continuing operations network infrastructure reven= ues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third= quarter of 2000. wireless internet solutions grew substantially in canada = and slightly in asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline = in latin america, a slight decline in the united states and a decline in eu= rope. optical inter-city revenues were down sharply in the united states, e= urope and latin america, minimally offset by growth in asia. local internet= revenues were down substantially in the united states, europe, canada and = latin america, which were minimally offset by an increase in asia. photon= ic components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter co= mpared to the same period

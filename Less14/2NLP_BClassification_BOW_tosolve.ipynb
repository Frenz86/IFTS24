cholodenko\\'s \" high art , \" is an intelligent , quiet drama . \\nits strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters . \\nthey are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged . \\njudging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers\\' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of . \\nsyd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high-profile photography magazine , \" frame . \" \\nshe very much enjoys where her career is headed , but is often not taken very seriously by her managers , who are always giving her petty jobs to do , when she knows she could be doing more important things . \\none night , while taking a bath , syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers , so when she goes up there to inform them of it , she meets lucy beliner ( ally sheedy ) , a thin , worn-out , and unhappy woman , who lives with her drug-addicted german girlfriend , greta ( patricia clarkson ) , a pathetic former actress who is usually so out-of-it that she often is in and out of conciousness . \\nsyd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy , and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before . \\nlucy claims she doesn\\'t want to get back into the profession , but syd manages to convince the \" frame \" editors to do a piece on her work . \\nall the while , syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy , even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman , and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons . \\n \" high art , \" is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger-coated or idealized , but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere , while syd\\'s luck begins to rise . \\nthe film in no way is about lesbianism , but about love , which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality . \\nas lucy and syd grow closer and closer together , we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doomed . \\nwith this picture , ally sheedy\\'s star has risen once again , thanks to her touching , nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy , a woman who , in the course of a decade , has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs , which has taken away her once-blossoming career . \\nher characted really is tragic , and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother , in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she can\\'t help her , is heartbreaking . \\nalthough not autobiographical , sheedy has had drug problems in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy\\'s footsteps to her role . \\nalso very good is radha mitchell as syd , who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy , \" love and other catastrophes , \" wh caught me by surprise with her performance . \\neasily being able to pass as christina ricci\\'s older sister , mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently . \\nas accurate as almost every detail is in , \" high art , \" i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james , who , played by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role . \\nby the time he finds out about syd and lucy , he disappears from the film , and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other . \\nthis is a very minor fault , however , in a film that is full of riches . \\nalthough many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair , syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems . \\nthe character of dominique ( anh duong ) , the \" frame \" editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas , was also written to be far more mature than expected . \\nand the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done . \\nfor once , it did not invlove steaminess , or violent sexual activity , or gratuitous nudity , but focused on the actual characters , who love each other , and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex . \\n \" high art , \" which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival , marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko , as well as sheedy\\'s strongest , and best , role to date . \\n',\n"," b'wolfgang petersen\\'s latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple . \\nit only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it\\'s going to hurt ? quite a bit . \\nok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here\\'s my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn\\'t really much of a story to tell . \\nbasically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of \" the storm of the century . \" \\nhow much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? \\nnot nearly enough . \\nso he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous . \\naudiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel . \\nthe last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters . \\ni have yet to read sebastian junger\\'s the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale . \\nbased on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak . \\nusing a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality . \\nright away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who\\'s always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . \\nso many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer . \\nit is not the all-star cast\\'s fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal . \\nallen payne\\'s character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he\\'s never given any lines ! \\nare we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? \\nfichtner\\'s character is terribly underdeveloped - we don\\'t know what he\\'s doing there , where he\\'s from , or who he\\'s supposed to be . \\nthe remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene \" you know what would look good on you ? \\nme ! \" \\nooooh real creative ) . \\nas the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human . \\nonly when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk . \\nthe computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real . \\ni can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again . \\nthis is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film . \\nthe perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment . \\nthe maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so . \\ni guess i\\'ll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ? \\n',\n"," b'i won\\x12t even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films . \\ni saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 , but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them . \\nso take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard day\\x12s work . \\ni didn\\x12t just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing \\x16 but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning . \\nsigourney weaver , who\\x12s role in alien earned her an academy award nomination , plays the character of \\x13ripley , \\x14 who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 . 200 years later , scientists\\x12 use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley - including the alien that was stuck inside her . \\nin no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two ; yet ripley is now not completely human , possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being . \\ni\\x12m sure someone can explain exactly why this is so , but for now we\\x12ll just ignore it and move on . \\nwhy , you ask , would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated ? \\nwell , the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature . \\nthese were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research . \\nthey ( yawn ) were wrong . \\nit doesn\\x12t take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un-flossed teeth . \\nthere\\x12s a little saying that goes something like this : \\x13if you\\x12re going to make a bad film , do it well . \\x14 \\ni have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies , but they are not the ones that really bother me . \\nalien resurrection , a good example of a film that really gets up my nose , is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one . \\nthere is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore , which attempts to distract us from the wandering-but-not-going-anywhere plot . \\nin one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off . \\nanother one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to . \\nfair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story , but this is unfortunately not the case , and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable . \\nif you think i\\x12m struggling to find one good aspect about the film , then you thought right . \\none exciting scene is a credit ( and the only part remotely worth seeing ) to the film , in which an alien chases two men ( one a cripple ) up a tall ladder with interesting results . \\nbut of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard , and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis . \\nso in a film where the one liners come as bad as \\x13earth man , what a shit hole\\x14 and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent , its no wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is . \\noh , and in case you\\x12re wondering about my bag of lollies \\x16 the less i enjoy a film , the more i eat . \\nso all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes ; but however empty the bag turned out to be , it was still a long way ahead of the movie\\x05 \\n',\n"," b'there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . \\none of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one . \\nits popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . \\ncasablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . \\none of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time . \\nit was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn\\'t been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers\\' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director . \\nhowever , the movie was commercially successful and earned three \" oscars \" , including the one for the best film . \\nuntil this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age . \\nthe plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . \\nin december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . \\nthousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . \\nmany shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) . \\nhis best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of \" sticking his neck for nobody \" . \\nhowever , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . \\nthis event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . \\none of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . \\nhe is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . \\nthe couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . \\nrick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . \\nthe casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . \\nbogart\\'s portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character . \\nanother icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime . \\nthe cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn\\'t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . \\nfor many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . \\nbut the reason for that isn\\'t the romance itself - it\\'s the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life . \\nthe casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . \\nthe supporting actors also did a marvellous job . \\nsidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston\\'s maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . \\nanother shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . \\nunfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling . \\nhowever , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . \\ncaptain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . \\ndespite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . \\nrains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault\\'s relationship towards rick , and rick\\'s final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . \\ntogether with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . \\nprofessional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic . \\nany way , even if we don\\'t see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration . \\n',\n"," b'albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time . \\nwith a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way . \\nwhile this may not be his finest work , \" the muse \" still shakes up some delightful humor . \\nin albert brook\\'s latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who\\'s losing his edge , as his business partners say . \\nin desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past . \\nhe asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career . \\nso brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc . as a sort of payment . \\nthe real punch line however , doesn\\'t come until the end . \\nit really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ? \\nthe idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner . \\nspeaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter . \\nevery time he graces the screen , i can\\'t help but start laughing . \\nalbert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character . \\nthe real problem with the film lies with sharon stone . \\nshe wasn\\'t likeable at all . \\nbrooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through . \\nin a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak . \\nluckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone\\'s mishap . \\nit was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because \" the muse \" had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy . \\non a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook\\'s wife . \\nshe is always a nice addition as a supporting actress , because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she\\'s in . \\nthe funniest moments in \" the muse \" in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese . \\ni mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary . \\nit was just plain hilarious . \\nit just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas . \\nbrilliant move by brooks . \\nas i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it\\'s proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before . \\nunlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that\\'s desperate for jokes , it\\'s rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood . \\n \" bowfinger \" had it\\'s moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but \" the muse \" still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour . \\nby the end of the film , you\\'re glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it . \\nfor once i\\'m not fully disappointed , because the film didn\\'t slow down , it kept moving , even with some flaws . \\nthumbs up to brooks for his brave effort . \\ni think he\\'ll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future . \\n',\n"," b\"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . \\na time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . \\nit is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . \\nright from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . \\na pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . \\nafter their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . \\nmcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . \\nthe acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . \\nsandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . \\nthe most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \\ni always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \\nthere is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \\nbecause the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \\none of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . \\ni was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . \\nthe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . \\nfirst of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . \\nhe's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . \\nthe old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . \\nit just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . \\nanother mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . \\ni'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . \\n ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) \\nis jackson's character then simply insane ? \\nthat prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . \\none of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . \\nmcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . \\nhow did the prosecution get this information ? \\nhow come he didn't get it ? \\nthe whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . \\nthis is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . \\nit's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . \\nat two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . \\nit's all handwaving . \\nthe closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . \\nit's not easy to make a movie about something . \\nthe other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . \\na time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \\n\",\n"," b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\neast meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney\\'s parade of annual animated feature films . \\nan odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . \\nthough not for lack of trying . \\nin many respects , mulan is among disney\\'s most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . \\nthe violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child\\'s discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan\\'s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? \\nin an instant , idealistic mulan\\'s innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . \\nthe film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family\\'s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . \\ndipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney\\'s new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film\\'s vocal work , there\\'s liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . \\nwhile the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can\\'t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it\\'s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . \\nthe film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it\\'s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan\\'s land . \\nat its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . \\nas such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity . \\nscenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan\\'s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . \\nmulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine\\'s character-defining opening half-hour . \\nit\\'s when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . \\noff to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little \" lucky \" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief . \\nthey\\'re affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . \\nat training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang . \\neverybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . \\nthe romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story\\'s neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . \\nanother staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . \\ncomposed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- \" i\\'ll make a man out of you \" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . \\nonly \" reflections \" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre\\'s most wondrously pure voices . \\nnonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . \\nwhile the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they\\'re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . \\nbriskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter . \\n',\n"," b'what a contrast ! \\nin the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly . \\ni\\'m not sure you could get two more different movies . \\nwhile the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it . \\nthis is one interesting movie . \\nit\\'s very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of \\'98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty . \\nthere\\'s lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men . \\nhurlyburly doens\\'t contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him . \\nhis big question is : does it all pertain to him ? \\nand if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? \\n \" it \" means everything : television , friends , events that happen . \\ni guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what\\'s it all about ? \\nthis is not a movie for answers . \\ndonna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they\\'re not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions . \\nthat\\'s what makes this movie stay on your mind . \\nthese are the sorts of questions that occupy our time . \\neven when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do . \\nthe performances are all superb in hurlyburly . \\ni haven\\'t seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can\\'t remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this . \\neddie isn\\'t a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable . \\ni don\\'t want to be his friend but i\\'d like to help him . \\nchazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person . \\ni\\'d never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend . \\neveryone in this film nails their performances , making this world real . \\nit\\'s a nasty world ; it\\'s a sexist world . \\nunlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man\\'s world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men . \\ni find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing . \\nfirst , it\\'s depressing that such a world exists . \\na large part of hurlyburly\\'s success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings . \\nsure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background . \\nsecond , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men\\'s world . \\nwhere are the stories about women\\'s world ? \\nnot the soap operas and the \" chick flicks \" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men . \\nhurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts . \\nit\\'s very talkative , intelligent and static . \\nwhile this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they\\'re quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing . \\nnot all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas . \\nnot all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience . \\nall it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen . \\nit also means that you have to pay attention . \\n',\n"," b'poster boy for co-dependency needs patching \\npatch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael

feel the need to have more things ? \\nto make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product . \\nthe sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality . \\nthe film industry is like any other . \\nin order for studios to survive , they have to make money . \\nthe prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit . \\nsome movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used . \\nthere aren\\'t enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary . \\nfor some reason , it\\'s never crossed anyone\\'s mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit . \\noften , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones . \\nat you can have a good time making fun of bad movies . \\ni\\'m not suggesting that \" patch adams \" was tossed out just to rake in the bucks . \\nmy guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel . \\nit features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it\\'s as dull as could be . \\nhunter \" patch \" adams\\' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis . \\nchecking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around . \\npatch could be a poster boy for co-dependency . \\nhe explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn\\'t focus on his own problems . \\nhe decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia . \\nas a med student , patch\\'s antics at the school\\'s hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton ) . \\nthe dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he\\'s one of the top students . \\nhe writes in patch\\'s academic file that he shows \" excessive happiness . \" \\ni walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing . \\nthere also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies . \\nthen it struck me . \\nit must be based on a true story . \\nthe movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic . \\nrobin williams is an amazing actor . \\nwhile he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits . \\nthat\\'s what makes his failure here so remarkable . \\npatch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat . \\nsomething holds him back . \\nmost of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional . \\nfor a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it\\'s curious that the ones here are cardboard characters . \\npeter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person . \\nunfortunately he\\'s in the film for only about two minutes . \\nthe audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene .

\" is a good title for the film . \\nit is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of . \\nthe full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment types . \\nthere\\'s a touching death . \\nthen there\\'s another . \\nthe film doesn\\'t trust us to get it the first time . \\nthe dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again . \\nworst of all is the final courtroom bit . \\nscary-looking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people . \\nthe room is packed with patch\\'s supporters . \\nwilliams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all . \\nit has as much emotion as his earlier statement \" humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species \" contains truth . \\nmost of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk . \\nshadyac also directed the first \" ace ventura \" movie . \\noedekerk directed the second one . \\nneed i say more ? \\nthe real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases . \\nthe film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care . \\nthe \" doctors are not gods \" theme will resonate with a number of people , but it\\'s so poorly produced that no one will care . \\n',\n"," b'everyone\\'s heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene . \\neveryone\\'s heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over . \\nand everyone\\'s got to admit that they will never travel down a

about what happens , here\\'s your spoiler warning . \\ndeliverance was a real shocker for it\\'s time ( 1972 ) . \\nmajor advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry . \\nwhen it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences . \\nit was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) . \\nbut by today\\'s film standards and in today\\'s world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn\\'t as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e . g . \\npulp fiction ) . \\npulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny . \\nbut in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter . \\nthe story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory . \\nthe initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others . \\njoining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox ) . \\nthe group\\'s first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where

us say , genetically challenged . \\nthe men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way . \\neverything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone . \\nthey encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them . \\ned is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men . \\ned nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist\\'s back . \\nthe other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body . \\ndisposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film . \\nwhile attempting to make a quick \" paddle for it \" , both canoes tip over . \\ndrew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found . \\nlewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition . \\nthis leaves ed and bobby . \\ned decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly , alone , with the bow and arrow . \\nthe question arises if he will be able to handle himself , as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a

is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic . \\nit\\'s definitely one of those \" must see \" movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade . \\n',\n"," b' \" deep rising \" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films . \\nwhile dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring\\'s \" anaconda \" -- \" deep rising \" has no tongue to put in its cheek . \\nfolks , we\\'re only a month into the new year , and already here\\'s a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases . \\nmost of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen \" titanic , \" then maybe they\\'d have known to stay home ) when it\\'s attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature . \\nthe only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members . \\na mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby . \\nbut what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful . \\nthe main problem with \" deep rising \" is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory . \\nthe concept is \" leviathan \" meets \" titanic , \" with a dash of \" speed 2 \" thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? ) \\nmeasure . \\nthis monster is equal parts \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" and \" the relic , \" knows how to open doors like the raptors from \" jurassic park \" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in \" anaconda . \" \\nsome of the attack sequences are straight out of \" jaws \" and \" alien . \" \\na scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of \" alien resurrection . \" \\nthere\\'s even a jet ski chase like \" hard rain . \" \\nand the list goes on . \\nwatching \" deep rising \" \\'s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy . \\nwilliams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn\\'t believable . \\nan interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as \" goldeneye \" \\'s killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o\\'connor , as finnegan\\'s mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast . \\ndjimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december\\'s \" amistad , \" pops up in a brief part . \\nhe needs to stay away from the water . \\nthe movie\\'s final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur . \\nas if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn\\'t bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you\\'re really asking for it ) , \" deep rising \" is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot . \\nand since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn\\'t out of the question . \\n',\n"," b\"an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material . \\nthe story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation . \\ninstead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . \\nupon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days . \\nof course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries . \\nin what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) . \\nrosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando . \\ni can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips . \\nbut maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread . \\nganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world . \\nthroughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character . \\nthe gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up . \\ndirector and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor . \\nthe cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job . \\nthe reason ? \\nmimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories . \\nthe novice detective's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny . \\nunfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone . \\nrosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt . \\nit's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie . \\nseveral details in fernando's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies . \\nearly in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door . \\nafter that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past . \\nit seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any . \\nbut there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips . \\nthe movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve . . . \\nor if our passports weren't missing . \\n\",\n"," b'plot : a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side . \\nbut this new guy is not like all the others , he\\'s got ambition , he\\'s got goals and he loves everything he sees about being the number one gangster . \\nviolence , lots of swearing and betrayals ensue . \\ncritique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the \" great \" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending . \\nhere\\'s yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . \\nokay , so it\\'s not entirely new , but it\\'s definitely original when all put together as done here . \\nthe thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place . \\nit\\'s 1968 and these dudes are looking good ! \\nyes , it\\'s all about the suits , fellas . . . the \\nitalian shoes , the cufflinks , the ties and the birds ( that\\'s ladies , for those uninitiated ) hanging around you . \\nhere are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place . \\nbut that\\'s not the basis of this movie . \\nthe basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other . \\nyou know how there are always these \" hanger-on \" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ? \\nwell , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that \\nis , their boss . \\nso all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence . \\nbut this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package . \\nof course , director paul mcguigan isn\\'t trying to be guy ritchie here , and doesn\\'t over-stylize his presentation , jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix . \\nnope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this . \\nthe first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he\\'s attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty ! \\n ( \" look into my eyes ! \" ) \\nin fact , the last time that i\\'ve seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers\\' miller\\'s crossing . \\nscary shite . \\nbut there\\'s an ever better scene than that in this film . \\nthis one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man\\'s point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that\\'s right , he \" does \" the guy in his underwear ) . \\nthat scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) . \\nbut the flick\\'s not perfect . \\nin fact , i didn\\'t mind malcolm mcdowell\\'s voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot . \\nall he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( \" . . . so \\ni opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . \" -it\\'s \\nlike , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! ! \\noverdone . ) . \\ni also didn\\'t quite \" buy \" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it\\'s supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ? \\ni mean , c\\'mon . . . it\\'s 30 years , man ! ! \\ni don\\'t know , somehow it didn\\'t work all that well for me . \\nbut one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot . \\nforget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell\\'s narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film\\'s stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis . \\nincidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it\\'s the real deal ! \\nnote : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time .

a child\\'s father will play to the family audience as well . \\nrest assured , the whole enchilada is wrapped up with a fart joke . \\nwhile far less offensive than the farrelly\\'s last effort \" me , myself and irene , \" that film at least spiked some comic highs with jim carrey\\'s hijinx . \\n \" osmosis jones \" will probably be ok for the kids , but the farrellys playing for the family

will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup . \\naudience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film\\'s sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out . \\nsomewhere out there , maybe there\\'s a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere\\'s dubious charms , but i\\'m not among them . \\ni sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it\\'s hard to understand why the rights were optioned . \\nsphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create . \\nwith expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) , \\nsomething this bad can\\'t help but look even worse . \\nthe last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year\\'s batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received . \\nsphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron\\'s the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon . \\nscience and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere\\'s first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences . \\nattempts at characterization fall apart . \\nintelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel . \\nspecial effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness . \\nbut all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful . \\nthis is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect . \\ni left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film . \\nthere is some promise , but it\\'s all in the setup . \\nwe\\'re introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered . \\nwhen one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee . \\non the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission . \\ntogether , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact . \\nfor a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation . \\nthe overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities . \\nthen , right around the one-hour mark ( that\\'s the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever\\'s left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous . \\nthis might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things \" exciting . \" \\nadditionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who\\'s more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don\\'t develop much of a rooting interest . \\nit makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience . \\nwhat about that a-list cast ? \\nnot surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn\\'t a person ; he\\'s a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue . \\ndustin hoffman isn\\'t lively or particularly good -- it\\'s ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) . \\nsharon stone and peter coyote are both flat . \\ntheir characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective . \\nthen there\\'s queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count . \\ni like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere\\'s lengthy pre-production phase ) . \\nif that\\'s the case , forgiveness is granted . \\ni\\'m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) . \\neven if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton\\'s credit as a producer disallows him absolution . \\nhe was a willing participant in a creative travesty . \\nno wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year\\'s cinematic wasteland . \\nit deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap . \\n',\n"," b'in china in 1982 i turned the

uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes . \\ngreg is playing a game he does not understand , in a league he is new to . \\nbut perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law . \\nthis film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship . \\nit has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films . \\nbut the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived . \\ntoo many coincidences in the story work against greg . \\nthe script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky . \\ncertainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could , but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him . \\nthere is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy . \\ncertainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written . \\nthe main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro\\'s performance . \\ndeniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can . \\nthe little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities . \\nbut we do not really see much of that digging . \\nben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen . \\nit is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen . \\nbut her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that . \\nrandy newman has written a playful score . \\nin the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before . \\nthere is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s . \\npresumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody\\'s imagination . \\nhumor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment . \\nbut this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me

serving as southern militiamen in the civil war , jesse james ( farrell ) , his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , and his pal cole younger ( scott caan ) lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended . \\nbut trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) and his cronies rollin parker ( terry o'quinn ) and allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads . \\nthe jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing

who's the most popular cowboy in the gang , and who ought to go on mtv's total request live . \\nthey rob numerous banks with identical interiors , always with the kindest of hearts , strutting in

farrell . \\nafter a great job in tigerland , farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds . \\nand his american accent rivals richard gere's irish accent in the jackal . \\ncombined with feeling like bonanza : the teen years , this homogenized production ( toned down to get the ever-popular pg-13 rating ) gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring . \\nthe unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged , sucking out any energy left in the film . \\nnot to mention : the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws . \\ninstead , the movie is full of old , outrageous tales about the wild

have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of

are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro . \\nas for his script -- well , i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience . \\nif you haven\\'t yet figured it out , that is not saying much . \\nco-star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story . \\nthe fact of the matter is that griffin , whose

much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour , money talks ) in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips . \\nhe spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done ) , and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie . \\nand indeed , i laughed at a few stand-up scenes here , but from a feature-length movie i expect more . \\nfoolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters . \\nevery scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke (

something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loudly for the occasion \" huh ? \" ) after getting slightly upset with his wife . \\nbelieve me when i

right this time ( last year\\'s \" simon birch , \" loosely based on his \" a prayer for owen meaney , \" was a big-screen example of irving handled sub-standardly ) ; the author appears fleetingly as a stationmaster here . \\nrachel portman , a composer of such sweet and lyrical tenderness , provides a score that\\'s absolutely right for the project--sweet , lyrical , and tender . \\nthere\\'s

\\ntwo low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense . \\neach has made well over $100 million in north america , based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising . \\nif a film\\'s box office take were based primarily on its quality , stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected , for it is as scary , if not scarier than the other two . \\nwriter/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment , the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit . \\nthe story gets going after tom witzky ( bacon ) , an average blue-collar dad , gets hypnotized by his wife maggie\\'s ( erbe ) sister lisa ( douglas ) at a party . \\nwhile the hypnosis goes as expected to the party-goers , it triggers something in tom\\'s head . \\nthings begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum , for example ) , and he fights to stay in control of his own senses . \\nwhere these experiences take tom , maggie and their son jake ( cope ) , who tom thinks might have some answers , is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you . \\ndavid koepp keeps the action localized ; the majority of the action takes place at tom\\'s house or just down the street . \\nby keeping things at home , koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues ( montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc . ) . \\nunfortunately , the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity . \\nhumour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting . \\nseveral tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes . \\nalso , there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved , though to mention them would be to give too much away . \\nkevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably . \\nhis total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable , as are the reactions from his wife maggie . \\nkathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most \" wife who can no longer handle her husband \" parts . \\nwhile it is still a supporting role , her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls \" a private club that i\\'m not invited to \" , where they whisper about things all day long . \\nas jake , zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense , but gets less screen time . \\nboth children manage the same trick , making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are . \\nfans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes . \\nit combines the dread of blair , a creepy closed-in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast , specifically bacon , to give the fall its first genuine scary film . \\nif only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more , this could have been one of the year\\'s best . \\n',\n"," b'when the

commander \" might rake in some dough , but be warned : the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation . \\n',\n"," b'the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it\\'s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo . \\nwe soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo\\'s ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control . \\nhowever , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade . \\nno sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins . \\nit seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas\\'s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time . \\nwe\\'re the fans , not the freaks . \\nwe won\\'t go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won\\'t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we\\'re throwing down . \\nall right , stop looking at me like that . \\nwe have been faithfully and patiently waiting . \\nwaiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll . \\nyou see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah . \\nunfortunately , it is not our savior . \\nfor weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good . \\nanything less and it\\'ll be the biggest disappointment of the century . \\ni didn\\'t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn\\'t , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking . \\ncharacter development is virtually nonexistent . \\nwith the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film\\'s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions . \\nnone seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all . \\ncontrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala . \\njar jar\\'s life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) . \\nhis speech mannerisms are so \" cute-ified \" that i couldn\\'t understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting . \\nhis head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as \" deep doo doo , \" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport . \\ntherein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors . \\nin star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a \" wretched hive of scum and villainy . \" \\nin the phantom menace , we get doo doo . \\nthe films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story \" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . \" \\nthis film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it\\'s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience . \\nperhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it\\'s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play . \\ni liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? \\nthe race would have been even more exciting without the distraction . \\nthis aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me . \\ni suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? \\ndidn\\'t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? \\ndidn\\'t the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? \\nof course they did , and it\\'s only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . \\none aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects . \\nthe people at lucas\\'s industrial light and magic , the world\\'s premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage . \\nsome of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation\\'s robot army and jar jar\\'s countrymen . \\nthe space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer . \\nthis , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today . \\njohn williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can . \\nhis music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately . \\nsince this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . \\nas a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin . \\nit would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . \\none of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film\\'s release . \\nin spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn\\'t have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant . \\nhe has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . \\nwith that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment . \\nlucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout . \\nhowever , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection . \\noddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body\\'s cells . \\nthis only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . \\ndon\\'t let me mislead you too far . \\nthe phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film . \\nit contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends . \\nit\\'s just that when held up to it\\'s predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales . \\n',\n"," b'it is with hesitance that i call \" apocalypse now \" a masterpiece . \\ncertainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970\\'s . \\nthe plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad\\'s \" heart of darkness \" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war . \\n \" apocalypse \" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history . \\nthe plot is fairly simple . \\ncaptain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty . \\nhis mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) \" with extreme prejudice \" . \\nalong the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies . \\nwillard\\' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz\\' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives . \\nwillard\\'s experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending . \\nthe movie is visually breathtaking . \\nthe battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate . \\nthe collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening . \\nthe vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie . \\nthe journey to kurtz\\' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character . \\nthe most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission . \\nit is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie . \\nthe scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne . \\nthe narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz . \\ncoppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like \" saving private ryan \" on lsd . \\nthe film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution . \\nthe problems come when the film slows down . \\none of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess . \\nthe dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film . \\nthe true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound . \\nthe film slows down to a drag . \\nsheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received . \\nbrando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic . \\nthe scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief . \\nsheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told . \\nthe entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations . \\ngranted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion . \\nbrando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? \\nthere are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene . \\nthere are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending . \\nthe finest scene at the end is sheen\\'s escape , and his entrace into the temple . \\nhis rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film . \\nyet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done . \\nthe psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good . \\nit is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man\\'s mental stamina during bouts of war . \\nbut one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for . \\nthere is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding . \\n',\n"," b'to put it bluntly , ed wood would have been proud of this . \\na totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay . \\nalso , a beautifully anti-climactic ending . \\nnot to say it didn\\'t look intriguing when i saw the previews . \\nso much for truth in advertising . \\nroland emmerich , who\\'s later \" independence day \" would look like \" the 400 blows \" compared to this , co-writed and directed this inane sci-fi film which uses the cliche of there being some connection between eqypt and aliens . \\nin a useless opening sequence , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it . \\nit wouldn\\'t be till present day ( \\'94 ) till they would actually figure it out . \\nthey\\'re decipherer ? \\na slightly-neurotic scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( james spader , doing his best outside of erotic thrillers and some indy fare ) who\\'s life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word . \\nwhy do they use him to decipher what no one else could ? \\nso there is a hokey ending ! \\nduh ! \\nhe figures it out in about a minute . \\nyea . \\nand then they get a suicidal colonel or something , \" jack \" o\\'neill ( kurt russel , with his wyat earp locks in the beginning then a flat-top that would make howie long snap into a fetal position ) . \\nwhy a suicidal colonel ? \\nfor the ending ! \\nyou\\'ll get the hang of this . \\nthey open the stargate , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad . \\nafter an overdone special effects thing , they\\'re . . . inside a goddam pyramid . \\nso they went to egypt , right ? \\nwrong . \\nthey\\'re on another planet that was filmed in egypt . \\nthey discover a cilvilization ruled by ra , the sun god ( the androginous jaye davidson , with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white with asthma ) , and there are fights , explosions and a kiss between two people . \\nyea . \\nalso melodrama , stupidity , hokey scenes and a bizarre language . \\nan anti-climactic ending ends with stupid lines ( \" say hello to king tut , asswhole ! \" \\n- the quintessential line , lemme tell ya ) and some convenient pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-character development . \\nby the end , you just wanna go home and watch , i don\\'t know , the \" outer limits \" or something . \\nthe script\\'s terrible . \\nthe special effects are okay , but nothing great . \\nthe story\\'s so weak that it\\'s almost opaque . \\nthe whole experience just isn\\'t worth it unless you\\'re so bored that you\\'d consider watching a \" full house \" marathon . . . or \\nthis . \\ni\\'d pick this , obviously , but still , it\\'s just not fun at all . \\nand i can\\'t wait for it to premier on mst3k . \\n',\n"," b'for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess . \\nin the early to mid 1400\\'s , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman . \\nthe church was a dismally dark and oppressive place . \\nfrance was involved in \" the hundred years war \" against england . \\nthere was no strong political leadership in the country . \\nmorale was low , there being little hope for the future . \\nit was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing \" voices \" and seeing \" visions . \" \\nconvinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him . \\nthe message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown . \\nhe does . . . \\nand she does . \\nthen , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors . \\ndirector luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material . \\nthe inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable . \\nhis biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role . \\nms . jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse . \\nif looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant . \\nsince it isn\\'t , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part . \\nher joan is unbalanced , \" inspiring \" the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed . \\njohn malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii . \\nan easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death . \\nfaye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin\\'s mother-in-law and chief advisor . \\nthe army under joan\\'s command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers . \\nthe one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan\\'s arrival . \\ntrying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan\\'s insistence on following her \" visions . \" \\ndustin hoffman ( sphere ) has a small inhuman role as joan\\'s conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial . \\ndressed like cloaked monk , he leads her to doubt herself and her \" revelations . \" \\nas well she should . \\nscriptures do speak of revelation . \\ngod , via his gift of holy spirit , is able to communicate to men . \\nthree of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation . \\nthey are : word of knowledge , word of wisdom , and discerning of spirits . \\neven the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his \" holy men . . . \\nwho spake as they were moved by holy spirit ( i . e . \\nby revelation . ) \" \\nbut the scriptures also caution us : \\n \" beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of god : because many false prophets are gone out into the world . \" \\n1 john 4 : 1 [kjv] \\njoan\\'s end , ( being burned at the stake at the age of 19 ) , the frenzy ( mob rule ) and blood lust her inspiration wrought , and the death , pain , or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one . \\nwhile her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality , she was , as others have been before and since , misled by the spiritual master of deception . \\nas a messenger , she was quite effective . \\nshe was just confused as to whose message she was carrying . \\n',\n"," b'after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel\\'s wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america . \\nmuriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia . \\nshe is often the target of her father\\'s frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage . \\nher self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired . \\nafter her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel\\'s wedding unfolds from there . \\ntoni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted . \\ncollette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character . \\nshe has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance . \\ncollette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene . \\nmuriel\\'s father , bill \" the battler \" heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer . \\nwhile chumming around with young fans and crowing \\'you can\\'t beat progress\\' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments . \\nrachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel\\'s cheeky new friend in the film . \\nshe has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen . \\nmuriel\\'s tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan\\'s scripting \\nmuriel\\'s wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm . \\nhogan\\'s use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile . \\nhogan\\'s script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel\\'s earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her . \\nthe glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch . \\nmuriel\\'s wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan . \\non my four star scale , i give muriel\\'s wedding three stars . \\n',\n"," b'often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray . \\nmany elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply don\\'t convert into a solid work . \\nalthough a setting is never established , it becomes apparent . \\nthe film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day . \\nthe community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last . \\nover time , the people have taken to themselves . \\nthe town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger . \\nso what happens when a \" tourist \" ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ? \\nhe sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock . \\nit is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby . \\nwhen he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years . \\nit is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages . \\nthe woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town\\'s police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance\\'s involvement with this musician . \\nthe rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray . \\nit features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk . \\ntechnically , this film is a nightmare . \\nthe music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt . \\nthe lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases . \\nthis translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words . \\nin addition , the pace of the film seems uneven . \\nit opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one\\'s patience . \\nthe film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark . \\nthere was , however , potential for this film . \\nit is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re-unification of people . \\nthese are all topics that could easily fill a movie . \\nperhaps , if there were no freak show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end . \\nmost importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren\\'t such a bore . \\nuntil then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out \" mommy \" while he wanders astray in a park . \\n',\n"," b'has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears ? \\nnineteen years and two mighty ducks later , the formula is still going strong . \\npolice academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small-town deputy sheriff corralled into co-coaching the school\\'s hastily formed soccer team . \\nhis partner-in-crime is the new british \" exchange teacher \" ( olivia d\\'abo ) , a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested , outer-city audience is to teach them something neat . \\nlike soccer . \\nmost of the good-natured gags are of the fast-motion variety , such as runaway cows and out-of-control lawnmowers . \\nkids will laugh at the occasional belching bit , while their parents peacefully doze beside them . \\nother than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed , what\\'s missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy . \\ninstead of a peppy pop score , which would arguably work to better effect , most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else . \\ncomedy needs music . \\njust watch any old bugs bunny short . \\nthe marx brothers knew it . \\nmel brooks knows it . \\nunfortunately , the current trend is to \" overscore . \" \\nlush strings and booming brass in every scene , at every moment . \\nremember the simple strains of bizet\\'s \" habanera \" in the original bad news bears ? \\nthese days , it\\'s usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path . \\nmuch like adding frosting to already frosted cake . \\nan awfully big adventure ======================== \\nthe reteaming of director mike newell and star hugh grant is about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings and a funeral . \\ntheir second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern ( georgina cates ) struggling to survive in post-w . w . ii \\nliverpool . \\nhugh plays the gay director , an * extremely * unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months . \\nbleak make-up and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle into . \\nan awful adventure is not without * some * rewards , tho . \\nthe peter pan subtext is intriguing . \\nas is the diverse ensemble cast that includes peter firth , alan rickman , and prunella scales . \\nbasil ! \\ndevil in a blue dress ===================== \\nthe comparisons to chinatown are easy enough , except for the fact that this film isn\\'t nearly as gripping . \\nwriter/director carl franklin ( one false move ) is the force behind this accomplished-but-stiff adaptation of walter mosley\\'s crime novel . \\ndenzel washington is as sturdy as ever , but he\\'s burdened with a miscast supporting cast . \\ntom sizemore and scene-stealer don cheadle are both fine . \\nthe problems start with jennifer beales , who never registers as the plot\\'s femme fatale . \\nshe\\'s a pretty face and nothing more . \\nalso underweight are maury chaykin and terry kinney . \\nthey play opposing mayoral candidates in 1948 los angeles and neither actor commands enough authority to stifle giggles . \\njohn huston , we miss you ! \\nfine period detail and a strong sense of humor are a plus . \\nthey help to overcome a pace that\\'s too polite for mosley\\'s jazzy , swingin\\' story . \\nsteal big , steal little ======================= \\ni can\\'t say much about this one . \\ndirector andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers ( andy garcia ) with opposing moral codes . \\nthey\\'re fighting over their adoptive mother\\'s estate , a 40 , 000-acre ranch worth millions and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers . \\nso many different plots are trying to come together--feuding brothers , reconciling husbands , loan-shark hired hitmen--that you have to admire the director\\'s ambition . \\ntoo bad that almost every single person or plot-line is out of sync . \\nthat is , with the exception of alan arkin . \\nhe\\'s the best thing in a movie that--despite the work of four credited writers-- * still * manages to waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers , kevin mccarthy , and joe pantolinao . \\nand what the heck does that title mean ? \\n',\n"," b'robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style . \\noverwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) . \\nso when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it\\'s in trouble . \\njakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically \" uplifting \" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn\\'t realize it . \\nwilliams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii . \\none night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment . \\njakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast . \\nthe announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant \" heil hitler ! \" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob\\'s ghetto . \\nliberation ! he thinks . \\nthe next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along . \\nsoon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death . \\nthis is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate . \\nthe danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger . \\nin a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home . \\napparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear . \\nhe and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning . \\nthe moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine . \\nbut jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false . \\nsuch hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren\\'t met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope . \\nthat\\'s the film\\'s biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false . \\nit\\'s never moving because it doesn\\'t give us anything to be moved by . \\njakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing . \\nrobin williams doesn\\'t inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent . \\nhe is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless . \\nnot since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn\\'t the robin williams we know and love . \\nin good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it . \\nhere , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor . \\njakob the liar will be compared with last year\\'s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a \" holocaust comedy \" . \\nit\\'s not a comedy . \\nit tries , sometimes , but it rarely works . \\nis it a melodrama ? \\na war movie ? \\na character study ? \\nno , no , and no . \\njakob the liar is the kind of movie that can\\'t be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts . \\n',\n"," b\"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle . \\ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \\nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \\ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \\nfurthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \\nand , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \\nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \\nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \\nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \\nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \\nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \\nthe film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \\ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \\nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \\nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \\non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \\none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \\nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \\nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \\nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \\nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \\njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \\nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover . \\nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \\ntarzan continues this trend . \\nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act . \\nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \\ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \\nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \\nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \\nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \\nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \\nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \\nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \\nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \\nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \\nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \\n\",\n"," b'\\'bicentennial man\\' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment . \\nchris columbus , the director who gave you \" mrs . doubtfire \" , plays on sentimental strings and mushy dialogue to make his point . \\nbased on the short story by isaac asimov , it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human , which as you can imagine is very difficult . \\nstarting in a not too distant future the film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them with the house and children . \\nsoon this robot , called andrew ( robin williams ) shows abilities that makes his owner mr . martin ( sam neill ) very curious . \\nandrew is interested in art and music , he \" enjoys \" making clocks , which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions . \\nit shows out that because of a small failure in the \" electrical circuits \" and \" positronic brain \" andrew has accidentally gained a soul . \\nthis makes him unique and his evil creators worried . \\nthen mr . martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn\\'t programmed to do . \\nsoon andrew wants to leave the house in pursuit of freedom , destiny and love . \\nthis film can be described as a disney version of blade runner , a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of science fiction . \\never since that film , the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy . \\nwhat makes us human ? \\nthe thoughts ? \\nthe emotions ? \\nis it possible to become human ? \\nat what point can we say to a robot \" now you are one of us \" ? \\nthese are very tough questions that require a serious and thurral approach . \\nit is obvious that columbus didn\\'t take them very seriously . \\nwhen you think about it , this film is not really meditating on the question \" when is a robot no longer a machine , but a human being ? \" , but tells a story about racial discrimination and lack of understanding . \\nandrew is so complex and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being , and only the society has troubles with it . \\nin other words , it is as far from reality as from the academy awards . \\nfurther more , there are other annoying problems . \\nto this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now . \\nthis has not been done for obvious reasons , because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that they lack the knowledge and imagination to perform such a difficult task . \\ncolumbus is the first to have crossed that line . \\nthe result is , as you might imagine , primitive , unrealistic and incredibly disappointing effort . \\nthe world is simply frozen in time . \\nneither the society , fashion , culture or values have changed over 200 years . \\nmom is still working at the kitchen , doing the dishes . \\nwhen you think back to the late 17th century and then compare it to the world we live in today , you\\'ll see a slightly bigger difference . \\ni am not saying that everything should change . \\nit is unlikely that the human rights will change , but it\\'s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science , technology and fashion . \\ni suppose it\\'s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale , but it\\'s really hard . \\nrobin williams is hidden behind c and speaking in a robotic way . \\nas always he does a decent job , as does sam neill . \\nbut it doesn\\'t really matter . \\nit is the sentimentality and length that turns this picture into a tiresome experience . \\npretty much like last year\\'s \" meet joe black \" , this is a primitive and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor and professionalism that it doesn\\'t deserve . \\ngreat actors and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten . \\nwhen isaac asimov wrote this story , the future seemed far away and magical . \\neverything seemed possible . \\nnow is the future of asimov\\'s time , and we know that it is not as magical and perfect as it seemed a long time ago . \\nfor the same reasons that the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne\\'s \" 20 000 leagues under the sea \" , so can\\'t we accept this story as a potential reality . \\nlet us hope that next year\\'s \" a . i . \" \\nwill be more rewarding . \\n',\n"," b' \" say , any of you know how to madison ? \" \\n--- brad \" asshole \" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show . \\nthe story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend . \\nin the early 70\\'s , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o\\'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design . \\nthe result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england . \\nthe play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 . \\nthe film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . . \\nand immediately tanked at the box office . \\nwhether it was because fox wasn\\'t quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn\\'t quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop . \\nit seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters . \\na year later , something entirely strange and magical happened . \\nprints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film . \\nthis new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time . \\nword quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show\\'s life as the ultimate cult film was born . \\nfor the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton . \\nbrad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed . \\nthey plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home . \\nremembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance . \\nthe castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) . \\nfrank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) . \\nas rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter\\'s mad schemes . \\nlittle do any of them know that the doctor\\'s handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o\\'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth . \\ngoing back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has . \\nif i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don\\'t think i would have known what to make of it either . \\nfor all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film . \\nby the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o\\'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on . \\nwhen i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity . \\nit goes without saying that the \" time warp \" is the most popular song in the film . \\neven people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song . \\nwhat those who haven\\'t seen the movie don\\'t know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment . \\nmy personal favorite is \" over at the frankenstein place \" , but \" dammit janet \" is also maddeningly catchy . \\ntim curry\\'s vocals on the rocking tune \" sweet transvestite \" need to be heard to be believed . \\nthe finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . . \\nfrightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( \" rose tint my world \" , \" don\\'t dream it \" , \" wild and untamed thing \" , and \" i\\'m going home \" ) , all of which are immensely singable . \\nthe film\\'s true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though . \\ndespite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn\\'t have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show . \\nwatching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don\\'t mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) . \\nnote : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton . \\nthe two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own . \\no\\'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original . \\n25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world . \\nas a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) . \\nif you are one of those people who can\\'t get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites . \\nin an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it\\'ll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all . \\nthe film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) . \\nthe film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called \" superheroes \" . \\nfor ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen . \\noriginally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) . \\nmost reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced . \\nthe film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o\\'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) . \\nthe two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) . \\nfox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments . \\nthe first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is . \\nthe second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show . \\nmost of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter . \\nthe final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote . \\nwhen selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world . \\nonce the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off . \\nthe first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player . \\nthere is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don\\'t know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don\\'t know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff\\'s story lab . \\nlinks to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc . \\nthe second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras . \\nformer lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the \" behind the music : rocky horror \" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung \" hot patootie \" . \\nthe \" behind the music \" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o\\'brien\\'s jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot . \\nthere are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o\\'brien , and meat loaf interviews . \\nas far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here . \\none of which is just the \" superheroes \" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called \" once in a while \" . \\na series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick\\'s pants ) . \\nfor the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here . \\nrounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is \" a different sort of jaws \" ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for \" toucha toucha touch me \" and \" sweet transvestite \" ) . \\nfox\\'s special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( \" you\\'re lucky . . . \\ni\\'m lucky . . . \\nhe\\'s lucky . . . \\nwe\\'re all lucky ! \" ) . \\nit\\'s not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format . \\nas with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want . \\ni raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition . \\n[r] \\n',\n"," b'i didn\\'t come into city of angels expecting greatness . \\ni\\'ve never seen wim wenders\\' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based . \\nthen again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold . \\nunfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them . \\nthe plot , for those that couldn\\'t tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) . \\nof course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye . \\ntheir love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human . \\nusing this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection . \\nthe first half of the movie succeeds on most points . \\ncage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn\\'t know feelings so can\\'t really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions . \\nunfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive . \\nas maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right . \\nher beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning . \\nlikewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film . \\nwhen the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel . \\nthe beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel . \\nthe film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie . \\nthe grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel\\'s eyes . \\nthe movie devolves into an examination of how seth can\\'t feel the world or , more importantly , he can\\'t feel maggie : he can\\'t smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats . \\nthis change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth\\'s intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears . \\nif he wants maggie so badly , then why doesn\\'t her just make the leap and become human ? \\nafter all , what\\'s so great about being an angel ? \\nsure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what\\'s that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ? \\nand from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it\\'s all downhill . \\nthe philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience\\'s hankie . \\nit\\'s the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film . \\ni feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level . \\ni came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing . \\ni could go on longer , but i don\\'t want to \" ruin \" the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on . \\ncity of angels , then , is a paradox . \\nit\\'s a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea . \\nall these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up . \\n',\n"," b'if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton-chop sideburns to each side of his head , spoken with a thick irish accent , and tried his damnedest to play it straight , he wouldn\\'t have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in \" i went down . \" \\ngleeson , who\\'s not dissimilar to the late \" saturday night live \" alumnus in terms of physical attributes , plays a character named bunny kelly in this delightful irish film . \\nbunny is sent to county cork to \" retrieve \" one frank grogan for an irish gangster called tom french ( well dressed like all good gangsters should be and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle ) . \\nbunny is to accompany git hynes ( peter mcdonald ) , recently released from prison and obligated to tom for disfiguring one of his cronies . \\nthat tom french is a mean bollocks . \\nhe wants frank back . \\nand a small matter of some ? 25 , 000 that tom\\'s wife was supposed to have given to frank . \\nfor this he won\\'t break anyone\\'s thumbs . \\nmaybe . \\ninventively and engagingly written by conor mcpherson and directed by paddy breathnach , \" i went down \" follows the trials and tribulations of git and bunny as they knock around peat bogs , dimly-lit pubs , and seedy hostelries trying to stay alive and out of trouble . \\nmcdonald is a newcomer and a promising one at that , but gleeson has been in over a dozen movies , most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent on hilarity , \" the butcher boy . \" \\neven if you can\\'t comprehend half of what they\\'re saying , gleeson and mcdonald together make \" i went down \" a trip worth taking . \\nthe film is in many ways reminiscent of another \" little \" independent feature , 1991\\'s \" highway 61 . \" \\nthat film , too , was a road movie and it shares the same kind of wry dialogue and humorous situations as mcpherson\\'s tale : whimsical observations on life , carefully-crafted vignettes , deadpan conversational asides , and scenes that\\'ll make you laugh out loud . \\nwitness the episode in which our good-natured protagonists bind frank ( played by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed , leaving him with only the tv remote for company . \\nthat sequence alone is on a par with satan locking himself out of his car in \" highway 61 . \" \\nwhat\\'s also charming about \" i went down \" is how the relationship between buddy and git develops . \\ntheir trip becomes an education for both of them , but the way it\\'s handled is neither sappy nor labored . \\nthe only thing in the film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation , via flashbacks , of the relationship between frank and tom . \\nit\\'s a little too hollywood , and what makes \" i went down \" so refreshing is the fact that it rarely panders to traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies . \\nsure it\\'s gritty--make that grubby--but it\\'s also pretty goofy . \\nalthough \" i went down \" emphasizes the comedic elements of dis-organized crime , there are a couple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping with the subject matter . \\ndon\\'t let these deter you , though ; \" i went down \" is a little gem . \\nit\\'s only playing at one philadelphia-area theater--and i suspect it won\\'t be there for long--so catch it while you can . \\n',\n"," b'the premise of this movie is , well , pretty far-fetched . \\ntom berenger plays shale , a mercenary who is temporarily out of work ( those fools at the cia have denied his existence just because he and his buddies botched a job in cuba ) . \\nfortunately , his girl friend ( diane venora ) , a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami , gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student , creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher . \\nnot telling his girl friend , who might object on pedagogical grounds , he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself ( from yale , harvard , princeton , et al ) and begins his tenure as a high school teacher . \\nthe students ( junkies , drug dealers , gang members , sleazy sluts , ice-pick wielders . . . you \\nget the picture ) don\\'t really take to him right away , so he hits one in the face with a can and breaks a few fingers . \\nthis gets their attention to a certain extent , so he tells them the story of the vietnam war : \" see , some homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from the south . \" \\noh yeah , now they can dig it ; the problem is just that nobody ever explained it properly before . \\nbut wait ! \\nthere are drugs being dealt in the school itself ! \\nand behind the whole scheme , in cahoots with the head gang , the kod ( no , not \" cod \" , but \" knights of destruction \" . . . really ! ) , is none other than . . . the \\nupright , ex-cop principal , played by the forgotten ghostbuster , ernie hudson ! \\nso shale does what any good teacher would do . \\nhe gets his buddies together , they gather together a bunch of bazookas and other major weapons , explosives , and cool stuff like that , and they have a big showdown against the drug dealers and kod at the high school . \\nok , so the premise is not just far-fetched , it\\'s downright dumb . \\nif this were a hong kong action comedy , we might just accept it , but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun . \\noh , it has its moments ; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge ( really huge ) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses ? \\nand to be fair , it is almost never really boring , as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story . \\nbut over all , this is pretty much a made-for-tv movie with more ( and bigger ) explosions and more foul language . \\nin fact , it reminded me of \" miami vice \" without the production values , babes in skimpy bikinis , and pastels . \\nif you can sneak into the theater without paying , go for it . \\notherwise , wait for video . \\nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * *

between , leaning strongly towards the latter . \\nit\\'s certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be . \\nbut i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams \" i\\'m important ! \" \\nmccourt\\'s book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900\\'s , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us . \\nas he comments , \" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . \" \\nin ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela\\'s mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman . \\nshe helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job . \\npositions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking . \\nmeanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires . \\ntwo of frank\\'s brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition . \\nas if the poverty and the suffering weren\\'t intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further . \\ni imagine this doesn\\'t sound like much of a plot . \\nthat\\'s probably because it isn\\'t one . \\nthese are people . \\nthis is their story . \\ndirector alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela\\'s ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting . \\nthough the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue . \\nsupplementing parker\\'s able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners . \\ncarlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character . \\nwe empathize with the guy , but we don\\'t like or admire him . \\nemily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance . \\nit is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats . \\nalso worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film\\'s superb poster . \\nit is breen\\'s first feature film and he\\'s extraordinary as young frank . \\nnot unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character\\'s soul through breen\\'s sad eyes . \\non the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela\\'s ashes is a more decisive editor . \\nwhile gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage . \\nthe first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process . \\nthings pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary . \\n * spoiler warning ! \\nskip next paragraph if in suspense ! * \\nthe film\\'s final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america . \\nwhat , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ? \\nhis mother doesn\\'t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . \\ni haven\\'t read the book , but i\\'m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i\\'m suspicious . \\nanother thing that\\'s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i\\'m sure , is also explained in the memoir . \\nif seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela\\'s ashes stands tall . \\ndespite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder . \\n',\n"," b'some movies i should just skip . \\nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . \\ntrue , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it\\'s a cartoon . \\nbut it\\'s a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . \\nbut my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? \\nturns out i was right , mostly . \\ninspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . \\nat first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . \\nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where \" formula \" isn\\'t just business , it\\'s a way of life . \\nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . \\nin some parts you can just hear them saying \" more zany ! \\ni want more zany here -- and -- here . \" \\n \" let\\'s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . \\ni want the audience squirming in their seats . \" \\n \" ok , that\\'s fine , but i want you to add bug guts . \" \\n \" what does this scene do ? \\ncharacter depth ? \\nbut where\\'s the zaniness ? \\ni don\\'t see zany here . \\nif you can\\'t make it zany , cut it ! \" \\nthe latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . \\nmichelle ( who plays penny , gadget\\'s niece ) shines in every scene she\\'s in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . \\nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . \\ndabney coleman\\'s comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . \\ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . \\nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the \" gidget bitch from hell \" town mayor . \\noteri\\'s overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon\\'s own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn\\'t poking fun at our fair town . \\nor , maybe all career politicians are like that . \\ni must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . \\nhe appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . \\nrupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . \\njoely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . \\nher performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . \\nd . l . hughley plays the shuckin\\'-and-jivin\\' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . \\nthe dialog is . . . let\\'s face it , it\\'s pretty bad . \\nthe tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . \\na lot of the lines ( especially hughley\\'s ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . \\nabout three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . \\ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really \" battles \" ) with the evil gadget . \\npenny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . \\nlet me rage here just for a minute . \\nmichelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . \\nshe\\'s utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . \\nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . \\nthe film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . \\ninspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it\\'s a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . \\nprobably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . \\nthe \" evil sidekick support group \" is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it\\'s onscreen . \\nall in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . \\ni wonder if disney uses the revenues for it\\'s generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . \\nbut if true , why ? \\nif they\\'re trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . \\n',\n"," b'eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights . \\nas the movie\\'s writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails . \\nbut at the same time , he\\'ll receive all of the credit if it succeeds . \\nshould you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy\\'s risky gamble ? \\nwell , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy . \\nhere\\'s what murphy thinks : \" i think the audience is expecting a good time . \\nthey gonna get sexy . \\nthey gonna get funny . \\nthey gonna get drama . \\nthey gonna get all of that . \\ni think it\\'s the best movie i\\'ve done \" ( paramount radio network ) . \\nhere\\'s what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor\\'s career ( i haven\\'t seen best defense ) . \\nand guess who\\'s to blame ? ! \\nthe movie\\'s problem is not murphy\\'s direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film . \\nno , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled . \\nmurphy\\'s awful script is the culprit . \\nlet\\'s count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : \\n ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture . \\nyes , he even outdoes his own work in raw . \\npractically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word . \\nand after 15 minutes , it gets irritating . \\n ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast . \\nrichard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes . \\neach of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle . \\n ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men . \\nmurphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there . \\nbut when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it\\'s another matter altogether . \\nyou\\'re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff . \\nfor instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach . \\nand he shoots jasmine guy in the head . \\nthis is a mean-spirited movie , folks ! \\nlovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn\\'t have any scenes with murphy . \\nthank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer . \\n ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date . \\nthe loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film . \\nmurphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality . \\nsometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair . \\n ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip-off of the sting . \\nif you\\'re going to make another sting movie , you\\'ve got to do something original . \\nmurphy\\'s tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula . \\n ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering . \\nyou know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped . \\n ( 7 ) murphy\\'s idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life . \\nfor what ? \\nfor shooting reese\\'s little toe off ! \\nneedless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter . \\nin all fairness , however , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie . \\ndanny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take . \\naiello stands out in the large , ensemble cast : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties ) . \\naiello\\'s zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice . \\nanother bright spot is arsenio hall , who has a hilarious , show-stopping cameo as a cry-baby gangster ; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy . \\nin fact , hall\\'s ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie . \\nunfortunately , his character is completely irrelevant to the plot ; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role . \\nof course , i\\'ve already mentioned that i didn\\'t care for murphy\\'s character , but i have to admit that i did love his neckties . \\nthey are simply spectacular--almost worth the price of admission . \\n',\n"," b'i\\'ve always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable - death and taxes . \\noddly , i\\'ve never given much thought to either of the two . \\nmaybe if i did , at least i\\'d stop getting collection notices from uncle sam . \\nyes , let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping , hold on to all my receipts , and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties . \\nit seems that the issue of death may not be so different , at least envisioned here in this film . \\nas this tender love story goes , if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die , you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty . \\nthe dreams , wishes , and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true . \\nfor those who die with a burdened soul , however , they wind up in that other place . \\nchris and annie ( a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra ) seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer . \\ntheir love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable . \\nbut tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annie\\'s happiness . \\nand when chris dies after a terrible car accident , she commits suicide - a tortured soul who blames herself . \\ndespair is perhaps the greatest sin , and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity . \\nchris , on the other hand , has made it to heaven , and upon learning of annie\\'s fate , he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare . \\nthis film brims with imagination , containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell . \\nit seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares . \\nit\\'s shape and look is as infinite as our imagination . \\nas chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous , he also begins to learn more about himself . \\ncertain questions baffle him at first . \\nwhy does his home in heaven ooze with paint ? \\nwhat is the significance of the asian stewardess ? \\nwhy does he have an all-too-willing guide ( cuba gooding , jr . ) to help him find annie ? \\nbut as he slowly begins to realize the answers , it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie . \\n \" dreams \" is both visually and tellingly beautiful . \\nalas , i have one regret . \\nthe movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed , but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying . \\nit seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish , but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments . \\nhowever , your eyes will still well up with tears and you\\'ll find lots to savor . \\nthe storytelling is purposeful and well constructed . \\nthe journey is imaginative . \\nand i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film . \\n',\n"," b'hey , i\\'ve got a great idea for a movie ! \\nok , here it is : we\\'ll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so ! \\nwhat\\'s that ? \\nsounds too boring ? \\nok , how about this then : we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours , but half of them are angry looks and half of them are \" i\\'m in pain ! \" \\nlooks ! \\nwhat\\'s that ? \\nthat still doesn\\'t sound funny to you ? \\nhow about if we through in some \" ewwwww ! \" \\nlooks ? \\nstill not funny ? \\nif you answered \" no , that doesn\\'t sound funny \" , then ( ding ding ding ! ) \\nyou\\'re absolutely correct ! \\nfor richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple ( played by tim allen and kirstie alley ) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant ( wayne knight , best know as newman on tv\\'s \" seinfeld \" ) gets them in trouble for tax evasion . \\nwhat ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell . \\nwhat makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs . \\n . \\n . \\nnamely , talent ! \\nbacking up , the married couple is brad and caroline sexton ( allen and alley ) , a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else , but in reality are on the brink of divorce . \\njust as their marriage seems to be hanging from it\\'s final thread , brad discovers that his accountant , bob lachman ( knight ) , has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton\\'s names . \\nthe irs catches on , but since everything points back to the sexton\\'s and not lachman , there is nothing much to do . \\n . \\n . \\nexcept run away and join an amish community . \\nfirst time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle-out-loud moments , and even some decent laughs here and * way * over there , but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you\\'ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn . \\nalley is absolutely unwatchable , and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade ( which , i inform you , was total b . s . ) . \\nallen and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons , nor are they very convincing as an amish couple ! \\nthis entire movie is one bad ill-conceived notion that should have been curtailed from the very beginning ! \\nthe amish in this movie are also flimsy and unconvincing . \\nit\\'s such a trite , stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast ( noticing that they\\'re all predominantly tv figures ) were probably the only ones they could get ! \\nbryan spicer\\'s directing doesn\\'t help one bit , either . \\nin fact , listing spicer\\'s filmography ( which includes the first \" power rangers \" movie and the big screen adaption of mchale\\'s navy ) is more of an insult than a r ? sum ? ! \\nnow that i\\'ve pretty much run for richer or poorer into the ground , i will let you in on the best thing about it . \\nit bumped seven films up a notch on my \" worst of \" 1997 movie list . \\nthat\\'s right , thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for the year\\'s worst , six films are now not seemingly as bad , and a smile like yours , previously inhabiting the number ten spot , now doesn\\'t have to suffer the ridicule of making my bottom ten list . \\nif you look at it in that respect , for richer or poorer will end up making someone happy after all ! \\n',\n"," b'look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future . \\nsome sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence . \\n>from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different . \\nperhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact . \\nmaybe that\\'s where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ? \\nfilm makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that\\'s why there\\'s no shortage of movies about this subject . \\nthe best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance . \\nthese themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red . \\nhowever , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life . \\nin his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : \" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we\\'re faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we\\'re completely unaware . \" \\nwhile this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra\\'s it\\'s a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths . \\nthe \" road not taken \" approach isn\\'t just a plot device , either . \\nwriter/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train . \\nthe audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family . \\nas her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals . \\nthat woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit . \\none day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day . \\nthe scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform . \\nin scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station . \\non board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty . \\nminutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . \\nin scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging . \\nshe doesn\\'t meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry\\'s infidelity . \\njuxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there . \\non one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience . \\nbut , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill . \\none of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less . \\nit shouldn\\'t come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid . \\npaltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout . \\nshe plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man . \\njohn hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable . \\njohn lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland\\'s troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer . \\nonly jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place . \\nher attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it\\'s occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element . \\none member of the supporting cast deserves special notice . \\ndouglas mcferran , who plays gerry\\'s best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he\\'s in . \\npart of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie . \\non one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy . \\non another occasion , while laughing at gerry\\'s plight with the women in his life , he comments , \" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . \" \\nbut it\\'s not all in the dialogue . \\nmcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy . \\nthis is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb . \\nthe script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole . \\nsliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however . \\nfor those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time . \\n',\n"," b\"well , what are you going to expect ? \\nit's a movie about a big snake that eats people . \\nthat's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more . \\ninstead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too . \\nanaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river . \\nled by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives . \\nalong the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda . \\nto simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide . \\nif this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is . \\nat the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now . \\ni expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing . \\ncale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help . \\nthis minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake . \\nhowever , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle . \\nmost bad characters are either annoying or stupid . \\nin this movie , they're both . \\nsince this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for . \\nyou're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else . \\nor maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else . \\nat times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake . \\nthere are no standout performances here . \\neveryone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters . \\neven voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason . \\nno matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway . \\nin most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real . \\nhowever , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences . \\nsometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast . \\nit catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud . \\nthen there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly . \\nabsolutely ridiculous . \\na testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is . \\nin a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther . \\nthe anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out . \\neeeewwwww . \\nabove and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed . \\nin films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained . \\nif the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them . \\nto show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown . \\nin a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown . \\nwhen i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger . \\nthis one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe . \\nno such luck . \\nokay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut . \\n\",\n"," b' \" america\\'s sweethearts \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn\\'t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . \\nalmost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting \" comic relief \" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) . \\ncrystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \\n \" america\\'s sweethearts \" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . \\nit\\'s a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . \\nby the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . \\njohn cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . \\nof the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled \" time over time , \" are far from rosy . \\nwhile eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen\\'s solo films have tanked . \\nto make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a \" visionary \" who purchased the unabomber\\'s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . \\ndesperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . \\nlee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . \\nhe enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen\\'s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . \\nwhat lee doesn\\'t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . \\npress junkets are a haven for control freaks . \\nstudios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . \\ngenerally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . \\nthe next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . \\nevery 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . \\nthe atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . \\nrepresentatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . \\nthey get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . \\nthe \" reporters \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . \\nplacing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . \\nthe junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . \\nfor most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . \\nwhen they do deal with journalists , the \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters \" premise is de-clawed . \\ngwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . \\nlee certainly isn\\'t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . \\nis the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? \\nhell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . \\nall of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn\\'t matter because any publicity is good publicity . \\nand thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . \\nso what about the cast ? \\njulia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . \\ncatherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . \\nby casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on \" comic relief \" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . \\nin supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed \" too broad . \" \\nseth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . \\ncome to think of it , \" little to work with \" is the operative phrase for this movie . \\nas a hollywood satire , \" america\\'s sweethearts \" is toothless . \\nas a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . \\nsuch a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . \\nhad it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been \" much ado about nothing . \" \\n',\n"," b\"it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller . \\nsome people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may . \\nboth those films were tense exercises in chills . \\nthe two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer . \\nbut that was 1962 and 1964 respectively . \\nfor most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed . \\neach of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot . \\nthey had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay . \\nthe thrills all came from the plot . \\nronin is like a film made by another man . \\nsomewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it . \\nwe get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure . \\nthe film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai . \\nwhen a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west . \\nif you miss the opening , do not worry . \\nthis film will explain again what a ronin is . \\nsam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin . \\nhe is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer . \\nhe clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france . \\nsam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case . \\ndierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case . \\nsam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) . \\nalso along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) . \\nthe group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise . \\ntheir only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team . \\nthe story is not very easy to follow . \\nit is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom . \\nsomehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case . \\nsome very good actors are involved in this film . \\none wonders what they saw in the script . \\nthe characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers . \\nthey know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed . \\nby the end of the film we never really got to know anybody . \\nmaybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create . \\nin addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) . \\nas a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy . \\nunfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it . \\ni rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\nnon-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin . \\nalso one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet . \\nthis is the first blow of the 47 ronin . \\n\",\n"," b'plot : this movie takes place over one day . \\nit\\'s a rookie cop\\'s narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran . \\nthe rookie doesn\\'t know much about \" street justice \" , so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the \" real world \" . \\nhow even cops like themselves have to \" bend the rules \" and \" break the law \" every now and then , in order to catch the really bad guys . \\ncritique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board , some ups , some downs and a thrilling ending , despite a couple of small flaws . \\ni really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place . \\nthe film gets right into the \" dirty \" side of , well . . . the \\ndirt on the streets , and proceeds to teach the rookie cop ( and us , the audience ) how things really work down there . \\nof course , we\\'re receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time , but the things he seems to be doing aren\\'t exactly on the up-and-up either . \\nand therein , lies the fun of the film . \\ndo you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ? \\nwell , as the film moves along , we\\'re given two points of view in respect to this predicament , and to me , both sides made sense at some point or another . \\nand you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that , the director , who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades . \\nhawke , first off , because he rarely plays these \" commercial \" roles but does so perfectly here , with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top . \\nand denzel , well , what can you say about mr . washington that hasn\\'t already been said before ? \\nhe comes through as per his usual high-level style here , and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent , of which , i personally would like to see more . \\nhe\\'s nice , he\\'s not so nice , he\\'s smart , he\\'s not so smart , he\\'s caring and he\\'s a dog all the way . \\nthe few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay , we get it . . . you \\nhave to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people . . . move on ) and this one really major \" coincidence \" which involved a bathtub , that saved the day for one character , but seemed a little too \" convenient \" for my taste . \\ni also never really understood how washington\\'s character got out of a certain dire predicament , only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene . \\nbut obviously these small flaws didn\\'t taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama , a film that gets you right into the streets , into the nooks and the crannies , and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts . \\nsee it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself , see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen , and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie . \\nin fact , see it for the scene in which ethan hawke

`tarzan' beautiful to look at , easy to follow . \\nreview : disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story . \\nthe basic premise is the same as every other `tarzan' story : a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding ( or even noticing ) that he's human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends . \\nthe first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala ( voiced by glen close ) , a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism . \\nher mate , kerchak ( henriksen ) , is a mean , conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzan's extended family . \\nhe refuses to acknowledge tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz during the childhood scenes ) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous , wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts . \\ni have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and it's funny how the adults fail to comprehend this . \\nlater , as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full-grown man ( voiced by goldwyn ) , he is encounter by a party of three humans from england : jane porter ( driver ) , a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist , her father prof . archimedes q . porter ( voiced by nigel hawthorne ) who is also a scientist ; and their slick and cunning , yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton ( blessed ) . \\nit's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children's enjoyment . \\nsure there's a lot of cliche stuff here , like clayton's smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane ; the goofy supporting characters ( voiced by rosie o'donnell [in full brooklyn accent ! ] and wayne knight - `hello newman ! ' ) . \\nthere's also a lot of fun action such as tarzan's swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks . \\nit's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks ( those mcdonald's commercials really prove this point ) . \\nultimately , you get exactly out of `tarzan' what you expect . . . \\nand i mean that as a compliment , so have high expectations . \\npros : animation and sound are a feast for the senses , story is lighthearted , breezy and not dumbed-down , no stupid sing-along songs to get stuck in your head . \\ncons : surprisingly violent , should have been rated pg . \\nyoung children may not understand some of the more adult themes ( parents , be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way ) . \\nrunning

artists find the perfect patsy in harry ( woody harrelson ) - - an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post , tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye , has ill-timed fits of coughing , and fails at everything he does . \\nthe story is told from harry's point of view . \\nharry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn't drink . \\none day harry is approached by the con girl rhea ( elisabeth shue ) , who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn't smoke . \\nseduced , harry agrees to participate in a money-making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette ( chloe sevigny ) , the teenage daughter of a rich man . \\nturns out , it's all part of a needless , very puzzling , extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme ( it involves hiring special impersonators ) by two cons in order to fool harry , a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post . \\nwhen the 'kidnapped' odette is found dead , the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/murderer , and the police are hot on harry's trail . \\nharry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money . \\ncan he get out of this mess ? \\nopinion : palmetto is a long , uninteresting film with all the wrong feel . \\nhero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence . \\nthis farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof . \\nbut palmetto is played like a dark , serious , detective noir drama , and watching harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction . \\nthere's a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts , buttocks , short skirts , colored painted nails , and women's legs . \\neven when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema , you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue's breast forming a prominent foreground . \\ntowards the end , palmetto re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a confusing explanation involving impersonators , with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals' confession . \\nif you can imagine 'shemp' from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo 'lingerie suspense' thriller , that's how out of synch this movie feels . \\n\",\n"," b'america\\'s favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wife in \" bride of chucky , \" and their unholy matrimony is something old , nothing new . \\nthe burning question on the minds of most moviegoers , however , has nothing to do with nuptial specifics or even how the movie stacks up , but rather whether or not the duo gets down and dirty on their blood-soaked honeymoon . \\nthe answer is a sick-and-twisted yes - and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of some hot-enough-to-melt-rubber ( or at least singe it ) lovin\\' . \\nguess they\\'re anatomically correct . \\nchucky ( again voiced by brad dourif ) , of course , is the star of the \" child\\'s play \" series , a my buddy-type doll possessed by the spirit of a slain serial killer . \\nin \" bride , \" the plot ( heh ) picks up with his girlfriend tiffany ( jennifer tilly ) resurrecting chucky\\'s remains ( he was blown up at the end of \" child\\'s play 3 \" ) with the help of a black arts manual called \" voodoo for dummies . \" \\nsilly mortal . \\nbefore long , she\\'s also been reduced to shin-high figurine status , and the plastic incarnations of these one-time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies . \\nthe rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff and the chuckster stalk a young couple ( nick stabile and katherine heigl ) with conjugal plans of their own , leading them towards a new jersey grave where a magical , soul-transferring amulet allegedly lies in wait . \\nalong the way , our murderous barbie and ken go through post-marriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds - bicker , argue , kiss and make up . \\nbut when they squabble over who\\'s going to do the dishes , watch out . \\nhey , even faux people have got to work through their problems . \\ndirector ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy and stages an inventive scene or two , but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing . \\nwhen one of them charges , it\\'s nothing a good forward punt couldn\\'t take care of . \\nand when a climactic chase scene is needed , one of the dim-bulb protagonists must _pick_chucky_up_ so the demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint . \\nthrow in some silly casualties and a ridiculous ending ( will \" son of chucky \" be next ? ) and this is a bizarrely bad 89-minutes at the movies . \\nas is the thing to do in post- \" scream \" slasher cinema , don mancini\\'s screenplay slathers on the in-jokes and genre-parody . \\nbut little of the humor succeeds , proving self-reference can be completely worthless when it lacks bite . \\nto be fair , though , most of \" bride of chucky \" is on auto-pilot , so it\\'s not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of the film . \\nsimilarly shaky , the acting ranges from screeching camp to boring bland , the effects aren\\'t that special and the story is one big groaner . \\nhere\\'s hoping chucky and his entire clan - past , present and future - rest in peace . \\n',\n"," b'when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space . \\nit really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver . \\nbut weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet . \\naustin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i\\'ve had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks . \\nif all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ? \\n-- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex . \\neven more to this movie\\'s credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery . \\nthe original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody . \\nall of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america . \\nironically , powers\\' \" yeeeeah baby , yeah ! \" \\nhas almost become an icon of the late 90s . \\nthus another installment was inevitable , but it\\'s also undoubtedly welcome . \\nthe spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life . \\nit brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones . \\naustin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you\\'ll figure it out ) , which dr . evil ( meyers again ) has stolen . \\nhe enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr . evil yet again . \\nsurprisingly , the real star is dr . evil rather than austin . \\nhe gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie . \\nperhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately . \\ninstead of being the scheming , villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling , often sweet mad scientist wannabe . \\nthe spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that\\'s okay by me because the original left us wanting more . \\nby the time that one was over we haven\\'t had nearly our share of shag jokes , crude puns and powers\\' antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites . \\neven by its conclusions , i\\'m still not sure i\\'ve had my fill of bits like \" do you smoke after sex ? \" \\n \" i don\\'t know , baby , i never looked . \" \\nthis may seem awfully immature of me , but understand that the austin powers series , unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days , is genuinely funny . \\ni don\\'t know if i\\'ve ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious \" just the two of us \" rendition by dr . evil and his new miniature clone named \" mini-me \" . \\ni don\\'t have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort . \\nindeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did . \\nbut as far as i\\'m concerned , that is enough . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov &#137 ; \\n',\n"," b'godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the \" who cares about plot \" summer movie . \\na loose remake of the 1954 \" classic \" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin\\'s big-budget lizard-stomps-manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . \\nthe script isn\\'t just \" dumbed down , \" it\\'s lobotomized . \\ngodzilla lives and dies on special effects alone . \\npresumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster-instigated carnage . \\nthat\\'s not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they\\'re just not as readily susceptible . \\nthis is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors . \\nstargate was a financial success . \\nindependence day was a runaway hit . \\nand , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie-ins before it even opens , it\\'s virtually guaranteed at least $100 million . \\nnice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not-too-precocious grade school kid . \\ngodzilla isn\\'t completely without merit , although it is close . \\nthere\\'s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly . \\nfrankly , while the special effects are competent , they\\'re not all that stunning . \\nthere\\'s nothing new here ; it\\'s jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure . \\nmaybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer-generated visuals to the next level . \\ngodzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone . \\nthe imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity . \\n ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) \\nworst of all , godzilla isn\\'t even exciting . \\nwith the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn\\'t a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . \\neven the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking . \\nindependence day may have been dumb , but it was full of \" adrenaline moments \" capable of getting the audience involved in the action . \\nin this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking . \\nactually , part of the problem is that we\\'re never sure who we\\'re supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him . \\nthe plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply . \\nafter sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple . \\nhe does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway . \\nin the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams . \\non hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla . \\nin his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . \\nin nick\\'s words , godzilla is \" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . \" \\nas luck would have it , nick\\'s old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station . \\nalong with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla . \\nthen , just when the military has rejected nick\\'s theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment . \\ninstead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city . \\nunfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it\\'s becoming boring . \\nthe whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall . \\nhe could climb the empire state building . \\nat ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over . \\ngodzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor . \\nthere\\'s an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick\\'s last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel . \\nboth of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : \" ebert , \" the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and \" gene \" ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager . \\nebert\\'s re-election slogan is , not surprisingly , \" thumbs up for new york . \" \\nthe siskel/ebert stuff is amusing the first time it\\'s used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome . \\nand , although the \" characters \" don\\'t serve any real purpose , they keep popping up . \\ngodzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast . \\nthis is largely because emmerich doesn\\'t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard . \\nthat\\'s not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren\\'t capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren\\'t a-list names . \\nthen again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine . \\nmaria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief . \\nultimately , it doesn\\'t really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie . \\ntristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof . \\nit may also be word-of-mouth-proof . \\nthose who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . \\nso , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it\\'s like spitting into the wind . \\nemmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors . \\nit\\'s probably too much to hope that some day , movie-goers will wake up and realize that they\\'ve been had . \\n',\n"," b'when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects . \\nwhile i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don\\'t think that they are completely to blame for this movie\\'s failure . \\nit appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the \" unseen \" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny . \\nso special effects or not , if the story isn\\'t the least bit scary , you aren\\'t going to end up with a very frightening movie . \\nthe thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern . \\ndern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie . \\nas i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern\\'s caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast . \\nnever a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie . \\nliam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear . \\nhe decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion . \\nhe tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia . \\nand he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on . \\ncatherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects . \\nlike the original , taylor\\'s character is the star of the movie . \\nbut since she doesn\\'t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original . \\nand let\\'s face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones . \\ni\\'ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren\\'t in it . \\nbut the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets . \\nthey take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients . \\nthere really isn\\'t much of a story here . \\njust endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with . \\nand the special effects are great . \\nin many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere . \\nin other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the \" cool shots \" quota . \\nat no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe . \\nbut not scary . \\nthen we have the set . \\nwhen i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it . \\nbut it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route . \\nthis included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves . \\nwhat part did these rooms play in the story ? \\nabsolutely none . \\nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie . \\nthen we have the actors . \\nlili taylor has never been one of my favorites . \\nand when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark . \\ni have no idea why liam neeson took this role . \\nhe basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus . \\nhis character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him . \\ni have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman . \\nzeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words . \\nthe fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake . \\nall catherine has to do in this movie is look good . \\nfortunately that is something she does very well . \\nwhile she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy . \\nit\\'s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here . \\nany random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role . \\nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999\\'s horror movies , the blair witch project . \\nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares . \\nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film . \\nif the story sucks , it\\'s all downhill from there . \\nmy advice ? \\nif you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars . \\nif it\\'s scares you want , rent halloween . \\neither way , it\\'s probably in your best interests to skip the haunting . \\n',\n"," b'if anything , \" stigmata \" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another . \\nof the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst . \\ni suppose i should have seen this coming . \\nafter all , \" blair witch \" thoroughly creeped me out , \" sixth sense \" was mildly spooky , and then \" stir of echoes \" had its moments , but wasn\\'t anything i\\'d lose sleep over . \\nclearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping . \\nis it then any surprise that \" stigmata \" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ? \\nno , not really . \\npatricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother . \\nas it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest . \\nthe priest\\'s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue . \\nfather kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue . \\nhis investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ . \\nfather kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie\\' s story , considering she\\'s an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on . \\nhe eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church . \\nas it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a \" fifth gospel \" before they were excommunicated . \\nthe new rupert wainwright music video . \\n . \\n . \\ni mean film \" stigmata \" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse . \\nindeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it\\'s only interesting for about five minutes . \\ni\\'m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school . \\nhis camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing . \\nwhat this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , \" see ? \\nlook at what i can do ! \\ni\\'m an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . \" \\nmaybe then he\\'d explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) . \\nif there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn\\'t see it . \\njust when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever . \\narrrrrrrghhhh . \\n . \\n . \\nthen again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn\\'t bother me if \" stigmata \" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging . \\nthough wainwright\\'s vanity certainly doesn\\'t help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script . \\nwhere are plot continuity and character development when you need them ? \\ncase in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren\\'t given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her . \\nthe extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she\\'s kind of cute , so let\\'s start the bleeding ! \\nthe fact that she\\'s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn\\'t help , either . \\naccording to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ? \\ngo clubbing ! \\nsure , that makes sense . \\narquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . \\nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . \\neven though frankie page\\'s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . \\neven more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . \\nfather andrew\\'s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . \\nas for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i\\'ll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . \\ntrust me , i\\'m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . \\nwhat\\'s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . \\nfirst of all , the film doesn\\'t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \\nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \\nactually , i\\'m not sure what frankie was posessed by . \\nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \\nwhich one is it ? \\nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \\nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \\nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you\\'ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \\nthere\\'s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \\n \" stigmata\\'s \" religion is so off-base that it can\\'t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \\nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \\ni\\'m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\'t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . \\nit\\' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \\ni\\'m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \\nmaybe it\\'s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \\nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \\nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \\nso much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film\\'s ( many ) flaws . \\ni\\'m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \\nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \\nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it . \\n',\n"," b'this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . \\nthere are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood\\'s most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . \\nthis is the best we\\'ve seen from disney since \" beauty and the beast \" ( 1996 ) . \\nthis film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story . \\nin the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their \" lives \" . \\none day , andy broke woody\\'s arm off , while playing with him . \\nwoody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . \\nlater andy\\'s mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son\\'s room . \\nsince one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . \\nalthough his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . \\nthe cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , \" woody\\'s roundup . \" \\nif he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . \\nso , after andy\\'s mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it\\'s up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend . \\nand so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys . \\nthere are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) . \\nmeanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) . \\nthey offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan . \\nhe is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations . \\nthe problem is , if woody escapes from al\\'s clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage . \\na real effort is made in the technical department . \\nthe animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the \" cinematography \" is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression . \\nlighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie\\'s remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on \" jurassic park \" and \" star wars \" . \\nthe film ends with the \" failed takes \" , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv . \\nthese outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film . \\nbut what in the end makes \" toy story 2 \" a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation . \\nit is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself . \\nit is not difficult to predict that \" toy story 2 \" would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected . \\nunexpected because the first film wasn\\'t much more than a demonstration of special effects . \\nbut mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn\\'t produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs . \\nbut here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . \\nthis is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation . \\noff course , this is not \" antz \" , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you\\'ll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . \\nwhether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . \\nmy choice would probably be \" the iron giant \" , but ( along side with \" american pie \" ) this is the comedy of the year . \\ni almost lost my hopes for disney , but \" toy story 2 \" proves that disney hasn\\'t lost their ability to entertain . \\n',\n"," b'for more than a decade , anjelica huston has been one of america\\'s finest actresses . \\nin her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison\\'s largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well . \\nthe film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina . \\nthrough voice-over ( narration done by laura dern ) , we find that she nearly didn\\'t survive birth , as her single mother anney , played by jennifer jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident . \\nthat\\'s just the beginning of her troubles . \\nbone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate , a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come . \\nanney meets and weds lyle , a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident . \\nanney\\'s brother earle , played by michael rooker , introduces her to glen , played by ron eldard , a co-worker at the mill . \\nglen , the black sheep of a wealthy family ( \" when are you gonna make your daddy proud ? \\ni\\'ll tell you when - never ! \" \\nhe\\'s told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper . \\nwhen anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour . \\nthings turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment . \\nwhile set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today\\'s society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other . \\nthe real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance . \\nher work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone\\'s performance stands up well . \\nleigh\\'s performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she\\'s not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character\\'s moods in and out of explosive rage . \\none can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away . \\nof the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker\\'s performance . \\nthere\\'s a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance . \\nstill , it cannot be denied that anne meredith\\'s screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power . \\nhuston\\'s direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone . \\nher sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective . \\nhuston\\'s talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile . \\nthe film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience . \\nperhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant , but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing . \\n',\n"," b\"a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel . \\nwell , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller . \\nanyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man . \\nthe original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it . \\nno more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable . \\nthe story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist . \\nthe captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) . \\nto add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks . \\nsome of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less . \\nnone of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control . \\nthis makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable . \\nall the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects . \\nthe waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves . \\nit looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish . \\nalso on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ? \\nif this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ? \\nregardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it . \\nas to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about . \\nthe actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles . \\nhaving the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe . \\nwatching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely . \\nthe one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening . \\nso if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed . \\nas the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect . \\nthis movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv . \\n\",\n"," b' \" an intimate , character-driven drama about a troubled youth at a crossroads in his life , \" read the press notes for _reach_the_rock_ .

sergeant phil quinn ( william sadler ) takes him in , and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and sneak-ins where robin slips out of his jail cell , breaks a window

\\nthe stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny . \\n ( for example , no one can recognize capt . amazing in his secret identity because he\\'s wearing glasses . ) \\nthe fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprisingly the only gags that work . \\nthe cast tries hard , especially hank azaria , whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume , but the script is just too lame to run . \\n',\n"," b'it\\'s almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter\\'s follow-up to 1997\\'s the tango lesson , the man who cried . \\nthe gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn\\'t even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be . \\nricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold . \\nblanchett\\'s lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks . \\nco-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe . \\nthe actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film\\'s lead rather than her dull companion . \\nimportant historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film\\'s little conflict . \\nobviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues . \\nthe man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film\\'s close . \\nthere are forced messages here and there : \" go forward ; always go forward , \" lola preaches to suzie ; there\\'s romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler\\'s nazis , the gypsy cesar ( johnny depp , who , like ricci , barely gets to speak ) ; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it ; and at the core of all these devices lies suzie\\'s desire to travel to america , where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago . \\nthe film\\'s main problem is that potter isn\\'t skilled enough to tell the epic-sized story of suzie . \\nthe time period\\'s instability , the conflicting social classes , the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life : serving as both writer and director , potter throws in some of each , but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any . \\nby the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater . \\nthe film\\'s falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely ; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ? \\ncontrastingly , in its moving final scene , the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film . \\nalthough it\\'s apparent that potter can\\'t grasp what she reaches , i\\'m puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place . \\nricci\\'s suzie is meant to be the film\\'s core : from the extended flashback at the film\\'s beginning to the quickly drawn ending , everything seen in the film , in some way , relates to her . \\nso why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals ? \\nthe character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble , but not present enough for the film to be ricci\\'s . \\nthe almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny\\'s beautiful cinematography that renders the film\\'s various locations wonderfully . \\nalso worthy of note are lindy hemming\\'s costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely . \\nand then there\\'s the music . \\nfrom minute one to minute ninety-seven , there\\'s hardly a moment when the wavering , skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don\\'t undercut the action ; the notes stricken both overwhelm ( particularly john turturro , portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio , whose money and reputation catch lola\\'s interest ) and accompany ( oftentimes , the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film\\'s characters and reinforce that state ) . \\npotter obviously cares much about each and every musical note ; unfortunately , the same effort isn\\'t given towards ( almost ) everything else . \\n',\n"," b'after the recent animated debacles of , \" a rugrats movie , \" and \" a bug\\'s life , \" i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks\\' other insect film from october , \" antz . \" \\ni hated that movie , and yet , it is so much better than these latest two excursions . \\n \" a bug\\'s life , \" is the second animated insect film in the last two months , and i hoped for the best , considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixar\\'s last film , 1995\\'s \" toy story , \" but in no way does , \" a bug\\'s life , \" even remotely match up to that . \\nflik ( david foley ) , an ant , who along with his many comrades , has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest , only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers , led by hopper ( kevin spacey ) . \\nflik , however , feels all alone and unwanted in the world , especially after he accidentally loses all of their food , and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other season\\'s load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees . \\nbanished from ant island , flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out , but through a misunderstanding , returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs , including a walking stick ( david hyde pierce ) , a dung beetle ( brad garrett ) , a gypsy moth ( madeline kahn ) , a male ladybug ( denis leary ) , and a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) . \\n \" a bug\\'s life , \" has one thing going for it . \\nonly one thing . \\nwith its glorious , bright colors , the computer-generated animation is a spectacle to look at . \\nthe film itself , unfortunately , is a lifeless , unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of , \" toy story . \" \\nthe characters in , \" a bug\\'s life , \" are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality , other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny one-liners . \\nthe thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes , and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout , and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time-filler . \\nafter giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year , i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them , but then i realized this is just not so . \\ni still adore almost all of the older disney films , and many of the newer ones , such as 1989\\'s , \" the little mermaid , \" 1991\\'s , \" beauty and the beast , \" 1993\\'s , \" the nightmare before christmas , \" and yes , 1995\\'s , \" toy story . \" \\nmaybe this has just been a bad year for children\\'s films , and hopefully , the upcoming , \" the prince of egypt , \" will not be a disappointment . \\nas for , \" a bug\\'s life , \" i did not enjoy anything about it . \\nnot the story , not the characters , and not even the voiceover work , which was far more lively in , \" antz . \" \\n \" a bug\\'s life , \" goes down as yet another failure for disney , and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture , \" i\\'ll be home for christmas . \" \\n',\n"," b'it\\'s now the anniversary of the slayings of

. \\nbut was this contest too good to be true ? \\nthe resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed like love boat rejects . \\nmeanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin . \\nthis presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island . \\neventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms . \\nas you might have guessed , somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook .

, but her friends chalk it up to paranoia . \\nbut the body count soon starts to rise , and for julie , it\\'s going to be the worst vacation of her life . \\nthe funny ( yes , i used the word \\'funny\\' ) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling and giggling ( maybe it was my giggling ) than i heard screaming . \\nthis movie boils down to a mindless slashfest that never

incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido . \\ni secretly wished for him to get filleted . \\ndid he get \\'hooked\\' ? \\nwell , let\\'s just say that if he didn\\'t , i would give this

playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then \" bully \" \\'s for you . \\nbased on jim schutze\\'s novelization of a true-life event , \" bully \" charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood . \\nthe film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers . \\nin the hands of controversial director larry clark ( \" kids \" ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker\\'s pornographic proclivities . \\nin terms of the incident and what provoked it , \" bully \" stirs up nothing new . \\nthe high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane . \\nthe bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he doesn\\'t exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department . \\nhe hounds and harries and humiliates his \" best friend \" marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty\\'s girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn\\'t care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby . \\nsimply remove him from the equation . \\nmarty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off . \\nthere\\'s no remorse--the next day they\\'re talking about it as openly as a homework assignment . \\nthey did it because they wanted to , and because they could . \\nwhat\\'s most troubling about the film , however , isn\\'t the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material . \\nnot only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in \" bully \" but there\\'s also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it . \\ngratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in \" there\\'s something about mary \" look like the height of subtlety ! ) . \\nclark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about . \\nthe stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera . \\nthe conclusion of \" bully \" offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime . \\nit\\'s a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it\\'s infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it . \\n \" bully \" aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death . \\n',\n"," b'when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies . \\nfrom the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they\\'re not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don\\'t run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say \" i\\'ll be right back , \" etc . ) . \\nwhen i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie . \\nhow hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies . \\nwas this wes craven\\'s remedy from making \" real \" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ? \\nit just seemed cheap to me . \\nthen i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude . \\nscream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it\\'s also a pretty scary movie . \\nif you\\'ve seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen . \\nthis is part of the fun of watching scream . \\nthe movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers . \\nto those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film . \\nthere\\'s nothing wrong with that misjudgment though . \\ni have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics . \\ntheir opinions on the film were so different but both very positive . \\nfrom these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories . \\nfilms that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream . \\nthe low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990\\'s . \\nthis influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson\\'s creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors . \\nscream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson . \\nwithin the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie . \\nmainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you\\'re dead meat ) . \\nnot only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors . \\nthe script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction . \\nin this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience\\'s satisfaction and amusement . \\ni hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies . \\ni will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream\\'s perfect subtlety . \\nhowever my last gut feeling about this stuff , scream , was dead wrong . . . \\nso who knows . \\n',\n"," b' * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling\\'s latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once . \\nwhen she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it\\'s impossible to tell whether she\\'s being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically . \\nsuch is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button . \\nthis fear of drama soured me on fast times . . . , look who\\'s talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu . \\nhas anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari\\'s dora ? \\nattired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger . \\nthe mechanics of loser\\'s tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes . \\nthey become walking wardrobes . \\nsmall-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter\\'s cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn\\'t scream \" shemp \" ( the lame stooge ) wig louder . \\nhe has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam . \\nthough they\\'re not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her . \\n ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged . \\ndora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions . \\nunfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . ) \\nwhen paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) . \\nalthough paul\\'s already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott . \\nshe\\'s thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul\\'s to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( \" cabaret \" ) , and just when paul\\'s got in his head that she\\'s starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott\\'s live-in girlfriend . \\ncue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er . . . \\n ( aside : simon & garfunkel\\'s \" parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme \" should never have been allowed in another motion picture . ) \\nheckerling has a lot in common with nora \" you\\'ve got mail \" ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong-willed women . \\nmen continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she\\'s cheerily redecorating his apartment . \\n ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . ) \\ngoth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them . \\nheckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling\\'s social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes . \\n ( consider , too , that dora is the film\\'s sole female principal . ) \\nnot that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn\\'t . \\nthat is her hallmark . \\n ( --- for more first-run , dvd , and

battlefield : earth \" , i was never interested in the previews , and never too terribly interested in the book , nor do i find scientology interesting , but after reading advanced reviews of how bad

seen , yes even worse than \" mr . magoo \" , \" blue in the face \" , or \" jaws : the revenge \" . \\nroger christianson whos credits include set direction , and art direction for such great films as \" alien \" and \" star wars \" , directs this film with such amateurism , that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb , that it\\'s quite depressing . \\nthe look of the film , is dark and drabby at times , but then bright and happy at other times . \\nthe sound is terrible , and has the worst surround sound effects i\\'ve heard . \\nthe acting is nothing , the dialogue poor , and the make-up effects hideous . \\nhere\\'s the so-called plot : earth 3000 . . . . man is a endangered species , while aliens from the planet psychlo ( the aliens are named psychlo . . . i \\nwonder why ? ! ) are invading earth , destined to put an end to those \" man-animals \" to an end , and destroy earth once and for all , of course we have our typical hero ( played terrible by barry pepper , who was great in a small role in 1999\\'s \" the green mile \" ) who is destined to go out , and save his planet ! \\none thing : he has to go up against , terl , the chief of security psychlo , who is played frankly , quite bad by john travolta , whom with dreadlocks , a big head , and green eyes just doesn\\'t work . \\nof course the sidekick to terl , is played by ( lol ! ! ) \\nforest whitaker , who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind . \\nour friendly human johnny ( barry pepper ) looks just as bad as well , with long scraggly hair . \\ni\\'m not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film , except just to say it\\'s terrible . \\neverything in this film is imcomprehinsable , from the make-up effects , which by the way aren\\'t good , to the phony looking special effects , everything in this film is faulted . \\nin fact i don\\'t remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time , or enjoying myself . \\nin fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed . \\nthroughout the entire 127 minute running time , i was dying , constantly looking at my watch , and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something , sadly it didn\\'t . \\nmy advice to hollywood : get new scripts , new acting classes , better directors and damnit , make films like american beauty more . \\n',\n"," b'adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy , the wedding singer . \\nunfortunately , that also has the effect of softening his edge . \\nhe\\'s nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one . \\nhe\\'s certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot . \\nthe year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia . \\nadam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits . \\nrobbie\\'s life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar . \\nhowever , things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) , a waitress at the hall . \\nshe\\'s the perfect woman , but for one small flaw : she\\'s engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king , glenn ( matthew glave ) . \\nso , most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love , and his attempts to stop the wedding . \\nas far as plots go , it\\'s a pretty thin and tired one . \\nto fill the gaps , the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia . \\nfrom boy george to michael jackson , from miami vice to dallas , from the first cds to the last rubik\\'s cubes , this film revels in all the minutiae . \\nand then there\\'s the music . . . \\nlearning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank , and romy and michele\\'s high school reunion , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow . \\nas a result , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives\\' eyes : the wedding singer vols . \\n2 , 3 , and 4 ! \\nwhile the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring , at least they distract you from the plot . \\nat least last year\\'s my best friend\\'s wedding stirred up the standard \" keep your true love from marrying someone else \" plot by making the rival a nice person . \\nhere , glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him . \\nbarrymore , on the other hand , is simply charming as julia . \\nwhich leaves us with adam sandler . \\nhe\\'s at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception ) . \\nwhen he\\'s in full nice-guy mode , he\\'s more pathetic than endearing . \\nthe film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz ) . \\nbut none of them work well at all . \\nbuscemi\\'s role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous . \\nlovitz , on the other hand , as a rival wedding singer , makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live , where he was actually funny . \\nthe only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film\\'s finale ( surprisingly , one of the only plot-related scenes which actually works . ) \\nadam sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man . \\nwhile he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer , the end result is no net gain . \\n',\n"," b\"if you thought baz luhrmann's radical take on _william_shakespeare's_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild , wait until what you see what tony award-winning stage director julie taymor ( _the_lion_king : _the_broadway_musical_ ) does to the bard's _titus_andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut . \\nwhile luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s florida , taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome--but places it in a surreal temporal limbo . \\nthe colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome , but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s , while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more '40s and '50s , and other garments are more gladiator-like . \\nas tamora , queen of goths ( jessica lange ) exacts revenge on roman general titus ( anthony hopkins ) for killing her eldest son , and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits , taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story's underlying themes . \\nhowever , the time convergence approach only works at times , for often it's just distracting , as in one scene where tamora's suviving sons ( matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers ) blow off steam playing video arcade games . \\ntaymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks , for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them . \\nshe is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist , the latter compliment encompassing all areas , makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments . \\nshe also has a sure way with actors ; hopkins' titus is at once tragic and horrifying , and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora . \\nthe clear standout of the cast , however , is harry lennix as aaron , a moor who is tamora's secret lover and a schemer in his own right . \\nlennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain . \\na great villain he indeed is , but to leave it at that isn't giving full justice to his powerful and multi-dimensional work . \\n_titus_ isn't a complete success , but it is never less than fascinating , and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice . \\n\",\n"," b'conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children\\'s items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made . \\nthat\\'s when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives . \\ncheck out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you\\'ll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks . \\nthere\\'s a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen . \\nboomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time . \\nthey\\'d like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore . \\nhollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them . \\ndirectors are zealous to put their

then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for . \\nsurrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times . \\nthe leather-clad rigg probably didn\\'t hurt the ratings either . \\nafter all it\\'s not a coincidence that you can\\'t pronounce her character\\'s name without \" appeal \" . \\nnow we\\'re in the nineties . \\nsteed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england\\'s weather . \\nthat\\'s about as much of a plot as we have . \\nthere\\'s some footage about a lot of other things that either don\\'t make sense or make even less sense . \\nwe get betrayal for some unknown reason . \\nevil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film . \\nremarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason . \\nthere\\'s a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone\\'s in it . \\nthe spy agency is run by a man called \" mother \" who is in a wheelchair and a woman named \" father \" who is blind . . . at \\nleast in some scenes . \\nthere\\'s probably a reason for all of this , but we\\'ll never know it . \\nmacnee makes an appearance of sorts . \\nhe is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing . \\na group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits . \\nat first it\\'s humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy . \\nthe movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner . \\nit feels like major portions of the film are missing . \\nthe storyline jumps rather than flows . \\nreportedly the film was re-cut several times . \\nthis is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing . \\nthere\\'s one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher . \\nother than that , the effects are second-rate . \\nthe weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes . \\nthurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn\\'t work . \\nshe looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there\\'s no spark . \\nfiennes fares even less well . \\nmacnee\\'s steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor . \\nfiennes\\' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town . \\neven connery , one of the greatest living actors , doesn\\'t have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes . \\nthe action scenes are difficult to follow . \\ndirector jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of \" diabolique \" ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn\\'t be . \\nthings happen , people move around , but even if , with the utmost effort , you were able to care about any of it , the scenes are bewildering . \\nthe primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads . \\nwitty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination . \\nadmittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film , but there\\'s no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever . \\none of emma peel\\'s first lines of dialog is \" rules are made to be broken . \" \\nit doesn\\'t get any better . \\nadvance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone . \\nthe release date was changed several times . \\nconnery refuses to promote the film . \\nthere was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers . \\nat least this way , they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out . \\nadmittedly i haven\\'t seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades . \\nmy guess is that it would be severely dated now . \\nno matter how antiquated it might be , there\\'s no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing . \\nthere\\'s no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie . \\nno reason at all . \\n',\n"," b'jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . \\nfrom time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . \\non the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis\\' king kong . \\nand , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . \\nhush is one such example . \\nlange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn\\'t such a prime example of motion picture tedium . \\nthe film opens , as many so-called \" psychological thrillers \" do , by posing as a light drama . \\nwe are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks\\' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . \\njackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . \\nthe moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . \\nsoon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . \\nonce that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . \\nas long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it\\'s a declaration of war . \\nhush has three very simple problems : it\\'s incredibly dumb , it\\'s incredibly boring , and it\\'s incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . \\nthis film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow\\'s bare buttocks . \\nfrankly , it\\'s embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange\\'s stature give a performance like this -- it\\'s like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . \\nmeanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . \\nas in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . \\nhere , it\\'s mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . \\nof course , since schaech\\'s character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it\\'s impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . \\nmaybe someone should ask him if he\\'s familiar with oedipus . \\nmartha is , of course , the evil one . \\nhow do we know she\\'s evil ? \\nshe smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . \\non the other hand , helen is a good girl . \\nthe evidence for this is that she\\'s nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . \\nthat\\'s about it for character development . \\nbeyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . \\nhowever , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . \\neither there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . \\nbefore the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . \\nviewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . \\ncheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . \\nmost entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren\\'t especially good . \\nfilms like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . \\nin general , however , they\\'re directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . \\nthat\\'s not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . \\nindeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid . \\n',\n"," b\"it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire . \\nusually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . \\nto qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat . \\nbut today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you . \\nby the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors . \\nnot in these times . \\nall you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade . \\nwithout sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity . \\nwhich brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half . \\nnot only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower . \\nwith all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims . \\nyou also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains . \\nblade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual . \\nthe plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost . \\nit's all hokum and nonsense , of course . \\nbut the filmmakers play it straight . \\nunfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings . \\nyou know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter . \\nanother tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero . \\nalso it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs . \\nhe must also be proficient in the martial arts . \\nwhy a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me . \\n ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . ) \\nwesley snipes is buff as blade . \\nhe growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey . \\nblade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill . \\nthis dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face . \\ntoday's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee . \\nthey are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes . \\nthey are more farcical than frightful . \\nthis whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening . \\n\",\n"," b'a movie that\\'s been as highly built up as the truman show , with reviews boasting , \" the film of the decade ! \" \\nand \" a breakthrough ! \" \\ncan only be leading up to letdown . \\nthat\\'s no doubt -- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makes you think you\\'re going in for the ride of your life , that you\\'ll end up changed on the other side , and you come out of the theater going , \" eh . . . \\n * that\\'s * what all the fuss was about ? \" \\nso , naturally , the truman show was building up to what was going to be a dissapointment . \\nand i convinced myself , as i nestled into my uncomfortable movie theater chair , actually to try not to enjoy it . \\nlet me tell you , that is an impossibilty . \\nthe truman show is truly \" the film of the decade \" and \" a breakthrough \" and more . \\nand you will come out changed on the other side . \\nsuch a movie comes around only once in a lifetime , where you find yourself feeling everything that the character is feeling , and this , friends , is it . \\njim carrey shows that he doesn\\'t need to talk out of his butt to entertain us ; that he can be as dramatic as any of hollywood\\'s leading men . \\nthe film has a difficult premise to tackle , trying to set us up thirty years into the \" truman show\\'s \" run , but tackle it it does , and perfectly . \\nwith flashbacks actually being flashbacks on the television show , you get the sense that you are viewing a * real * prime-time hit . \\nand the way the camera constantly takes the forms it would in the \" real \" truman show is clever and well-done . \\npeople , rejoice ! \\nthis is the first oscar-worthy film of not only this year , but of the last five years . \\nnot since \" schindler\\'s list \" has a movie captured human spirit and true despair so well . \\nthis is a classic in the making , and ( to borrow a line from esquire\\'s review ) it stars jim carrey . \\nnothing in his career to date and nothing he can do in the future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank ; mark my word . \\nfor , as i said , this is the movie of a lifetime and the role is of the same calibre . \\nforget special-effect ladden summer fodder . \\ndrop your romantic comedies in the trash . \\ntoss your thrillers and teen flicks on the pile . \\nyou need nothing

playing in a fancy , thx theater . \\nunfortunately , the theater was far more impressive than the movie , which absolutely stinks , much like a french lavatory . \\nworse , actually . \\nfire walk with me ( directed by lynch ) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read \" laura palmer\\'s secret diary . \" \\nfor \" twin peaks \" junkies , like me , the

feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland , oregon . \\nthe movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper . \\nlynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks , washington--one year later . \\nah , twin peaks : \" familiar territory , \" you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti\\'s distinctive musical score chimes in . \\nwrong ! \\nthe movie proves that you really can\\'t go home again , or at least lynch can\\'t . \\nonly about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie : leland palmer , bobby briggs , james , shelly , leo , the log lady and a few others--mostly in meaningless cameos . \\nthe rest of the \" twin peaks \" cast is nowhere to be seen , and consequently , lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv\\'s most enigmatic town . \\ncast members michael ontkean , sherilyn fenn , piper laurie , and richard beymer are sorely missed , not to mention lara flynn boyle , who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna . \\nthe movie concentrates solely on laura palmer ( sheryl lee ) as she suffers through drug abuse , prostitution , and incest , during her miserable last seven days on earth . \\nthe night of laura\\'s death , which is truly terrifying , is the film\\'s only remotely effective sequence . \\nwe finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james\\' motorcycle and ran into the woods

surprised about how well they were able to keep the laughs going for the virtually the whole film , with the exception of the ending . \\n ( which i won\\'t discuss for obvious reasons , but it\\'s not * that * bad . ) \\nstory : the plot was quite thin , but it really wasn\\'t that noticeable , because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in . \\nalot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots ! , in being very \" parodyish . \" \\n ( okay , bad term . ) \\nextremely witty throughout , although ( as in hot shots ) it got a bit repetitive in the middle . \\nacting : as in many comedies , the acting isn\\'t really * that * important . \\nhowever , myers turns in a good performance as wayne , playing the character perfectly , ( although i still liked him better back on much music , in a more \" canadian \" type of mode . ) \\ncarvey is okay as garth , but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne . \\ntia carrere is mediocre as cassandra , playing it very stilted . \\nlowe is fine as ben oliver , but is nothing to write home about . \\nwithout a doubt , this movie is mike myers all the way . \\ndirection : spheeris is a classic \" music \" movie director , making dudes , and decline of western civilization ii -- the metal years . \\n ( she also directed the boys next door , which is different , to say the least . ) \\nshe is very capable , knows how direct a comedy , the correct camera movements it instill laughs , etc . one of the better jobs i can remember for a comedy . \\noverall : i would suggest to anyone that likes snl\\'s skits to go see this film in the

writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as \\'anywhere but here . \\' \\nthere isn\\'t one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest . \\nit relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn\\'t figure it out for themselves . \\nif the film looks familiar , that is because \" the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) \" went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with . \\nalvin sargent\\'s script was weak and annoyingly claustral . \\nwayne wang\\'s ( \" the joy luck club \" ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn\\'t convey . \\npushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills . \\nthe daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life . \\nthe daqughter doesn\\'t even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can\\'t stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio . \\nso it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner . \\nadele\\'s dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn\\'t look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive . \\ndaughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there . \\nduring one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel . \\nwith the cop\\'s zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla . \\nduring their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t . s . \\neliot ( corbin allred ) reader . \\nbut the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional . \\nwhen she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn\\'t clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly . \\nthe film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams . \\ni guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother\\'s faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself . \\nmother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part . \\nbut mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her . \\nshe learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do . \\nthis of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom\\'s heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way . \\nthis was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing . \\n',\n"," b\"all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin . \\nin fact , the script was in development well before 1992 . \\nstill , the comparisons are inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference . \\nno , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting . \\nspeechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy . \\nspeechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davis ) meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep . \\nwhat neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate's speeches , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate . \\nat first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they let down their guard and become closer . \\nbut there are plent of obstacles in the way , including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics . \\nthe standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other . \\nscreenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism . \\nit's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work . \\npart of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already . \\nthere is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour . \\ninconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together . \\nthe problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass . \\ndavis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit . \\nin a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection . \\nfor the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines . \\nyou keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens . \\nperhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics . \\nthe setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for . \\nhe wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background . \\nit might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be . \\ni was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless . \\nbut while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper . \\non screen , it's still paper thin . \\n\",\n"," b'capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace . \\nthere is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . \\njohn carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 , that the new film comes off as his homage to himself . \\n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . \\njohn carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes . \\nfor a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make . \\nghosts of mars is called a horror movie , but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . \\nin addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars , carpenter would have grounds to sue . \\nthis film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness . \\nit is , in fact , surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way . \\nbut that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience . \\nghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 . \\nmars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear ( which is good for the film\\'s budget ) . \\nit is never mentioned , but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , again making it easier to film . \\nsociety has changed a bit by that time , but it has advanced surprisingly little . \\napparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control . \\nand from carpenter\\'s view , women have really made a mess of things . \\nsociety has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten . \\nthe basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony . \\ninstead of having the criminal \" napolean \" wilson , this film has the criminal \" desolation \" williams . \\ninstead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons the police face , well , ghosts of mars . \\nbecause the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , but they essentially behave as human savages , in another lapse of imagination . \\nthe story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback . \\nghosts of mars takes place entirely at night and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . \\ncarpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene , showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . \\nsadly what follows is not really up to the buildup . \\nthe terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss . \\nhis idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening and then prove to be just something boring . \\nthese are standard haunted house film shock effects that require no great talent to give the audience . \\nsomewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights . \\nwithin a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars .

straight out of hollywood\\'s vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies . \\nit was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie isn\\'t his own . \\nmel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he didn\\'t like the ending and had another director reshoot it . \\nwhat a crock . \\nif you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for . \\nwhy film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don\\'t like the ending . \\nyou\\'re fired . \\nlet\\'s get someone else to do it . \\n- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood . \\nthe end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized . \\nwhich is to say that it\\'s happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize . \\nin this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson\\'s prize is a blond and money . \\ni miss originality in film , i really do . \\ni think audiences are so starved for it that they\\'ll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original . \\npayback\\'s tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth . \\nwhile gibson\\'s character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn\\'t kill in front of children and protects his blond woman . \\nthere\\'s nothing bad about him - he\\'s a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life . \\nand gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a \" bad guy \" , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant . \\nthe story involves gibson being double-crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $70 , 000 . \\ngibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less . \\nhe makes a point of it that it\\'s strictly 70 grand . \\na real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay 25% interest . \\nthis idea is completely stretched out . \\ngibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with . \\nwhat i didn\\'t understand - this is the chicago mafia . \\n$70 , 000 is like spare change to them . \\nthey\\'d probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him . \\ni think they\\'d respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70 , 000 . \\nmaybe i\\'m being too hard on the movie . \\nperhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie . \\ni read roger ebert\\'s review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy . \\nthat\\'s why we\\'re allowed to root for him . \\nand it\\'s true - gibson walks the movie as if he\\'s smiling at a joke he just heard . \\nbut he\\'s wrong here . \\ni wanted a lee marvin or old-time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn\\'t a comic , just an ass kicker . \\nas a side note , i\\'ve just checked the internet movie database and discovered

into the on-line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can . \\n',\n"," b' \" practical magic , \" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one . \\nthe film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years . \\nat the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) . \\nswitch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she\\'s not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) . \\nwhen gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts\\' house . \\nadd to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of \" light-hearted whimsy , \" and you have a pretty good idea how messy \" practical magic \" is . \\nafter seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed . \\nit is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching . \\nit is not charming or entertaining in any way . \\nand then to top it off , we\\'ve got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian\\'s body . \\nwhatever . \\nthe characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character . \\nthere is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side . \\nno attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people . \\nthe same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way . \\nin fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines . \\ni should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the \" batman \" series with \" batman forever \" and \" batman and robin . \" \\n \" practical magic \" is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , \" addicted to love , \" with meg ryan and matthew broderick . \\ni disliked that movie quite a bit , but since \" practical magic \" is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is . \\ni\\'d tell him to quit while he\\'s ahead , but in these last two years , he\\'s ultimately already buried himself . \\n',\n"," b'the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany\\'s in which the audience is rooting for some sweet , vulnerable , irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness . \\nthe problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo ( played by sook-yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible . \\nalessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene . \\nthis is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland . \\none of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa . \\nshe also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window . \\nnext door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) . \\nhe sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating . \\nben gets emotionally involved with alessa . \\n ( as alessa so delicately puts it , \" we were bosom buddies , now we\\'re fuck buddies . \" ) \\nbut alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor . \\nthe real problem with the film seems to be helen lee\\'s inability to decide what she wants to be saying . \\nshe undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa . \\nalessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients . \\nthis appears to be a high profile and well-paid job . \\nwe are supposed to care about alessa\\'s feelings , but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father . \\nalessa cannot be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint . \\nthis is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double-zero . \\ni rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n"," b'based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst\\'s isolated island . \\nhowever , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst\\'s rumoured plunder . \\nwhile the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad\\'s characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself . \\nconrad\\'s heyst adheres religiously to his late father\\'s ways of detachment and isolation . \\nhis ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice . \\nthe struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe\\'s ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst . \\nwithout properly establishing the crucial details of heyst\\'s character , all that is left of conrad\\'s main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement . \\non the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe\\'s flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism . \\nin the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another . \\nthe final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad\\'s novel . \\nits absence in the film is unforgivable . \\nthe film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers . \\nalma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst\\'s underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with . \\nthe struggle against heyst\\'s ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma\\'s love for him . \\njacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible . \\nunfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script . \\nthe couple\\'s relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach . \\nall we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone . \\nthis is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions . \\nthe sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe\\'s american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) . \\nthe other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad\\'s meticulous characterization . \\nwhile schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma . \\nsam neil\\'s caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as \" an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror \" . \\npoor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder . \\nsewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones\\' back . \\nat the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans . \\ndespite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer , very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended . \\nsourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be . \\nthe delicately inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production . \\nat the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma\\'s victory was in teaching heyst how to love . \\na hollow victory indeed . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing ,

unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you\\'s and the drive me crazy\\'s released by the dozens these last couple of years . \\nwhat i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i\\'m sitting in the theater . \\nam i enjoying myself ? \\nis this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? \\nthis is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won\\'t remember next week . \\nso last week i opened up the new york times - and , no

from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive . \\ni had made up my mind ; i\\'ll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years . \\nbut , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn\\'t get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls . \\nwhoops . \\nboys and girls is about a \" nerdy , smart \" boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a \" popular , flirt \" girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) . \\nbriefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends . \\nbut in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other . \\nwith advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship . \\nthe film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found . \\ni could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons . \\nthe dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to . \\nit is almost offensive . \\nan example of an insightful conversation : \\n \" you\\'re dumb . \\ndumb , dumb , dumb , dumb . \" \\n \" no . \" \\n ( followed by a mandy moore-esque tune background ) \\n ( well it\\'s not as bad as wing commander i guess ) \\nthe supporting cast is also painfully useless . \\ndetmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring , pointless subplots . \\nand although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex , prinze jr\\'s ryan dominates the screen while forlani\\'s jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with . \\nwe never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character . \\nteenager or not : you\\'ll hate this movie , i guarantee it . \\nmaybe i should rent she\\'s all that again . \\nis it really as good as i think it is ? \\n',\n"," b'by starring in amy heckerling\\'s \" clueless \" two summers ago , alicia silverstone proved she wasn\\'t just another pretty , pouty ingenue , showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blew all previous jobs -- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of \" the crush \" -- out of the water . \\nher only work since that 1995 gem has been in june\\'s \" batman & robin , \" where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl . \\nnow , she\\'s the star and producer of \" excess baggage , \" a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill-composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level . \\nsilverstone\\'s emily t . hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally . \\nin an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw . \\nbut before the police can \" rescue \" her , professional auto thief vincent roche ( benicio del toro ) jimmies the locks , hot-wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily , who\\'s still trapped in the back . \\nwhen vincent discovers emily , the two don\\'t exactly hit it off -- she annoys him , he annoys her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr . ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there . \\nalong the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony-studded situation . \\nit doesn\\'t help matters that emily and vincent are being trailed by cops , crooks and even her shady uncle ray ( christopher walken ) , who\\'s wise to his niece\\'s ploys for attention and has mafia connections . \\nfor at least a half-hour , \" excess baggage \" bounces along fast and efficiently . \\nduring this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role-reversal twist -- she\\'s an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he\\'s quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor . \\nbut once it\\'s past its set-up , the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once . \\na road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and \" excess baggage \" likely covers its territory . \\nof course a romance develops between the two leads , but it all seems forced , and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome . \\n \" do you like my tummy ? \" \\nemily coos to vincent at one point in the film . \\nhuh ? \\ndid i miss something ? \\nthe hard-edged , foul-mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting goo-goo eyes . \\nthen again , \" excess baggage \" becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise . \\na supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles , but the movie isn\\'t game enough to use them all and therefore seems overcrowded . \\nmotivations keep shifting , resulting in an often confusing narrative . \\nscant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions . \\n \" excess baggage \" has too many characters , too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand . \\ni loved silverstone\\'s turn in \" clueless \" as an aloof , pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen\\'s \" emma . \" \\nlooking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there , it\\'s simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for \" excess baggage . \" \\nsadly , however , \" excess baggage \" is no \" clueless . \" \\nbut , on the other hand , it is clueless . \\n',\n"," b'funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways . \\nthe ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . \\nwhat it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . \\n \" get new jobs ! \" \\nwas one line , if i remember correctly . \\nat the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . \\nhe is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . \\npatterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . \\nthe movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy . \\nthey are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . \\ngive me a break . \\nthe movie hasn\\'t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it\\'s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . \\neven the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . \\nget this : remington\\'s big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . \\nhe does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . \\nby the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . \\nthe acting is forgettable . \\ndouglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it\\'s nothing he hasn\\'t done before . \\nkilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . \\nthe camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . \\nwhat did i expect from this movie ? \\ni dunno . \\nsome real excitement , i suppose . \\na sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . \\nno such luck . \\ni dug out my tattered copy of hemingway\\'s \" the short happy life of francis macomber \" and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind . \\n',\n"," b'i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . \\nusing their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . \\nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . \\nnow , before i continue to ferociously attack what\\'s wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . \\ncatherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . \\nif you\\'ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don\\'t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . \\nthe problem we come to is that we\\'ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn\\'t break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . \\nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived . \\ni\\'m going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . \\nnow while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn\\'t for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . \\njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" . \\nwith an eighty million dollar budget , you\\'d think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . \\nwell , you\\'d be wrong . \\nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . \\nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . \\nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what\\'s going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . \\nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . \\none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . \\nnothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn\\'t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? \\ni\\'ll tell you why : because it\\'s a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones\\' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . \\nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . \\none last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he\\'ll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . \\ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself \" it\\'ll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? \" \\nwe know jon , it\\'s called editing . \\n',\n"," b'august and september are a wasteland when it comes to children\\'s films , and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the

max . \\nthings don\\'t get any better for max when he arrives at school . \\nhe has to contend with , among other things , a red-hot science teacher ( amber valletta , family man ) , a pair of

change-of-pace from fall\\'s onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait , and \" troopers \" does the job admirably despite its flaws . \\nfor its first hour , \" starship troopers \" plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of \" saved by the bell \" and \" g . i . \\njane . \" \\nin the distant years ahead , high school grad johnny rico ( casper van dien ) signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot , so the couple is broken up . \\nbut there\\'s temptation awaiting both of them -- johnny\\'s is in the form of an old friend ( dina meyer ) also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush , while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor ( patrick muldoon ) . \\npersonal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final 65 minutes , when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america , killing johnny\\'s parents and destroying his home . \\nour weakening , lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry , and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens\\' home planet , where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good . \\nbut the enemy is far smarter , more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for , and after an initial walloping , they must re-examine their strategy . \\nthe exposition -- played like a futuristic soap opera -- is silly , but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans . \\nonce we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous ( but never boring ) training sessions , \" starship troopers \" really kicks into high gear . \\nits last half is all gruesomely violent action -- a fury of severed limbs , decapitations , disembowelments , brain removal , explosions and other jolt-inducers that are really going to please the 13- and 14-year-old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r-rated show . \\nthe creature design and special effects are amazing as expected , and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic , imaginative high point . \\nit\\'s nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren\\'t too derivative of the titular menace from \" alien . \" \\nthese monsters are appropriately terrifying sights , especially the arachnids , a spider-scorpion-crab combo that\\'s all sharp talons and even sharper legs . \\nthey attack in packs of hundreds , and it\\'s a funny , scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl , jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined , gooey mess . \\nit matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ( ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot ) ; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous , bloody and immensely satisfying . \\nthe occasional dramatic moments -- one cast member\\'s death , the final resolution to johnny\\'s love triangle -- are botched , a testament to how \" starship troopers \" fails to create any strong , outstanding characters . \\nthese bland ken-and-barbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arm\\'s length , but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la \" star wars , \" where even the slightest aliens had definite personality . \\nthe acting is decent ( but never spectacular ) ; most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory -- smallish roles on \" beverly hills 90210 \" and/or \" melrose place \" -- and it occasionally shows . \\nvan dien , for example , is limited but perfectly likeable . \\nin smaller parts are the afore-mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny\\'s best friend and jake busey ( gary\\'s son ) as johnny\\'s sidekick ; the latter excels at playing creeps ( see \" the frighteners \" or \" contact \" ) but seems off-kilter as a second banana . \\n \" starship troopers \" is based on the novel by robert heinlein , a sci-fi writer who hasn\\'t exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994\\'s howler \" the puppet masters . \" \\nbut the overall familiarity to the \" alien \" trilogy -- and the promise of great gobs of gore -- could act as a crowd-drawer . \\nits own possible influence , however , might well work against it when the franchise continuation \" alien : resurrection \" opens in a few weeks . \\nwe will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall . \\n',\n"," b'the tagline for this film is : \" some houses are just born bad \" . \\nso i didn\\'t expect too much from this . \\nbut i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . \\ni thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . \\ni thought , mabe it will be fun ? \\nand in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . \\nbut by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . \\nthese great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . \\nhere is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . \\namong them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . \\nactually , the doctor is researching the \" primordial fear reaction \" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch ! \\nwhat happens . \\nbut he gets unexpected help from the house itself . \\nit rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . \\nportals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs . \\na fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . \\nfilmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . \\nbut the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . \\nthe second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . \\nis that exciting or what ? \\nthe worst thing about it is that it didn\\'t have to be bad . \\nit\\'s based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , \\'\\' by shirley jackson . \\na 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . \\nit played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . \\n \" the blair witch project \" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . \\nand with a $70 mill . \\nbudget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . \\nde ! \\nbont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . \\nhe is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . \\nbut why give him a more serious material ? \\nin the end \" haunting \" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont\\'s career as a director . \\nyet it wouldn\\'t be fair to say that everything is bad . \\nthe effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . \\nbut this is where the good things end . \\nthe music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life . \\nit\\'s nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn\\'t engage . \\nat first you do not know what\\'s going on . \\nis this part of the experiment ? \\nare these hallucinations ? \\nprojections of the subconscience ? \\nparanoia ? \\nbut in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . \\nthe house is actually possessed . \\nit is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . \\nfor ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that\\'s what i got ? \\ni believe hichock once said that \" it\\'s ! \\nbetter to wait for a climax , than to see one \" . \\nthis may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid . \\nthey are impossible to take seriously . \\nany paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick\\'s \" the shining \" , are absolutely baseless . \\n \" shining \" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality . \\n \" haunting \" has only special effects and art direction to boast of . \\nand those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . \\ncasting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse . \\nbut i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : \" some films are just born stupid \" . \\n',\n"," b'tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently . \\nthe dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months . \\n \" kundun \" ( \" presence \" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader . \\na group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention . \\nthe young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as \" mine \" . \\nhe and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country . \\nhe is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 . \\nthe peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results . \\neventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india . \\ncomparisons to \" seven years in tibet \" are inevitable . \\nboth films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner\\'s point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt . \\n \" kundun \" features only native actors and is more of an insider\\'s story . \\nin some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made \" seven years \" such an audience-pleaser . \\nthe actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) . \\nthe only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character . \\non an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts . \\nsome events are depicted differently and pitt\\'s austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama\\'s life isn\\'t even mentioned here . \\nglossed over in \" seven years \" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses \" we were just about to change things \" after the chinese attack . \\nthe film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins . \\nhis lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail . \\nespecially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain . \\nthe visual treats more than make up for the movie\\'s faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience . \\nwalking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience . \\nmartin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( \" goodfellas \" , \" taxi driver \" , \" casino \" ) has shifted gears . \\nsomething of a thematic follow-up to his \" the last temptation of christ \" , this is his slowest film yet . \\noddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen . \\nhis decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable . \\nthe stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations . \\nphilip glass\\'s score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting . \\ni talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again . \\nhearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie . \\nas grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie . \\nthe film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings . \\nwith the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight . \\none of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can\\'t resist being a kid sometimes . \\nan encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren\\'t many of these . \\neven with its problems , the \" kundun \" experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss . \\nmany people who saw \" seven years in tibet \" will have a \" been there , done that \" attitude . \\nit\\'s likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping . \\n',\n"," b' \" mission to mars \" is one of those annoying movies where , in the middle of the movie , you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie : all five minutes of it . \\n \" mission \" * does * give you payoff ; but when it does come , it\\'s too little , too late . \\n \" mission \" has some good ideas , but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery , dime-a-dozen dialogue , and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard-cutout roles . \\ni\\'m sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with , so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm . \\nglances don\\'t communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end . \\nthe film spends an hour on this kind of stuff , building to its climax . \\na lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships , marriage , friendship , unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap . \\nthere are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film , and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know ( trying is the key word here ) . \\nthe sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching , but as mentioned by then we\\'re so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over . \\ngreat design , good intentions , but no cigar . \\nif you\\'re not a die hard sci-fi , fx or jerry o\\'connell fan ( his character is the only one who has some semblance of character ) , don\\'t waste your eight bucks on this . \\nand what the hell , tim robbins died halfway through the movie , in a stupid way too . \\nthat\\'s just unforgiveable . \\n',\n"," b'libby parsons ( ashley judd ) has the perfect little life -- a rich husband , a cute son , and a house on the ocean -- but when her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her sailing , she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered with blood . \\njust as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife lying there , the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husband sent . \\nshe\\'s convicted of his murder , of course , and leaves her son matty ( benjamin weir ) with her best friend ( annabeth gish ) . \\ntime passes , and the friend disappears with matty . \\nduring their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell \" daddy ! \" \\nand realizes that her husband is still alive . \\nlibby serves six years , growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick ( based on the theory that because of the \" double jeopardy \" amendment she can off him with impunity ) . \\nwhen she gets parole , she\\'s sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) , a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident . \\nafter a little breaking and entering and some destruction of property , libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty . \\ntravis pursues , naturally . \\n \" double jeopardy \" is a watered-down version of \" the fugitive , \" with jones sleep-walking through his well-worn pursuer persona . \\nalthough libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a train , she manages to get into a few nail-biters -- chased down the beach by a jeep , chained to a car that plunges into the ocean , sealed in a coffin -- that add some much needed thrills to an anemic , slow-moving script . \\ncharacter development is thin . \\ntravis\\' intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times but has no effect on the story . \\n ( i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the double-jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick . \\nit\\'s a long way to go for one line ) . \\nthere\\'s considerable sexual tension between travis and libby ( hey , there\\'s something \" the fugitive \" didn\\'t have ! ) , but it never goes anywhere . \\nlibby is a tv-movie everywoman , but judd\\'s intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics . \\nthis is judd\\'s most prominent role to date , and she proves that she can light up the screen . \\nlet\\'s hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around . \\nthe quality of director bruce beresford\\'s movies seems to depend on luck . \\nwhen he has a good script and a strong cast , he turns out oscar-caliber work like \" \\'breaker\\' morant , \" \" driving miss daisy , \" and \" tender mercies . \" \\nwhen he doesn\\'t . \\n . \\n . \\nwe get \" double jeopardy . \" \\nscreenwriters david weisberg and douglas cook previously collaborated on \" the rock , \" a script which probably benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites . \\nbottom line : ashley judd tries hard but can\\'t save this predictable bore . \\n',\n"," b'if you\\'re debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ , ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ? \\nthe only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph\\'s chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight . \\neveryone else--and i\\'m hoping that\\'s most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess . \\nactually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover\\'s exit 11 motor village in midland city . \\nnot only is he a huge success as a businessman , he\\'s also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials . \\nwith a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he\\'s not . \\nhis wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name \" bunny . \" \\nnot only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne\\'s ass over a building development project . \\nit\\'s enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is , if he doesn\\'t succeed in blowing his brains out first . \\nmeanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival\\'s organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact , he\\'s a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines . \\nhis trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey , one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne , who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life\\'s answers . \\nthe above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews , but , ironically , i have barely scratched the surface . \\ni haven\\'t yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps ) , an ex-con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly-named dwayne . \\nthen there\\'s the matter of francine ( glenne headly ) , dwayne\\'s devoted secretary . \\nnot to mention dwayne\\'s employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte ) , the one with the secret penchant for cross-dressing . \\nand so on . \\nthe film is essentially dwayne\\'s story , but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is . \\nrudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later ) , but it\\'s blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material . \\nthe surreal visual style , complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne\\'s ears , is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness , but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad . \\nthe actors are called on to act accordingly , resulting in some of the worst , most overdone work all of them have ever turned in . \\nwillis fares best of all--but that\\'s because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience . \\nwith such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time , it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious , and rudolph tries to make a statement . \\nunlike _american_beauty_ ( a film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways , to its great detriment ) , there isn\\'t any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift . \\nas such , the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned ; and the film attempts , to no avail , to reach a profundity that it doesn\\'t deserve . \\nvonnegut\\'s original novel is considered a classic , but it had been called unfilmable--the same that was said of hunter s . thompson\\'s _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_ , which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam . \\nwith the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_ , will hollywood ever learn that books labeled \" unfilmable \" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable ? \\nlikely not . \\n',\n"," b\"this feature is like a double header , two sets of clich ? s for the price of one . \\nnot only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts , but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure . \\nan original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance . \\nthe screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins , based on a story by falls , merely lobs its plotline at the audience . \\nthis is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching . \\nsummer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr . ) , a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league , supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country . \\nryan is a blue-collar kind of guy . \\nhe works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod's rich and famous . \\nhe also , as we are informed early , his own worst enemy . \\nhe has the potential and the talent , but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment . \\nso , ryan tries to remained focused on baseball . \\nthen he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel ) , daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures . \\ntenley , a name only a hack screenwriter could invent , is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan . \\nif you can't figure out where all this nonsense leads , then you need a remedial course in film viewing . \\nas always prinze is pretty to look at , but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love , heartbreak , frustration , self-loathing or determination . \\nbiel cries a lot , while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father . \\nthe only beacon is matthew lillard's fun-loving billy brubaker , the team's catcher . \\nsummer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies , such as bull durham and the natural . \\nno curve balls here , no sliders . \\nevery pitch is predictable . \\na blind umpire could call this movie . \\nsummer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking . \\nit has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn . \\n\",\n"," b'the characters in jonathan lynn\\'s \" the whole nine yards , \" yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies ( 1999\\'s \" analyze this \" and \" mickey blue eyes , \" 2000\\'s \" gun shy \" ) , are rarely ever written as real people , but merely as one-dimensional caricatures . \\nwhen an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed , it is not to service the character development , or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations , but to accommodate the convoluted plot . \\nin a lightweight comedy , you might say , it is not required to have perfectly realized figures , just as long as they get the job done . \\nunfortunately , for a comedy to work , it has to at least succeed at being funny , and if there was a laugh-o-meter available , i\\'d guess that it briefly ascended around 2 . 5% of the time for me . \\nsuffice to say , the comedy in \" the whole nine yards \" works about as well as the broken-down lawnmower in my backyard , and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes , it is by sheer luck . \\nnicholas \" oz \" oseransky ( matthew perry ) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec . \\ntrapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie ( rosanna arquette , delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french-canadian accent ) , one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next-door . \\nwalking over to greet him , he is horrified to discover it is jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski ( bruce willis ) , a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison . \\nonce getting to know him and becoming his friend , oz is more comfortable with his identity , but for sophie , it means a possible hitman to do away with oz . \\nin her scheme , sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss ( kevin pollak ) about jimmy\\'s whereabouts , but in the process , he falls in love with jimmy\\'s wife , cynthia ( natasha henstridge ) , who is being held hostage . \\nupon return to quebec , and with one contrivance after the next , oz\\'s dental assistant , jill ( amanda peet ) , is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside \" the tulip , \" and forces him to set up a meeting , since jill\\'s dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself . \\nhave you got all that ? \\nbecause there is more . \\nmuch , much more . \\nand this is a movie that , without credits , is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour . \\n \" the whole nine yards \" is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures . \\nhow the cast , most of which are respectable actors , got caught up in such a cliched , deficient film remains a mystery , unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn\\'s 1985 comedy classic , \" clue : the movie . \" \\ngoing into the theater , preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable , but by the twenty-minute mark , when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time , it was clear this production was in serious trouble . \\nsince the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot , and the screenplay , inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner , collapses with every failing \" comedy \" bit , the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and , frequently , entertainment value . \\n \" the whole nine yards \" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill\\'s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark . \\na few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all . \\non the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis . \\nperry , innocuously enjoyable on tv\\'s \" friends , \" plays the same exact sitcom-style character in all of his movies ( from 1997\\'s \" fools rush in \" to 1999\\'s \" three to tango \" ) , and it has become a crushing bore . \\nmeanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy \" the tulip \" tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background . \\ntheir three female counterparts fare noticeably better . \\nbest of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative \" species \" movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia . \\nhenstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent . \\namanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy . \\nit is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts . \\nfinally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time . \\nalso popping up is michael clarke duncan , fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in \" the green mile , \" as jimmy\\'s largely built friend and fellow killer , frankie figs . \\nwhen \" the whole nine yards \" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit . \\na great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ? \\nwithout a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments , \" the whole nine yards \" rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast , and half of the actors are not charming at all . \\nnow , what does that tell you ? \\n',\n","

to menace society , it may take the scientists\\' combined efforts to stop them before they terminate the evolution of another lifeform : humanity . \\nreview : \" evolution \" certainly has the ingredients for a decent comedy . \\nit\\'s directed by reitman , clearly trying to parlay his \" ghostbusters \" success into a twenty-first-century counterpart . \\nit stars duchovny , and although one might question his judgment in lampooning his \" x-files \" character so soon after leaving the tv series , it should certainly provide him with plenty of ammunition . \\nand then there\\'s moore , who may not have much prior experience in comedy , but who has certainly proven her ability as an actress . \\na shame , then , that it all deteriorates into such a hopelessly unfunny morass . \\n \" evolution \" is a movie more concerned with its special effects ( which are quite good ) than anything resembling a consistently funny script . \\nit has its moments ( a scene in which jones\\' body is invaded by an alien is particularly entertaining ) , but there are embarrassingly long stretches that are utterly devoid of humour . \\nmoore is totally wasted , her clumsy shtick getting very old , very fast . \\nduchovny has stunningly little in the way of material to work with . \\nand the story is so formulaic , it could have been written by monkeys . \\npart of what made \"

we\\'ve had absolute power , air force one , shadow conspiracy and murder at 1600 . \\nthis one is about as lame duck as old gerald ford , trying to bring us a complex plot of cover-up and intrigue but copping out over and over again with rehashes of action flick standbys . \\nhere\\'s what happens this time . \\nit\\'s night at the white house . \\na secretary is having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute butt . \\nthe next day she\\'s dead and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in . \\nhow do we know he\\'s a hotshot ? \\nwe\\'ve seen the traditional action flick opener -- the clever hostage negotiation scene . \\nit\\'s not so clever this time , consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex-government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street . \\nsnipes is off to the white house , where he finds the secret service head ( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali ) won\\'t cooperate with him at all . \\nin fact , if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda , snipes wouldn\\'t have been allowed in the white house at all . \\nalda helps snipes out further , assigning a sexy secret service agent ( diane lane ) to act as his liaison . . . \\na very dangerous liaison . \\nwell , not really , i just wanted to say that . \\nalmost immediately , a suspect is found , an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos . \\nsnipes doesn\\'t buy it , and launches into an independent investigation of his own , one that reveals planted evidence and romantic involvement by the president\\'s son . \\nsnipes\\' partner , an always- wisecracking dennis miller , calls him up every once in awhile with more news and lane , who at first doesn\\'t believe snipes , eventually and predictably comes around , and risks her ass to break into social security storage and break out some classified information . \\nfor the first hour or so , murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting . \\nsure , we have to sit through the lame opening sequence and plenty more lame scenes after that , but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise that is never quite delivered upon . \\nsnipes and lane don\\'t make for a bad action team , but with nothing to work with , they\\'re just cogs in the bad movie machine . \\ndennis miller might as well not even be in the movie ; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they did in bordello of blood , and that\\'s saying a lot . \\nwhen you get to the last half-hour , the movie has descended metaphorically and literally into a wet sewer , busting out the old break-into-the-building underground climax . \\nand when they finally reveal who killed the woman and why , you\\'ll wish you never sat through this movie at all . \\nthe \" 1600 \" in the movie\\'s title doesn\\'t represent an address , it represents the number of satisfied customers

space isn\\'t exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series \" beavis and butt-head \" was pure gold for its network ) . \\nbut unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground . \\nthe iffiness in judge\\'s plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal . \\nin fact , based on the popularity of scott adams\\' cartoon \" dilbert , \" which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood . \\nunfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of \" saturday night live \" rather than a full-length feature . \\nthe most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie\\'s top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated . \\nother evidence of office space\\'s failure to work are its lack of good jokes . \\nthe comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud . \\nthe material in the movie is on-key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here . \\nhowever , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse . \\nthe plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech . \\nafter the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of \" downsizing \" the company\\'s payroll . \\nwhen peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) \\'s stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall . \\nthe circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but . \\na sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it\\'s definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent . \\n',\n"," b' \" the 44 caliber killer has struck again .

abilities . \\nlee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg . \\nbut here , he gets himself into a bind . \\nhis latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work . \\nthe summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city . \\nit was the hottest summer on record . \\nto boot , new york\\'s first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population . \\nso it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city . \\nthe movie\\'s focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club-hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters . \\nwe follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings . \\nvinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her . \\nritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more \" eccentric , \" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend . \\ntensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam\\'s first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again . \\na local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects . \\nat the top of the list is ritchie . \\nvinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend . \\nas we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded \" so what ? \" \\nquestion springs to mind . \\nfrom the way this movie is made , i\\'d have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find . \\nlee touches on so much -- the media , the 70\\'s punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters\\' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn\\'t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement . \\nall is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable . \\ntoo bad summer of sam doesn\\'t get any help here . \\nfrankly , it\\'s a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn\\'t entertain beyond its first half hour . \\nthere is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague . \\nleguizamo\\'s turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny . \\nthe script makes it clear that we\\'re supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy . \\nyou\\'d never guess from his performance . \\nadrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better . \\nsorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i\\'m tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart . \\nbrody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for . \\nsummer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it\\'s pretty well directed , in a purely technical way . \\nbut it\\'s also empty , pretentious and boring . \\nlike last year\\'s the thin red line , it\\'s a movie by a director who doesn\\'t know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway . \\n ? 1999

certain death by a lion . \\nreluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate . \\ncomments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies . \\nshe proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner . \\nthe clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title . \\nnot even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese . \\nit\\'s so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it\\'s oddly fascinating . \\nthe ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel . \\nto this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following . \\ni remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother . \\ni have never read this book , but i sure hope it\\'s 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation . \\nif not , then i\\'m at a complete loss to explain its popularity . \\nthe clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene . \\na young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . , \\ntramps about in the woods . \\nwith her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience\\'s expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered . \\nwhat follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla\\'s mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er , \\nleggings ) . \\ntearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well , \\nas the earthquake slowly recedes . \\na hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven . \\ni won\\'t detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point . \\nthis movie is really stupid . \\nit never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief . \\nalso , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four . \\na blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs . \\nshe\\'s of the \" new people \" ; they\\'re of the \" old people \" with \" the memories . \" \\nyep . \\nwe get it . \\nwe get it . \\nthe clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me . \\nthe movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing . \\nas stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time . \\nthe rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt . \\nthe face-painting that\\'s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind . \\nthis movie also suffers from its new age trappings . \\nmaybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music . \\nadd to this the film\\'s faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you\\'d expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it\\'s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i\\'ve seen in quite a while . \\nit contains several scenes of sex sans nudity . \\nthe violence mostly consists of hunting scenes . \\nthe funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear . \\nthe bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about . \\nalthough this may sound gratuitous , i\\'m sure , it\\'s so cheesy that it probably won\\'t bother most people . \\nthe clan of the cave bear is a bad movie . \\nhowever , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality . \\ntypically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind . \\nthe clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it\\'s so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) . \\ni have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i\\'m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie . \\ni shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . . \\n',\n"," b'director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) . \\nfilm is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something . \\nbut most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story . \\nso whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review . \\nand when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment . \\nfincher\\'s the game is no exception to this . \\nthe game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time . \\nfincher hasn\\'t made a film since \" seven , \" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever . \\nso it is about time he made another film . \\nand what a ride it is . \\nthe game isn\\'t quite as powerful as \" seven , \" but in some ways it is better . \\noverall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty . \\nit walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end . \\nthe outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight . \\nunfortunately , unlike \" the usual suspects , \" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false . \\nhowever , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent . \\nthe game is told completely from its main character\\'s point of view . \\nnicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman . \\nhe lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion . \\nfor his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services . \\n \" it will make your life fun again , \" his brother promises . \\nas skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates . \\nseeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company . \\njim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games . \\n \" each game is suited to each person\\'s emotional and psychological needs , \" explains feingold . \\none day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests . \\neven more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company . \\nwhat he doesn\\'t realize is that the game has already begun . \\nthe phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas\\' way . \\nhow he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive . \\nthe detail involved in fincher\\'s shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them . \\nwith \" seven , \" fincher had almost every single shot mean something . \\nhe also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to . \\ncompared to \" seven , \" though , the game is light and comical . \\nbecause of this film\\'s sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously . \\nso don\\'t try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn\\'t want you to . \\nwhat does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear . \\nif taken as it is , the game\\'s ending makes complete sense . \\nbut if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility . \\nperhaps that is the reason i docked the film . \\nwhile trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen . \\nwe don\\'t really care if douglas\\' character lives or not because it isn\\'t believable . \\nthe ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller . \\nmichael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas . \\ndouglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance . \\nhis character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody . \\ncan he believe the waitress he bumped into ? \\nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? \\ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his \" falling down \" persona ) . \\nthe supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical . \\nsean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas\\' brother . \\ndeborah kara unger ( from \" crash \" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good . \\nin fact , she almost steals the film from douglas . \\njames rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas\\' predicament . \\nanother good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from \" shine \" ) as the book editor . \\nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life . \\nthe game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs . \\nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing . \\njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments . \\nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects\\' did . \\nhowever , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . \\nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year\\'s best films . \\n',\n","

since the actors and director are in on the joke . \\nas far as set-up is concerned , the movie is nothing we haven\\'t seen before , but be patient -- \" palmetto \" spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don\\'t see coming . \\nit\\'s not a classic by any means , but it sure is quite an engaging surprise . \\nharry barber ( woody harrelson ) is fresh out of prison , where he\\'s served a couple of years for a crime he didn\\'t commit . \\neven though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials , harry\\'s first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) . \\nwhile searching for work , he catches the eye of rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire . \\nrhea proposes a scheme that\\'ll get harry $50 , 000 easy -- to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny ) . \\n \" you do like risks , don\\'t you , mr . barber ? \" \\nrhea alluringly coos . \\nboys , form a line behind me . \\npart of \" palmetto \" \\'s success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue , who demonstrates here that her oscar-nominated turn in \" leaving las vegas \" might merely be foreshadowing great things to come . \\nshue\\'s a seductive , campy delight , and pulls off a barbara stanwyck-gloria swanson combo with admirable relish . \\nthe other actors form a solid ensemble around her , including sevigny ( \" kids \" ) , tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease , as well as the ever-likeable gershon , cast a far cry from her extreme roles in \" bound \" and \" showgirls . \" \\nharrelson is still doing fine follow-up work to \" the people vs . larry flynt . \" \\n \" palmetto \" does have its share of grievances . \\nharrelson\\'s narration is needless , i suppose , and gershon\\'s nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is . \\none of the plot\\'s unexpected angles -- that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which he\\'s involved -- could have been played a little better . \\nthere are moments when you question the tone , but it\\'s never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it\\'s been receiving from most other critics . \\nif \" palmetto \" didn\\'t want to be laughed at , would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a live-action \" who framed roger rabbit \" ? \\nalthough a few elements can be questioned , the movie works well on its own terms . \\nthanks to a juicy cast -- especially shue -- and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff ( you remember him from last summer\\'s suddenly re-popular \" the tin drum , \" right ? ) , \\neverything runs smoothly . \\nand for fans of revelation-heavy endings , this film\\'s got a few shocks in store that i won\\'t even dream of revealing . \\n \" palmetto \" is a generous amount of fun to watch , and that\\'s all you need to know . \\n',\n"," b'available for rental - october 12 , 1999 \\n10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew . \\nthat said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare\\'s work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey\\'s crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca\\'s sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short . \\nwith movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance . \\nyet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage . \\nthe first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca\\'s last name : stratford . \\ntheir family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman\\'s larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly . \\nin what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family \" no dating \" policy is amended to \" bianca can date . . . when \\n[katarina] does . \" \\nwith prom just ahead , bianca\\'s fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew . \\ndon\\'t think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister \" . . . is a particularly hideous breed of loser . \" \\ngetting katarina to date is complex and oftentimes confusing . \\nwhen cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father\\'s new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice . \\nthe scheme they dream up is to fully exploit \" someone with money . \" \\nin this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca . \\ncameron\\'s friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out . \\nthe solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \\nthis verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison . \\nmoreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that \" hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . \" \\nthe laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet . \\nproviding a constant reminder of the fact that this isn\\'t exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy : a party polluted with liquor , a best friend\\'s betrayal , and prom . \\nit is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she\\'s all that , and can\\'t hardly wait . \\nyet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way . \\n',\n"," b'pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is \" sex \" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review . \\nbecause of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of \" sex \" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \\\\ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it\\'s most likely just another way of referring to \" sex \" . \\ni think we\\'d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review . \\nthough not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what . \\nbody shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you\\'d normally expect to see a violent attack . \\nit\\'s about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it . \\nthese are things we all do , sometimes . \\nthe characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts . \\ntheir lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed . \\nit\\'s as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek . \\nat its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition . \\nmichael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say . \\nhis characters don\\'t communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera . \\nthey voice simplistic platitudes like \" i like to come \" or \" sex without love equals violence \" . \\nhuh ? \\nand yes that is as complex as this movie\\'s observations get . \\nthe characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more . \\nthe plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events . \\nwe meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy . \\ni would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot . \\ni\\'m not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others . \\nwith the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin . \\ni vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( \" sex without love equals violence \" ) . \\nin between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning . \\nthe fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me . \\nthis film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining . \\nif body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don\\'t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side . \\nadditionally that one side isn\\'t even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness . \\nor realism . \\none sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters . \\nthey suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn\\'t it erotic , it isn\\'t real . \\nit doesn\\'t feel like an authentic sexual encounter . \\nevery f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner . \\nbody shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film . \\nit shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it . \\nthe resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . \\nthe main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . \\nthe film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . \\nthis is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can\\'t think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80\\'s next to wall street . \\nunfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . \\npaul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . \\nit was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision . \\nthe characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . \\nhe gave them heart . \\ncristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . \\nhe preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . \\nthis is not the way to get any message across . \\nwhy not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin\\' skins ? \\ncristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation . \\n',\n"," b'here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \\nokay , it isn\\'t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \\nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \\nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \\na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \\nbut , the thing is , it isn\\'t . \\nit\\'s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \\ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \\nbut the species series isn\\'t about the lack of these elements . \\nit\\'s about how much it can get into one film . \\nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \\nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \\nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film\\'s needs . \\nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \\naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \\npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \\nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \\nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \\nof course , he isn\\'t the first ever . \\nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \\nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \\nno life lives on it . \\nthat is , no visible life . \\npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \\nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \\nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \\njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \\nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can\\'t even remember . \\nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \\nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \\nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \\nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \\npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \\neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \\nhowever , this time around , most of her \" alien \" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \\nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \\nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \\nand it has . \\nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \\nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \\nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \\nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \\nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \\nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \\nand it does it quite well . \\nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \\nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \\nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \\nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \\nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \\nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\\'s head being blown off . \\nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \\nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \\nhowever , i tend to disagree . \\nwhat were the alien films about ? \\nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \\nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \\ni didn\\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \\nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \\nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \\nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \\nokay , so it isn\\'t that good . \\ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \\nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \\nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \\noh yeah , and she\\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \\nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \\nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \\njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \\nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \\nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \\nand , of course , justin lazard . \\nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \\nsure , he is wooden , but isn\\'t that what his character is like ? \\nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\\'s acting . \\nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \\nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \\nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \\nhell , i don\\'t even know if i will . \\nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \\ni probably won\\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \\ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \\nmedak has also mastered the wonderful \" jump ! \" \\nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . \\nstrong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . \\n',\n"," b\"synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system . \\nthe subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend , laura , and becomes addicted to virtual reality , which , due to a design flaw in his unit , recreates the dead paris . \\ncomments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h . robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to strange days , a far superior film . \\nboth movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ) . \\ninterestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively . \\nthis exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction . \\nit's not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality . \\nunfortunately , it's been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie . \\nvirtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) . \\nthe film's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the movie progresses . \\nmany important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly . \\nthe cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles . \\njeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though unenergetically , plays the lead character . \\ncarrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which doesn't lend credence to the film's premise . \\nmeschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but his performance isn't something to write home about either . \\nvirtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background . \\nin other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but it's rather boring to just sit and watch . \\nthe movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt . \\nthis turkey , ultimately , isn't awful , but it's not particularly interesting or unique either . \\ndon't be seduced into watching this movie unless you've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch . \\n\",\n"," b'the coen brothers are back again , this time with homer\\'s \" odyssey \" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in \" o brother , where art thou ? \" \\nright for the beginning of \" o brother \" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song . \\nthe camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field . \\nit is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio . \\na strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films . \\ntheir characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in \" raising arizona \" ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in \" miller\\'s crossing \" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in \" fargo . \" \\nin all cases , and in \" o brother , \" too , the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people . \\nulysses everett is a handsome , hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department . \\nbut , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1 . 2 million . \\ntheir odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer\\'s original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money . \\nthere is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens . \\nthe story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys\\' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow . \\nsome of the interludes are an epiphany , though . \\nthe trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar-playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) . \\nthey become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , \" i am a man of constant sorrow . \" \\nit is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year . \\ncontrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of \" o brother . \" \\nin particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched . \\nthe scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of \" the wizard of oz . \" \\nthey don\\'t say \" lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! \" \\nand there\\'s no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we\\'re seeing here . \\nthe highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels . \\ngeorge clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today . \\nhe has the charm of a 30\\'s movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity . \\nulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets . \\nhis vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero-wanderer . \\nwhile clooney is the name draw for \" o brother , \" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar . \\nthe heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism . \\ndelmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine . \\nthe taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst . \\nall together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones . \\nthe colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys\\' odyssey . \\ncharles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o\\'daniel , who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re-election . \\njohn goodman is wicked as the one-eyed bible salesman and con artist , big dan teague . \\nmichael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary , george \" babyface \" nelson . \\nstephen root is amusing as the blind dj , rep\\'ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways . \\nholly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses\\' estranged wife , penny ( and the real reason for this adventure , not secret treasure ) . \\ntechs are , as expected in a coen brothers venture , first class . \\ncinematographer roger deakins , who has worked on five previous coen films , captures the sultry atmosphere of the south . \\nthe photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres , respectively . \\nonce again , roderick jaynes - the alter ego of ethan and joel coen - is on board as editor . \\nthe high points outweigh the low through most of \" o brother , where art thou ? \" \\nwith particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music . \\ni give it a b . \\n',\n"," b\"at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film . \\nnow my view has completely changed . \\nit's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride . \\nthe story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention . \\nthey meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs ) . \\nof course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves . \\nthus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians . \\nthe movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it's worse . \\ni don't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it's just not funny . \\nall the jokes are basically collected observations from the series . \\none such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series . \\ncreative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when they are used to death . \\na person can only take so much . \\nwe do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it . \\nit's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful . \\nit's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful . \\nspeaking of acting , 2 fine talents were wasted as well . \\nsigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked . \\nit's pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage . \\nit just shows you how disgraceful the film really is . \\nalan rickman however was not so lucky . \\nafter his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess . \\nit's just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away . \\nwhen the film couldn't get any worse , thankfully some nice special effects pop up . \\nlike many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film's box office results . \\ntimes it works , but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk . \\nwhen will it stop ? \\ni am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash . \\nit may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story . \\nis that too much to ask ? \\nobviously it is . \\nwhen galaxy quest finally ends , it literally crash lands . \\naside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic , it's an embarrassment to the cast , and it's

\" ) , roger s . h . \\nschulman ( \" balto \" ) and joe stillman ( \" beavis and butthead do america \" ) ) to adapt william steig\\'s children\\'s book . \\nthe bad news ? \\nthey\\'ve genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under the influence of william goldman\\'s \" the princess bride . \" \\nthe good news ? \\nthere\\'s so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales and popular culture that this movie should keep you in stitches . \\nwe get our first inkling that we\\'re in for a real treat as one of farquaad\\'s men , intent on rounding up magical creatures offers \\'five schillings for the possessed boy ! \\' after observing dreamworks\\' rendition of disney\\'s animated pinocchio . \\nmeanwhile within the castle walls , a gingerbread man being tortured \\nby farquaad spits icing and yells \\'eat me ! \\' \\nbefore breaking down and solemnly asking \\'do you know the muffin man ? \\' \\nshrek , a green giant with bobbly antennae-like ears , is a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit in ( although who could put up with his habit of making candles from his own ear wax ? ) . \\ndonkey is a hyperactive , endearingly stunted creature who can talk and , therefore , believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek . \\ndonkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess-guarding dragon . \\nthe princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat after learning she\\'s not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she\\'s been expecting . \\nwhen fiona\\'s true colors are exposed ( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor ) , a spark develops between her and shrek . \\nthe script\\'s details are gleefully impish , constantly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad\\'s dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and \\'it\\'s a small world\\' parody of an information booth to the blue bird which meets a most un-disneyish fate after duetting with fiona \\'snow white\\' style . \\npopular culture is represented with film references to \" babe \" and \" charlies\\' angels \" via \" the matrix . \" \\nmyers chooses his \\'so i married an axe murderer\\' scottish brogue for shrek in order to give his voice some heft . \\nwhile this may prove distracting for anyone familiar with that film , overall it works more than not . \\neddie murphy steals the show as the fast-talking , motown-singing donkey , proving once again his talent as a vocal performer ( is it another wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon , a creature murphy portrayed in disney\\'s \\'mulan ? \\' ) . \\nlithgow\\'s a good choice for the supercilious , height-challenged villain lord farquaad . \\ndiaz is energetic but ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona . \\n ( a better choice would have been minnie driver , who\\'s proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as disney\\'s \" tarzan , \" \" princess mononoke \" and the \" south park \" movie . ) \\nthe computer animation looks terrific ( particularly donkey ) , although it won\\'t elicit the types of oohs and aahs of pixar\\'s work ( \" toy story , \" \" a bug\\'s life , \" \" toy story 2 \" ) . \\nin keeping with its hip style , pop music is used , which like myer\\'s voice may be initially jarring , but ultimately satisfies ( while surveying bridal candidates via a \\'dating game\\' parody broadcast by snow white\\'s evil queen\\'s mirror , farquaad is told \\'fiona likes pina coladas\\' - cue jimmy buffet ! ) . \\n \" shrek \" has good lessons for kids and humor targetted at every age group in the family . \\nwhile it may be derivative of the 1987\\'s \" the princess bride , \" \" shrek \" addresses a new generation with similar sensibilities and doesn\\'t suffer in the comparison . \\n',\n"," b'even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality . \\nlike everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies . \\nconsequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf\\'s tribe . \\nlet me start out by saying that krippendorf\\'s tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that\\'s about its only asset . \\nthe best word to describe this film is \" asinine . \" \\nthe target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty . \\nkrippendorf\\'s tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules . \\nthe first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist . \\nthe second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two . \\nfinally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work . \\nonce upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college . \\nhe and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a \" lost tribe \" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished . \\nshortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf\\'s wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own . \\nnow , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings . \\nwhen he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the \" shelmikedmu \" . \\nto provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb . \\nsoon , much to krippendorf\\'s surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon . \\nbut one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud . \\nthe only way krippendorf\\'s tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt . \\nunfortunately , it\\'s impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this . \\ndirector todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags . \\nmeanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i . e . , how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative . \\nthe acting in underwhelming . \\ndreyfuss has definitely not given his \" all \" to the role of james krippendorf . \\nalongside him , jenna elfman , the spunky co-star of tv\\'s dharma and greg , radiates perkiness and little else . \\nthis quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length movie . \\nno one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne ( woody allen\\'s daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels . \\ni know that a movie\\'s in trouble when it\\'s half the length of titanic , but seems much longer . \\nmost of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set . \\nif there\\'s any upside , it\\'s that i don\\'t see much box-office support developing for this lame , ill-marketed miscue . \\nkrippendorf\\'s tribe will quickly become extinct . \\n',\n"," b'when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , \" dangerous liaisons for kids ! \" \\nit was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears\\' 1988 masterpiece . \\nimagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits . \\nand i was impressed . \\nin fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie . \\nit\\'s kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs . \\ni suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they\\'re smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined . \\ncruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do . \\ni also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be . \\nphillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont . \\nwow . \\nisn\\'t that a memorable name ? \\ni could just say it over and over again . \\nsebastian valmont . \\nit kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . \\nsebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can\\'t have , no material object out of his reach . \\nhe has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . \\nand , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don\\'t really exist . \\nthe ones who do are irritating . \\nsebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . \\nsince these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . \\nkathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . \\nbut it\\'s too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the \" paradigm of chastity and beauty . \" \\nso , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . \\nbut -- dear god ! \\n-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . \\ndangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . \\ncruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . \\nkathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . \\nshe is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . \\ngellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive . \\nwitherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn\\'t the moral staple she\\'s supposed to be : sure , she won\\'t have sex until she\\'s in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . \\nbut i can\\'t forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . \\ni have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . \\nand there\\'s one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . \\ntrue , he is bad , but it doesn\\'t help that he has no character to work with . \\nkumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . \\nthe film fails in every other way , too . \\nfirst of all , nobody talks like this . \\neven the \" intellectuals \" i know don\\'t bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering . \\nfor a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there\\'s no way we can join it . \\ncruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene . \\nearlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . \\nso , if we hate them , then what\\'s the point of an extended sex scene ? \\ntitillation , of course . \\nit can\\'t even work under the pretense of \" meaningful love scene , \" because we hate the characters . \\nit\\'s interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons . \\nkumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears\\' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) . \\nbut kids don\\'t act like this . \\nnobody acts like this . \\nin his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements . \\nthe result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it\\'s really deep and profound . \\ni\\'ll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn\\'t change the fact that it\\'s awful . \\n',\n"," b'i\\'ve never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski . \\nthe part of jeff \" the dude \" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect . \\nthe dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians . \\nhe\\'s enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes . \\nafter much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug . \\nthe dude assumes that these \" collection agents \" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug . \\nthe millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped . \\nhe wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers . \\ndude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers . \\ncomedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny . \\nit is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films . \\nnot only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure . \\nall the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived . \\neach person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension . \\nthe characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh . \\nit\\'s not what they do that\\'s funny , it\\'s who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie . \\nworth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that\\'s jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who\\'s in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as \" vaginal ; \" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator . \\naside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue . \\npeople lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . . \\nthey sound natural . \\ntaken with fargo , the coen brothers\\' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers . \\nethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he\\'s also good at technical directing . \\nhe and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film . \\nperhaps \" beautiful \" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty . \\nbut the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film . \\nall around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy . \\noutstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success . \\n',\n"," b'it\\'s a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it . \\nsuch is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_ . \\nthough the blurb alludes to \" a jungle filled with political intrigue , uneasy alliances , and murderous enemies at every turn , \" the story of the movie is actually quite simple ( and prosaic ) : a middle-aged japanese businessman named endo ( played by john fujioka ) and his assistant , both of whom have samurai aspirations , travel to africa in search of his ancestor , who went to bring buddhism to africa . \\nhe hires the services of down-at-the-heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo ( the redoubtable lance henriksen ) and his girlfriend ( arabella holzbog ) , and travels to the camp of an arms-merchant-cum-safari-host- cum-islamic-missionary ( john saxon ) and his wife ( lisa eilbacher ) . \\nthey are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch-doctor aspirations to conceal a pre-arranged arms deal , which subsequently falls through . \\ncongo escapes , finds endo\\'s ancestor\\'s sword , and comes back , guns blazing , to free the rest of them , and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword . \\nthe end . \\n_the last samurai_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable . \\nit is merely _there_ . \\nthe murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated , subplots that are never explained , and many scenes that make very little sense at all . \\nthe film is shot through with all the tired old \" inscrutable japanese samurai \" and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie . \\nit is quite slow-paced , with only a bit of action near the end , and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic . \\nmost of the acting is fair , with the possible exception of congo\\'s girlfriend . \\nlance henriksen is his usual scene-chewing self , and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie . \\nthe only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery . \\ni paid $3 for this film , from the discount rack at best buy , and halfway suspect i overpaid for it . \\nif you are in the mood for samurai , read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie . \\nskip _the last samurai_ unless you are a die-hard henriksen fan . \\n',\n"," b'i have never been a \" star trek \" fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them . \\ni do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , \" star trek : insurrection , \" is no exception . \\ndropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series , \" first contact , \" \" insurrection , \" tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba\\'ku , as well as the fountain of youth . \\nat the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son\\'a , who want to push all of the ba\\'ku out so that their own race will not die out . \\nalso attacking the ba\\'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise . \\nafter returning to jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force . \\nso several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba\\'ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six-hundred-years-old , but looks to only be in her thirties . \\n \" star trek : insurrection , \" is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996\\'s \" first contact , \" which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different . \\nin , \" insurrection , \" however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement . \\nthe film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff . \\nmeanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly . \\nthis plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast . \\nare filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ? \\nanother element of , \" star trek , \" films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later . \\nalthough donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , \" first contact . \" \\nshe should have returned for this one , but i don\\'t blame her for not wanting to waste her time with this movie\\'s disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller . \\n \" star trek : insurrection , \" is perhaps the weakest film in the \" star trek , \" series , although i have not seen what is widely considered the worst , \" star trek v : the final frontier . \" \\n \" insurrection , \" is the type of \" safe \" sequel that will bewilder non-fans , since it is so low-tech compared to most of today\\'s blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not very good , either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts . \\non second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out . \\nthat way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness . \\n',\n"," b'synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy\\'s mother , a fledgling restauranteur . \\nunsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman\\'s favor , he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way . \\ncomments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video . \\ntheir proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they\\'re typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity ( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) . \\nstalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect : the psycho never actually has an affair ; on the contrary , he\\'s rejected rather quickly ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) . \\nother than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable . \\nstalked does not provide much suspense , though that is what it sets out to do . \\ninterspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk ( it\\'s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men ) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen . \\nafter these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears . \\nthe narrator states that \" this is the story of daryl gleason \" and tells the audience that he is the stalker . \\nof course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels . \\nif the movie was meant to be about daryl , then it should have been called stalker not stalked . \\nokay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ; no guesswork required . \\nstalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious . \\nthe opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together . \\ndaryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her . \\nultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate . \\nthese plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet . \\nfor some reason , this genre\\'s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked . \\nstalked is no exception ( it\\'s a cat this time -- found in the shower ) . \\nevents like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked , where only one survives ( guess who it invariably always is and you\\'ll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) . \\nstalked\\'s cast is uniformly adequate : not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either . \\njay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much . \\nhe overdoes it , in other words , but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands . \\nmaryam d\\'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the \" stalked \" of the title , even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner . \\nbrooke ( d\\'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed . \\ntoward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl . \\nto ensure he won\\'t use it as another excuse to see her , brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house . \\ndoes she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ? \\nof course not . \\nshe tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house . \\nwhen daryl returns , he enters the house , of course , so our heroine is in danger . \\nsomehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door , daryl is oblivious to her presence inside . \\nthe whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience\\'s suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character\\'s intelligence . \\nstalked receives two stars because , even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring , it is not so bad that it cannot be watched . \\nrated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar , it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are . \\nif you\\'re in the mood for a good suspense film , though , stake out something else . \\n',\n"," b'reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \\nthe guy can\\'t seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \\nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \\ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" \\nit\\'s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \\nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \\nauteur theory be damned ; it\\'s kruger\\'s \" style \" , not the director\\'s that winds up on screen . \\nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . \\nand his numerous twists can\\'t even claim to be originals ; arlington rd\\'s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol\\' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn\\'t know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar \\nbe damned ) . \\n \" how did you know that ? \" \\nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \\n . \\n . \\nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger\\'s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it\\'s no wonder why he works so frequently . \\nhe\\'s quickly becoming miramax\\'s mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \\nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \\ntheir company\\'s current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . \\nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \\nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \\naffleck is such a puppy dog that it\\'s impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone\\'s bitch . \\nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . \\nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who\\'s played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \\njames frain is nick , rudy\\'s cellmate , a manslaughterer who\\'s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \\nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she\\'s never seen one picture of him . \\nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley\\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \\nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \\nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i\\'ve described might as well be irrelevant . \\nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \\nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \\nthough it\\'s an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \\nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \\nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \\n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \\nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \\nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \\ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \\nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \\nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \\ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \\nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \\ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \\nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \\n',\n"," b' \" with all that education , you should know what happiness is . \" \\nstarring sylvia chang , teresa hu , hsu ming , li lieh , mao hsueh-wei ; directed by edward yang ; written by yang and wu nien-chen ; cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui-kung \\nevery country has , eventually , its new wave . \\nfrance had its nouvelle vague , brazil its cinema novo , china its fifth generation , and on and on . \\nsome waves just take longer than others , before they wash over us , cleansing us with the balm of discovery . \\ntaiwan\\'s new wave came in the 1980s , in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien , wan jen , and edward yang ; that day , on the beach--yang\\'s first feature--is central . \\nit created a new language for young taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering . \\nlater works refined the techniques that yang first explored here , giving taiwan a distinctive international presence . \\nthat day itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation\\'s attempt to find a voice . \\nit does not lack ambition . \\nit anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan , in the manner of antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men , loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling . \\njia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its compass--her husband , her brother , friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents . \\nno one is happy . \\njia-li married her husband , we-lei , at a young age . \\nat the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so jia-li\\'s marriage seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will , they loved each other . \\nbut it goes wrong . \\nthat day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise . \\nthe film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured . \\nit unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother\\'s old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college . \\nboth women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness . \\ntheir circumstances ( and those of jia-li\\'s brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate . \\nit is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn\\'t . \\nthe problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy . \\nfor a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins . \\nthe film\\'s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan . \\nseen now , it does not seem provocative . \\nindeed , it\\'s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull . \\nand what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . \\nnor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material . \\nthere are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple\\'s first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband\\'s mistress--but they are brief . \\ntoo often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted . \\nperhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating . \\nbut jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties . \\nat two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded . \\nconsider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach . \\nthe thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation . \\neven so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point . \\nneedless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout . \\nthe look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative . \\nit was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it\\'s his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world\\'s leading cinematographers . \\nin the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image . \\nyou would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle\\'s inexperience or yang\\'s humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible . \\nin scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak . \\n',\n"," b'at times , you\\'d think edtv would be an entertaining film . \\ni mean , who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day ? \\nbut this average joe , ed perkuny , ( matthew mcconaughay ) , is a sappy , lifeless creation that wanders around , trying to solve everyone\\'s problems and settle his own . \\nmcconaughay is awful , especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans . \\nfrankly , he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys . \\nhe overacts in every way : his overexaggerant body language , obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance , and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life , and drops to his knee and cries . \\nthe rest of the cast is very good ; especially martin landau ( as ed\\'s step-father ) , who plays a cute role as the close-to-death old guy that makes all the witty comments . \\njenna elfman is good , ( but a little overemotional ) ; her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films , i . e . \\ncan\\'t hardly wait , and krippendorf\\'s tribe . \\nwoody harrelson , as ed\\'s brother ray , does his usual egg-headed role , with his comic wit as well ( he wrote a book entitled , \" my brother pissed on me . \" ) \\nelizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut , and dennis hopper , in a quick cameo as ed\\'s biological father , is a nice choice ( ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show ) . \\nellen degeneres stood out as the executive who , after awhile , decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec , rob reiner\\'s opinion . \\ni hate to compare this film to the truman show , but the fact is , i was ashamed to see this movie . \\nit felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed . \\nedtv had no real wit or genius ; it was typical hollywood . \\nextracting the tv part of the movie , you have the simple plotline : man steals brother\\'s girlfriend , girlfriend leaves town , man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on , slut breaks up with him , real girlfriend comes back , and voila , you have a romance . \\ni got so restless during this movie , i almost walked out . \\nthe only reason it doesn\\'t drop below a \" c \" grade is because of the fine supporting performances . \\nad2am \" i almost lost my nose . . . and \\ni like it . \\ni like breathing through it . \" \\n-jack nicholson , chinatown \\n',\n"," b'there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened . \\nand , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why . \\nthis movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago . \\nfire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god\\'s country , somewhere in eastern kentucky . \\nit\\'s beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) . \\nit turns out that he\\'s filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit . \\nseagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa . \\nno . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa . \\nit\\'s the environmental protection agency . \\ni had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers ! \\ntaggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice . \\nwritten by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks . \\nbut the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in . \\nseagal\\'s idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket . \\nbut to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people\\'s porches for free . \\nthat\\'s another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches . \\nslow and plodding , this project is a total mess . \\nthe sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige . \\nhere , his bravado basically turns into bullyness . \\ntownsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued . \\nfight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever . \\nand his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes . \\nthe most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment . \\nbut the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal . \\nkristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away . \\nseagal gallantly replies : \" i\\'ll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . \" \\ni was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background . \\nthis is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal\\'s righteousness and narcissistic arrogance . \\nseagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) . \\nhowever , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this . \\nstill , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity . \\n',\n"," b'movies like six days , seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford , anne heche , and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cents . ? \\nthe script was written by michael browning , and he

using characterization to propel the events , it will be completely random , and yet totally predictable ! ? \\nimagine that . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong -- six days , seven nights is not a boring picture ; ford and heche both do a great job . ? \\nthe sparks fly between them , and so most of browning\\'s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actors\\' sheer force of talent . \\n ? almost every scene between them has energy that the performers bring to the screen , and i found myself laughing pretty hard . ? \\nschwimmer is also funny , and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get . ? \\nand reitman , who has made some good films , at least tries to make things exciting . ? \\neven though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb , i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequences . \\nit\\'s just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces . ? \\nthe picture feels like it\\'s been hacked to pieces -- i wouldn\\'t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely . ? \\nthe ones that are here are as bad as they come ( i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ships ) , and i\\'d just like to shake the producers by the shoulders and scream , \" why did you pick this awful script ! ? \" ? \\nthe film is outright stupid , but some of the elements are subtly horrifying . ? \\nfor instance , take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo , and then feels really guilty . ? \\nthis is a serious problem in real life , but six days , seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device : ? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford . ? \\nin a script that lacks even a

big-budget pictures don\\'t realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves . ? \\ngood actors should sign to good scripts , and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash ,

that one of it's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 . \\nmcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films . \\nfright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles . \\nthis is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was . \\nwilliam ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us . \\n ( at least in the movies anyway . ) \\nit has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b-movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie's next door neighbor . \\ncharlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family . \\napparently charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling . \\nso she decides to exact a little bit of revenge . \\nthis ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again . \\none of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood . \\nfright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort . \\nwhile they are stylish , the vamps in this film just don't have the personality of the undead in the first film . \\nwith the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes . \\none bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie's very skeptical girlfriend . \\nit's really a shame that her career hasn't been better since she made this film . \\nragsdale does a fair job in this film , but doesn't give nearly the performance that he did in the original . \\nroddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately isn't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie . \\ni guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way . \\nthe original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner , part 2 had more of the feel of a music video . \\nnever a good thing for a horror film . \\nanother minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare . \\nfor that matter , they were almost nonexistent . \\nif i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice . \\nthe first fright night , on the other hand , would be right up near the top of my list . \\nif i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes . \\neither way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation . \\n\",\n"," b'writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \\nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \\ni suppose i\\'m not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it\\'s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron\\'s early works . \\nin fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \\nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron\\'s wing for years and years , i\\'m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \\nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \\nthe film seems to not only borrow it\\'s plot from last year\\'s similarly-fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the \\'80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter\\'s twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \\n \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \\nthey get on . \\nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \\nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \\nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \\nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \\nand it\\'s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don\\'t give a damn . \\ni almost don\\'t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he\\'s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \\nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo \\'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \\nor peter o\\'toole in \" caligula . \" \\ngreat actor , horrific performance . \\nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland\\'s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . \\nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone\\'s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it\\'s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \\n \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it\\'s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \\nand if you don\\'t believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there\\'s even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don\\'t really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \\nbut all of this doesn\\'t matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \\nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i\\'ve ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn\\'t figure it out when i saw it ) . \\nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that\\'s basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \\nand my god , it\\'s a long damn sit . \\nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it\\'s a wonder that it even got made . \\nwe already know that big movie studios\\' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \\ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \\nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \\neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i\\'d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \\nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \\nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \\n',\n"," b\"running time approximately 1hr 40mins \\nreviewed by jack choo \\nrating : \\nthe movie starts with a rather se7en-ish opening sequence , rather cool and sets the mood for things to come . \\nthe story propels the audience into a neo-reality ; somewhat very close to conscious reality but laced with weird tinges of blue and red . \\nexistenz is actually the name of a new virtual-reality game . \\nsupposedly , vr games are highly popular as is considered a legal-drug in this neo-reality . \\n * * * * ( leigh ) is the ultimate game creator and introduces her ultimate game-experience in the form of existenz . \\nplayers are required to have bio-ports embedded in their spine , which plugs to a game-pod in order to enjoy the immersive experience . \\nduring a secretive beta-testing-cum-teaser meeting for this new game , an assassination attempt on * * * life occurs and she runs off with fellow bodyguard * * * ( law ) . \\n * * * is more of a realists than anything else , afraid that he'll lose reality if he begin to play these games but * * * requires his help to immerse together with her into existenz to check if the program is still functioning properly after the assassination attempt . \\nas they soon discover , they are transported between realities within existenz uncovering more than they initially expected . \\nexistenz has all the cronenberg-gore that is expected of him . \\neven so , this film is no-where near his cult classics such as videodrome or scanners . \\nnot even half as suspenseful as the commercially successful the fly . \\nexistenz can probably be looked upon as his 90's version of videodrome , even so , it is a poor follow-up . \\nwhile in most of his famed films , his penchant for gore always hit the right note with theme of the film and plot . \\nin existenz , the gory sequences are no more attached to spirit of the film and seem to be an act of over-indulgence than anything else . \\njennifer jason leigh and jude law , both commendable actors , looked aloof and miss-directed throughout the entire film . \\nthe scripting and acting barely pulls the film out of the b-grade category . \\nit was obvious that cronenberg worked on a really tight-budget and it seems that he handled that pretty well in the production design and values created for this film ( the opening sequence , though , probably formed a considerable portion of the budget ! ) \\nwhich is actually quite good . \\nexistenz is too predictable and cliched in these times . \\n10 years ago , it would have been another classic for cronenberg . \\ncronenberg fans however , ( those people who enjoy seeing friends getting queasy over mutilation on film ) should not give this film a miss as some form of appreciation can still be offered by you . \\n\",\n"," b\"a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings

ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy . \\nthe movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? \\n- and written by brad kaaya , is very grim . \\nan air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits . \\nand that is how it should be . \\nof all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery . \\nkaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts . \\nthe young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin . \\nplus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood . \\nthe script follows the familiar lines of the classic . \\nhugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game . \\nit all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved . \\nthe performances in o vary . \\nphifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease . \\nhe also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system . \\nhartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover . \\nstiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight . \\nthe film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging . \\nalso desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo's machinations , is puzzling . \\nwhy she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back . \\nit is irrational . \\nbut these are minor carpings . \\noverall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation . \\nif nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature . \\n\",\n"," b\"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \\nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \\nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \\nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \\ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \\nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . \\ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \\nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \\nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . \\nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \\nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \\nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \\naudiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \\nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \\nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \\ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \\nwhat he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . \\na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \\nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . \\nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \\ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \\nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \\nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \\nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \\nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \\nit doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \\nthere's a word for people like you , nicolas . \\nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \\noffender .

we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny . \\nthere's the occasional good one liner , but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour . \\nthe film , after all these silly gags , then suddenly turns sentimental , and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous . \\nthe court scene at the end of the film is useless and unbelievable , and not helped by the soppy overacting . \\nit's a poor attempt to win over the audience . \\nadam sandler basically plays the same role he has in his last few films ( except the wedding singer . ) \\njoey lauren adams is much , much better , and deserves a far better film than this trash . \\nsteve buscemi pops up in a funny cameo , and his scenes are pretty funny . \\nrob schneider is also funny as a crazy delivery man . \\nthe two twins who play julian are o . k , they start out rather well , but then becoming annoying and brattish halfway through and finally turn 'all american' wholesome goodness at the end of the film , where the tear juice is turned up high . \\nbig daddy is really nothing special , and is not even worth it for a few chuckles . \\nalthough it is actually well put together , with nice direction , good production design and even some montages , this professionalism can't help the fact that the script and characters are trash . \\nbig

with a confession : i love cop movies . \\ni adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998\\'s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven . \\nwas it any good ? \\nwell , just about as good as baldwin\\'s steven seagal impression ( for those i\\'ve confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) . \\nnow let me clarify , i don\\'t love just any cop movie ; i\\'m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80\\'s and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker . \\ni\\'m partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection . \\nproblem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a \" true \" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail . \\nso what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? \\ntruth is i\\'m a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches . \\nyes it\\'s all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i\\'m guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from . \\nas little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe\\'s , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos . \\nas an adult my tastes haven\\'t changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a \" guy \" film could potentially bring . \\nnow what if it\\'s the cops who\\'re the corrupt ones ? \\nooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain . \\nthrow a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) \\ninto the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city . \\nhow absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? \\nso damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . \\nthe film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . \\nsince i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn\\'t . \\n ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . \\nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn\\'t make it to where he should have . \\n ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . \\nhere , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino\\'s in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . \\nwilliams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york . \\nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . \\nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . \\nthe squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . \\ndanny has done this , and though he\\'s a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . \\nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a \" double agent \" . \\nhe does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . \\nright away we know that that is exactly what he\\'ll have to do . \\nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . \\nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . \\nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? \\nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . \\nlumet\\'s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . \\nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . \\nlumet\\'s worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . \\nthis isn\\'t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet\\'s most recent cop \\\\ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . \\nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . \\nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . \\nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . \\nof course cop movies aren\\'t popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn\\'t gay , the lame comic relief character who\\'s never funny , and on and on . \\nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \\\\ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . \\nit focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . \\nthere\\'s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he\\'s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . \\nthis is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . \\nin the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . \\nhe\\'s lost his voice . \\ndoes that little itty bitty detail matter ? \\nmaybe not to most , but it sure made my night . \\nand in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it\\'s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things . \\n',\n"," b'mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . \\nhis entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen

dollars . \\nduring this scene , i turned to my friend and said , \" wow . \\nthat\\'s some ape . \" \\njoe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . \\nhe runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . \\nhe picks things up and stares at them pensively . \\nhe breaks things on accident , because he\\'s just too big to avoid clumsiness . \\njoe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . \\nas a character , he doesn\\'t quite register . \\nand the story he\\'s been put in is as limp as they come . \\nthe words \" family entertainment \" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . \\nthe picture is a remake of the 1949 film . \\nit\\'s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . \\nthe main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . \\nas a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . \\nspecifically , she\\'s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . \\nsoon , zoologist gregg o\\'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill\\'s mother . \\nso , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . \\nin addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . \\nand , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill\\'s mother . \\njill , of course , doesn\\'t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . \\nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . \\nthe movie isn\\'t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . \\nbut the story is really dumb , there aren\\'t any characters , and the film isn\\'t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . \\nthe movie also has bad dialogue . \\nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it\\'s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like \" joe isn\\'t happy ! \" \\nand \" joe isn\\'t safe here ! \" \\n \" we need to get joe out of here ! \" \\n \" joe is way too big for that cage ! \" \\ni don\\'t know if these phrases are word for word , but they\\'re close . \\nas i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . \\npaxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . \\nsadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . \\nthere are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . \\nit\\'s certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . \\nbut adults in the audience aren\\'t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . \\na big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . \\nnobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . \\n',\n"," b\"capsule :

illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \\njim carrey\\'s signed on too ? \\neven better . \\nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \\nsuch a

would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \\nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\\'t funny . \\nit\\'s not for lack of trying . \\nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \\nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \\nsoon enough , charlie\\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank ,

he\\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \\nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \\nsome have suggested that this isn\\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\\' brand of humor doesn\\'t require plot to work . \\nthey\\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\\' last effort , 1996\\'s \" there\\'s something about mary

to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \\nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \\nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \\nbut they haven\\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \\nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \\n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \\nyeah , me too . ) \\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck ; it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\nthis doesn\\'t really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire .

arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . \\nthey should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . \\nthe same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . \\nthat is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . \\ngary \" gal \" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has

mellis\\'s and david scinto\\'s script that should have been caught before filming . \\nwhen we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . \\nbeyond an ability to

vault , flooding the vault . \\nno only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . \\nin spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . \\ni know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . \\nthe story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . \\nthe old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . \\nit is not a great plot . \\nin sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . \\nperhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . \\nit is an old plot dressed up to look new . \\nif the plot is old , at least the style is creative . \\nthis is director jonathan glazer\\'s first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . \\nhis style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . \\ncinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . \\nwe see one side of a person\\'s faces . \\nbut the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . \\nhalf of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . \\nwe yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . \\nat least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . \\nsexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . \\nthe plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . \\nfurther respectability comes from ben kingsley\\'s high-powered performance . \\ni give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n"," b'perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . \\nthere is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . \\nwhereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . \\nthe latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers\\' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie\\'s story . \\nunlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . \\nit runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film\\'s length . \\ncontrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . \\nin this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . \\nwith its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . \\nthe script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . \\nbut , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . \\nthe viewers don\\'t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . \\nand right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . \\nas the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . \\nbillions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- \" farms \" our life energy . \\nonly a select group of individuals knows of the \" real \" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \\nmorpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . \\nthe cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . \\nthe set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . \\nthe costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . \\nfor instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of \" agents \" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . \\nthe casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn\\'t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . \\nsupports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . \\none of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year\\'s science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would\\'ve worked from a different approach . \\nthe alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . \\nthe better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . \\n',\n","

oh yeah , true love . \\ngeorge clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth . \\nhe plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other . \\nnowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style . \\nclooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty . \\nclooney

but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie . \\nthe relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story . \\nthe leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception . \\nalthough they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it . \\nout of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times . \\nthis is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves . \\nthe entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own ,

british tv , \" red dwarf \" fans should look for chris \" rimmer \" barrie in his first major film role ) . \\n',\n"," b'john sayles\\' \" men with guns \" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power . \\nthe film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers . \\nmost of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists . \\nall people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness . \\nhowever , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity . \\nthere is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it . \\nthe film\\'s main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category . \\none of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive . \\nfuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians . \\nwith government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate . \\nthis program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea . \\nhowever , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned . \\nas he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . \\nwhen dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , \" because they had guns , and we didn\\'t . \" \\nrational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others\\' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . \\ndr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . \\nfirst , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . \\nnext , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . \\nthrough his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . \\nalong the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . \\nas domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . \\nlast , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn\\'t spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . \\nsayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in \" men with guns . \" \\n ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) \\nhe creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . \\ntheir uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film\\'s overarching theme of violence as power - domingo\\'s attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes\\' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn\\'t ) . \\nthe setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . \\nsayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in \" matewan \" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in \" lone star \" ( 1996 ) . \\nsayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( \" gattaca \" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . \\nsayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . \\nthe one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . \\nit would not be a stretch to say that \" men with guns \" is a depressing film . \\nin fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . \\nin addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo\\'s inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . \\nnevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . \\nthe last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , \" nobody refuses the men with guns . \" \\n',\n"," b'one of the responses those that enjoy \" detroit rock city \" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i\\'ve given the film might be something like : \" oh , that casey\\'s gone and become a jaded critic on us . \\njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n\\' roll movie like this ? \" \\ni\\'m wondering the same thing . \\ni feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" \\nit\\'s the sort of movie i wish i could\\'ve had a lot of fun with , but i didn\\'t . \\ni just didn\\'t . \\nsurely this film isn\\'t trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \\nno , but i expected something . \\na funny joke . \\na clever prank . \\na plot development . \\nanything . \\nthe movie never delivers . \\nyou\\'ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \\n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film\\'s existence , and it\\'s not a very satisfying realization . \\nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \\nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \\nthey have a garage band . \\nthey\\'re pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n\\' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \\nthey have tickets , they lose them . \\nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \\nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \\nthere\\'s not much more to it . \\nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys\\' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \\noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \\nshe doesn\\'t want them to see kiss , if you hadn\\'t figured that out already . \\nit\\'s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \\nwe\\'ve got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \\nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \\n \" detroit rock city \" doesn\\'t quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \\nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \\nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc\\'s \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor\\'s cat coughed up ) . \\nit\\'s also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it\\' s evident that they\\'re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \\nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they\\'ve got to make a living in hollywood . \\npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \\ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \\ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn\\'t got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \\nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \\nit\\'s fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \\ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \\ni haven\\'t felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \\nand what about that script ? \\nit\\'s written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i\\'ve ever heard . \\nif it is , i can\\'t say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \\na plotless , pointless rock n\\' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \\nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \\nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \\nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \\nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don\\'t provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \\nit\\'s as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \\nfunny ! \"

style points . \\nwhen that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : \" literary . \" \\nwhat\\'s eating gilbert grape ? \\nis such a film . \\nit\\'s a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence . \\ngilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities . \\nas the man of the house since his father\\'s suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store . \\nhe also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) . \\ngilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down . \\nas he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing . \\nslowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people . \\ndirector lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges\\' screenplay , based on his own novel . \\nendora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else . \\nthe midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real . \\nminor characters , like crispin glover as the town\\'s mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen\\'s desperately unhappy housewife . \\none of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band . \\nnot a single note in the depiction of endora rang false . \\nthe same can be said of the character of gilbert . \\nit\\'s testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert\\'s description of his father with , \" i knew someone like that once . \" \\ngilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty . \\nin one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction . \\nhis entire life seems to be mocked by arnie\\'s repeated chants of , \" we\\'re not going anywhere , \" but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father\\'s footsteps in this regard . \\njohnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands . \\ndepp\\'s performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio\\'s astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie . \\nhe puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real . \\ndicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw . \\ndarlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert\\'s tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert\\'s sisters . \\nonly juliette lewis doesn\\'t quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark . \\ngilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me . \\nthanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait . \\n',\n"," b'instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as \" powerful \" or \" touching \" . \\ni have a name for it myself : \" gross \" . \\nthis is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the \" rebel \" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too . \\nhow that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren\\'t present day moviegoers beyond being \" inspired \" by something like that ? \\nthis is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience\\'s intelligence . \\ninstinct\\'s plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa . \\nhe was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him . \\nafter committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison\\'s \" psychotics ward \" . \\nassigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) . \\ncaulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career . \\nof course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison . \\nand then there\\'s the inevitable \" heartless meanie \" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder\\'s mentor . \\nhe cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell . \\nlet\\'s get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . \\nany good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way . \\nnot good old theo . \\nno , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says \" we need to talk about this right now . \" \\nthis is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct\\'s already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it\\'s also the least of its problems . \\ndirector jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie\\'s promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs . \\nit\\'s not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) . \\nit aims to \" inspire \" rather than to touch hearts . \\nas yoda would say , inspire it does not . \\nit is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie\\'s story . \\nindeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film\\'s plot to another character . \\nthis , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence . \\ni am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation . \\ni think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever . \\noscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful . \\nhis performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink . \\ni liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling . \\ni love animals , and instinct\\'s prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with . \\nhowever this movie\\'s execution is completely unacceptable . \\ntone down the violence and this will be a chick flick . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov \\n',\n"," b\"dear god , this is a fantastically bad film ! \\nregardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words . \\nyou have to see it and experience it for yourself . \\nhere's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so . \\nyes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure . \\nin fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story . \\ndon't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off . \\nit reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was . \\nit also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme . \\nit does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark . \\nas i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness . \\nnow , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess . \\ni don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off . \\nfor the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing . \\ni paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) . \\ni don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film . \\nray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem . \\nrob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film . \\nlela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once ! \\nin fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do . \\nin that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense . \\nbut what a strange mess it is . \\nit was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours . \\ncan this be the same man ? \\ni don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time . \\nknock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here . \\nfor instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong . \\nwhy ? \\nwho knows . \\nwhat are the implications of this ? \\ni have no idea . \\nmost action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . \\nknock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . \\nthe acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . \\nsorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . \\nvan damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . \\nthe only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . \\ntsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . \\nthey're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . \\nbut his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed . \\nlots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character . \\nbut did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ? \\ni hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought . \\nknock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania . \\nif it were boring , i'd give it zero stars . \\nbut it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent . \\nit's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny . \\na bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted . \\ni recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can't deny it's zany , useless charm . \\noh , i know , they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts . \\nit's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful . \\n\",\n"," b'note : ordinarily , moviereviews . org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as

chooses a zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish . \\nthe first hour of music of the heart is rather painful . \\nroberta\\'s character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat . \\nalso lacking depth is the film\\'s \" bad guy , \" a narrow-minded music teacher ( josh pais ) who rejects roberta out of principle ( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is ) and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around . \\nthe next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre . \\nthey are highlighted by one child\\'s return to roberta\\'s class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can\\'t be around anymore because \" my mom said . . . \" ) and a glowing concert . \\nnot knowing the running time , you may expect the credits to role at this point . \\nbut they don\\'t . \\ninstead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent . \\ndirector wes craven , known for his works of horror , uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing . \\none romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic \" but . . . \\nlast night . . . \" \\nand roberta\\'s two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father\\'s absence . \\nthe city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie . \\nroberta\\'s mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype . \\nthe noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens ; predictably one of roberta\\'s students is gunned down and killed off screen . \\none thing the film does lack is subtlety . \\nthe fact that a little boy was playing \" we shall overcome \" on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference . \\nthe fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience . \\n ( of course , in horror films the foreshadowing and between-the-line moments are meant to be overdone , so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game . ) \\neven with all its flaws , music of the heart is a beautiful film . \\nthat is not an excuse for the movie\\'s poor beginning . \\nbut as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall , i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage . \\nin december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history . \\nthe performance included a dead-on elvis impression , robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies . \\nso , how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life ? \\nhe had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience . \\nperhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa\\'s favorite food , this movie has an amazing finale . \\n',\n"," b'in the past , tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman , and the hilarious ed wood , but lately his films just don\\'t cut it . \\nsleepy hollow has some unique features , but the script is a terrible mess . \\nfor those who remember disney\\'s fantastic \" adventures of ichabod crane \" , it is actually superior to this . \\ndisney\\'s version was at least interesting , while burton\\'s film drags on far too long , without any suspense or frights . \\nwhile the stories are similar , the new version adds too much to the once likable story , and throws in some weak dialogue to top it off . \\nichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is now apparently a constable , who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders . \\nthe victims are headless , and no traces of evidence were found , until the murderer reveals himself , hence the headless horseman . \\nnow with the help of christina ricci and an orphaned boy , they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree , that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow . \\nsure the headless horseman is an intriguing character , but the story has so many holes that even he nor depp can save this disaster . \\nin the original , the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable . \\nno one could stop him , not even ichabod . \\nby the end of the film , it had audiences in deep thought . \\nburton however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere , and how to make the main characters heroes . \\nhe takes no risk what so ever , and this is where he fails . \\nanother pathetic element of the film was the script . \\nlike i said earlier , he just stuffed too much in at one time , and made it look real sloppy , kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims . \\nhe completely butchered the story to pieces . \\nthankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked . \\nthe acting by depp was quite notable . \\nhe took the nerdy character of the cartoon , and simply acted it out in a better manner . \\nif it wasn\\'t for his quirky one-liners , i doubt i could have remained awake , because quite frankly i was getting sleepy . \\njust when i thought christina ricci was getting to be a good actress , she winds up doing this . \\nit just goes to show no actress or actor can pass up a big blockbuster . \\nit\\'s too tempting to let go , even if the script is mush . \\nthe atmosphere too was quite involving . \\ni should have just gazed at the sets , and the eerie fog , rather than actually pay attention to what was going on . \\nat least burton\\'s films are eye candy , even if they are trash . \\nthe only real scenes of value were the tree full of heads , and the fight between the horseman , depp and casper van dien . \\nother than that , i wish i could just fast forward through all the gaping holes in the film , and just sit back and stare at the scenery . \\nby the end , i can only think back and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed . \\nthis is the biggest disappointment of the year , especially when such a talented director like burton handles a project like this . \\ndon\\'t waste your time or money , because your head will feel hollow . \\n',\n"," b'the premise of the new james wong film , final destination , is that alex browning , the protagonist , prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane , thereby cheating fate . \\nhowever , fate is not so easily bested , and alex\\'s friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances . \\nessentially , this premise is a clever-way to make a slasher-flick without the slasher . \\nunfortunately , this is practically the only clever thing about the film . \\nas far as teen horror flicks go , final destination is better than many . \\nthere is enough shocking death , graphic gore , and requisite black humor to provide the essential \" roller coaster \" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick . \\nunfortunately , this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre . \\nthe relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set-up the next death . \\nthe scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed . \\nif you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date , this film might do the trick . \\nother than that , wait until it goes into heavy-rotation on cable . \\n',\n"," b'a new entry in the \" revisionist history \" genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation\\'s biggest presidential scandal . \\nkirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene\\'s watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in . \\nwhen they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers . \\nthe girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with . \\nwhen they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned . \\nduring a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president\\'s resignation . \\nthis film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of \" deep throat \" . \\nfrom there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad \" dick \" joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy . \\nat one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial . \\nthe band manages to stop right as dunst screams \" you have to stop letting dick run your life ! \" \\nmuch to the horror of everyone standing within earshot . \\nseveral other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film . \\nif this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it\\'s juvenile bathroom humor , but it\\'s not . \\nthe film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience\\'s throat in the least subtle way possible . \\ni don\\'t recall oliver stone\\'s nixon having to pander to it\\'s audience , but of course that film wasn\\'t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience . \\nthe only redeeming thing about this movie is it\\'s remarkable supporting cast . \\ni wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch\\'s woodward and bernstein . \\nthose two characters are the sole basis for my rating . \\ni wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour . \\ntheir constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch\\'s constant thwarting of ferrell\\'s attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy\\'s brother ) . \\nthe other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with . \\ni\\'d like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities . \\nas for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better . \\nthey come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best . \\nstay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie . \\nan excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie . \\nless of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds . \\nas it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as \" dick and poopie \" jokes . \\nand that , to me , does not make a funny movie . \\n[pg-13] \\n',\n"," b'director luis mandoki\\'s last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama \" when a man loves a woman , \" but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , \" message in a bottle , \" which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up . \\neverything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there\\'s an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , \" meaningful \" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through . \\n \" message in a bottle \" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day . \\ninside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper . \\nsoon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message . \\nof course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa\\'s age and played by kevin costner . \\nshe is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett\\'s late wife who died a few years earlier . \\ndo you think you know where this is headed ? \\nmost likely you do , and i wouldn\\'t call it giving away anything to say that by the picture\\'s end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn\\'t buy for a second . \\nif there are any positive things to say about \" message in a bottle , \" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett\\'s stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , \" shaggy dog \" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city . \\nmeanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently . \\nit seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn\\'t want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea . \\nthe other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the \" friend \" roles , here playing penn\\'s confidante and co-worker at the tribune . \\nthe first half of \" message in a bottle \" plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time \" getting to know \" garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining . \\nusually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt \" written , \" and not as if people were really \" talking . \" \\nwhen the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble . \\ni swear that while watching \" message in a bottle , \" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i\\'m not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) . \\nalways one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing . \\nnobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa\\'s secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after . \\nthis same exact problem occurred in last year\\'s very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , \" city of angels . \" \\nalthough theresa is deeply touched by the \" heartfelt \" letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began . \\nit should have read , \" memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! \" \\n',\n"," b'i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn\\'t need a sequel . \\nbeloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting . \\nif disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn\\'t show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action . \\ntoy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney\\'s standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film . \\nas someone who doesn\\'t believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that\\'s because they\\'re made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking . \\nfortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical sequel . \\nlucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level . \\n ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film\\'s elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house\\'s new cachet in hollywood . ) \\nvisually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer-generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy . \\nfortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them . \\nas before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child\\'s absence . \\nwhile the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy\\'s life is to mean something to its owner . \\none of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors . \\nmost often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they\\'re not even removed from their packaging . \\nimagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you\\'ll understand the attitudes of the collector\\'s items that show up in this movie . \\nsheriff woody ( voiced by a note-perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy\\'s toys who was challenged in the previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside . \\nthis accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence . \\nthose anxieties are crystallized when andy\\'s mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale . \\nand there\\'s an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum . \\nthe rest of andy\\'s toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him . \\nthat this film manages to turn a box marked \" 25 cents \" into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys . \\noperating on this level of abstraction , toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness . \\n ( the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan , who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark . ) \\nsometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard . \\nthere\\'s somewhat less of the seat-of-the-pants loopiness that energized the first film , allowing it to surprise and excite on a near-constant basis , and more philosophizing about toys , collectors , the nature of happiness and the meaning of life . \\nwhile that leads to fewer bellylaughs , it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion . \\n ( just don\\'t ask why andy\\'s favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957 . ) \\nwhere else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al\\'s toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers , buzz lightyear action figures ? \\nforget the self-congratulatory science fiction of the matrix -- this is a fundamental mind-bender for buzz , and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight . \\nhere , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children\\'s tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face-to-face with god . \\nin sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death . \\nsignificantly , the film\\'s very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening-night crowd in a near-uproar . \\nand toward the end , when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys , one of them observes , with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking , that it will be fun while it lasts . \\nso toy story 2 joins the tradition of children\\'s stories , largely neglected of late , that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence . \\nwhat\\'s really striking is that both toy story films ( and , to a lesser degree , pixar\\'s a bug\\'s life ) are kids\\' movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts , not to mention whatever piece of tot-friendly eye-candy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer . \\nit puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros . animation . \\ni\\'m not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention -- they love traditional narrative too much -- but , boy , it makes me wonder what they might come up with next . \\n-------------------------------------------------------------- directed by john lasseter , colin brady , ash

cinematic achievement . \\nin about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a

that\\'s needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich ? s . \\ni can\\'t wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd . \\nobviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball . \\nit stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an

non-fiction book , is that there aren\\'t any . \\nthe movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie . \\nthat wouldn\\'t be so bad , if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them . \\nmost of the kids\\' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised . \\nthere\\'s little that\\'s naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling . \\nthe worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger player ( dewayne warren ) whose sole purpose , as the movie unfolds , is being an emotional pawn , a tactic so utterly despicable i can\\'t find the right words to express myself . \\nthe adults also don\\'t fare well . \\nreeves is impressively uninspiring as the down-on-his-luck loser . \\nthe character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma-free performance . \\nevery time he speaks , he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up . \\nkids are supposed to rally around this guy ? \\ndiane lane , who co-stars as reeves\\' obligatory love interest , remains a glowing screen presence ( see my dog skip for better proof ) . \\nit\\'s too bad that her role here

buddy and other unoriginal characters you\\'ve seen before and hope never to see again . \\ni wanted hardball to be good . \\nrobbins\\' varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved . \\ni haven\\'t seen robbins\\' goofy ready to rumble in its entirety , but i am intrigued that \" macho man \" randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions . \\nrobbins obviously needs to go back to his forte -- making sports movies for guys and not cutesy , cuddly pap such as hardball , which also manages to annoy and insult the audience . \\nhere\\'s hoping that happens in the immediate future . \\n',\n"," b\"it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office . \\na poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . \\nin directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie . \\nin addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types . \\nthe two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together . \\njackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts . \\nthe other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one . \\nchan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time . \\nchris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan's performance . \\nhe works perfectly with the script , and it's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines . \\nalmost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent . \\nwe're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd . \\ncut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters . \\nthe fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help . \\nthe fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective . \\nit's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up . \\nrattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year's grosse pointe blank . \\nthere are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback . \\nalso , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing . \\nhowever , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background . \\nalmost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it's tucker's toned-down routine or chan's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types . \\na recommendable visit to the theater , indeed . \\n\",\n"," b'melvin van peebles\\' \" sweet sweetback\\'s baadasssss song \" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . \\nit was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . \\nits violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . \\nin style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , \" sweet sweetback \" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . \\nvan peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built \" sweet sweetback \" from the ground up almost entirely by himself . \\nbecause no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . \\nthe movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . \\nvan peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film\\'s responsibilities himself . \\nhe wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . \\nhe was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . \\nfor instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases \" rated x by an all-white jury , \" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . \\nhe also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . \\nthe storyline in \" sweet sweetback \" is deceptively simple . \\nit takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . \\none day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they\\'re bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . \\nhowever , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . \\nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . \\nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . \\nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles\\' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . \\nvan peebles\\' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . \\nat the beginning of \" sweet sweetback , \" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : \" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . \" \\nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . \\nof course , with today\\'s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , \" sweet sweetback \" doesn\\'t seem all that revolutionary . \\nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . \\nat that time , \" sweet sweetback \" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . \\ndistributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles\\' words , gave the black audience \" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . \" \\nof course , once it caught on , it caught on big . \\n \" sweet sweetback \" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates \" sweetback \" from other movies like \" shaft \" ( 1972 ) and \" the mack \" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . \\n \" sweet sweetback \" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . \\nhowever , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , \" sweet sweetback \" is certainly not without its controversies . \\nwhen it was first released , an article was published in \" ebony \" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . \\nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . \\nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . \\nstill others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . \\nnevertheless , a movie like \" sweet sweetback \" cannot be made without conflicting points of view . \\nit is a revolutionary movie not because it\\'s about one man\\'s defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . \\nuntil that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . \\nthe fact that \" sweet sweetback \" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply \" the black community \" ) . \\nvan peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between \" sweet sweetback \" and all movies that had come before it . \\nwhen the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . \\nnear the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , \" oh lord , let him die . \\ndon\\'t let them kill him . \\nlet him die on his own . \" \\nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn\\'t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . \\nand , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : \" watch out ! \\na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . \" \\nbeyond the political aspects , \" sweet sweetback \" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . \\nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . \\nhe shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . \\nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . \\nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . \\nwatching \" sweet sweetback \" more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . \\narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . \\nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect . \\nthe legacy of \" sweet sweetback\\'s baadasssss song \" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him . \\n',\n"," b\"it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback . \\nof course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work , i'd probably be willing to take risks as well , but that's neither here nor there . \\npayback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin . \\nthe film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don't know yet . \\nall we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences . \\nit turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters . \\nobviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers . \\nporter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val . \\ngibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn't mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants . \\nyou probably wouldn't see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won't be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) . \\nharrison ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won't mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? \\nthis is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . \\nwhile he isn't the sort of character you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of , he's nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are . \\nporter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . \\npayback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be remembered as being among gibson's most important work , but is still one of the finer films he's done . \\nthe only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? \\nthe ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn't ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies . \\nthe film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes . \\na fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . \\njust be ready for a possible letdown of an ending . \\n\",\n"," b'the classic story & the production which ruined it \\nmarking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel . \\nof course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title . . ) . \\nthe story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea . \\ndouglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr . moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize . \\nhis host\\'s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau\\'s lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress . \\neven worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal \" people . \" \\ndouglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast-people community , which considers dr . moreau their maker . \\nusing shock-therapy and the law , dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled . \\nthe island of dr . \\nmoreau questions the ability of men playing god . \\ndr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence . . . but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long . \\nmoreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp . \\neven so , the production has failed to make the most out of it . \\nthere are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not \" prioritized \" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes . . . . rather \\nungloriously at times too . \\nperhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau\\'s creations . \\nthe two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably . \\nmore screen time could have been used for character interaction and development . \\ni really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr . moreau\\'s obsession , montgomery\\'s purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast-people had to rebel . \\nmaybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to \" cut a long story short \" and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it\\'s still summer , and movies have to be \" marketable \" ) . \\nthe special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about . \\nat most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes . \\nthis h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film . \\nunfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to

hard , and mr . \\nmagoo . \\neven if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we\\'re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but \" top form \" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here . \\nthis is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation . \\nthe story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber . \\nthe cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often . \\nthe bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a

todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the \" spider-man \" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn . \\nmcfarlane\\'s \" spawn \" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s . \\nmcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max . \\nthe early \" spawn \" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane\\'s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing . \\nwith the popularity of \" spawn \" and the success of the current warner bros . \\'s batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn . \\nin the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series . \\nthis topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark . \\nwhat happened ? \\nwhy is spawn so bad ? \\ntodd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo . \\ni don\\'t think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film . \\ni place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology . \\nthese films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics . \\nhardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons . \\na lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don\\'t get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren\\'t engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) . \\nspawn\\'s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level . \\nmcfarlane\\'s spawn was a tortured hero . \\na mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda . \\nhaving died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda . \\nsimmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married . \\ndespite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn\\'t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld . \\nspawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so . \\nwhen the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching . \\nthe cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters . \\nspawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) . \\njohn leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . \\ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . \\nthe film , however , spends so much time on the violator\\'s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . \\napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator\\'s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . \\nleguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . \\nmichael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on . \\nmore time needed to be spent on white\\'s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . \\na special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . \\neasily the hammiest performance in the movie , it\\'s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now . \\nsheen\\'s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film . \\nmany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down . \\nmtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them . \\nflames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting . \\ncogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film . \\nhe goofily tells the audience , at one point , that \" how much of [spawn\\'s] humanity is left remains to be seen , \" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another . \\nthe music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue . \\nloud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes . \\nto be fair , however , marilyn manson\\'s \" long hard road out of hell \" effectively compliments spawn\\'s return to earth , while filter and the crystal method\\'s \" ( can\\'t you ) trip like i do \" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song . \\nfor as good a comic book as it is , \" spawn \" did not spawn a good movie . \\nspawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development . \\nit receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects . \\nmany other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better . \\nrated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn\\'t be appropriate for the very young . \\n',\n"," b'capsule : a science fiction allegory . \\nat the millennium a lethal contagious virus has hit taiwan . \\nofficials have cut off water and other services to the center of

emotionally punishing plan to get him back . \\nunfortunately , writer/director mark brown ( \" how to be a player \" ) breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy : you have to like the protagonist - and shrill , self-congratulatory shante smith is a smirking , superficial , spiteful shrew who doesn\\'t realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love . \\nhaving her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the \" day one , \" \" day two \" title-card device underscores the tedium . \\ncomic anthony anderson scores as chestnut\\'s boisterous best-friend , and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who\\'s given a smooth makeover by ms . robinson . \\nbut the out-takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself . \\non the

a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original . \\npart of the reason why the film doesn\\'t work , i think , is that while in the original the kids\\' quest for sex was a coming-of-age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness . \\nhere , everything has been cheapened . \\nthey behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking ;

richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies . \\noverall , that sums up \" the people vs . \\nlarry flynt . \" \\nthe film is a wildly entertaining hoot

in cincinnati . \\nthere he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life . \\nto bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine . \\nflynt , along with the magazine\\'s rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody\\'s real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt . \\nthey mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on \" what guys really want , \" explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor . \\nthe film\\'s prime example of hustler\\'s attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt\\'s \" naughtiness . \" \\ndirector milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine\\'s frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons . \\nflynt\\'s rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives . \\nan obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law . \\nlawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt\\'s wife . \\nnorton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt\\'s increasingly childish and bizarre behavior . \\nin court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell . ) \\nas keating blathers about flynt\\'s immorality , the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag , inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating , who was later convicted in a $2 billion s&l fraud . \\nflynt\\'s other prime foe is rev . jerry falwell , who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse . \\ntragedy strikes

\\nflynt eventually kicks drugs , but leasure succumbs to addiction , and later , aids . \\nafter watch falwell on tv , describing aids as a punishment from god , flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court , leading to the film\\'s climactic courtroom scene . \\n \" the people vs , larry flynt \" is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt . \\n \" if they\\'ll protect a scumbag like me , then they\\'ll protect all of you , \" declared flynt . \\nhe\\'s right , of course , but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons . \\nhe also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt . \\nharrelson is an attractive , charismatic man , and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero . \\neven a cursory look at the real flynt , who is making the talk show circuit , and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene , shows a bloated , morose and bitter man . \\nan accurate

the best film of 1997 , is a wonderful piece of contemporary neo-noir filmmaking . \\nfor a textbook example of how to take all the elements of neo-noir and create an absolute mess , there\\'s \" palmetto . \" \\nbased on \" just another sucker , \" a short story written by british author rene raymond under the pseudonym james hadley chase , \" palmetto \" shows what happens when a filmmaker puts style ahead of substance . \\ndirector volker schlondorff ( \" tin drum , \" the handmaid\\'s tale \" ) stated \" we weren\\'t even sure for a long time if it was going to be a thriller or a comedy . \" \\nit shows . \\n \" palmetto \" is too preposterous too be taken seriously as a thriller and too ponderous to work as a comedy . \\nthe story begins when journalist harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is released from prison . \\nsomeone turned state\\'s witness and revealed that harry was framed , a \" reward \" for blowing the lid on corruption in the small florida town of palmetto . \\nbitter and broke , harry plans to hitchhike to miami and start his life over , but ex-girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) appears to return him to palmetto . \\nwhile hanging out at a bar , he notices that a beautiful woman has left her purse in a phone booth . \\nharry pockets her cash , only to have the woman reappear and catch him with her money in his pocket . \\nno problem , though . \\nthe radiant blonde is rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue , ) the young wife of a very rich older man with heart problems , and she has a proposition for harry . \\nrhea needs \" a threatening voice and someone to collect the ransom \" for the staged kidnapping of her teenage stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny . ) \\nthe girls want to bilk a half-million dollar \" ransom \" from the old man and will happily give harry $50 , 000 for helping with the scam . \\nthings go wrong , of course . \\nodette is found dead , leaving harry frantically trying to dispose of the corpse and cover his tracks . \\nin an ironic twist , harry is asked to work for the local d . a . \\'s \\noffice . \\nthey need a press liaison to field questions about odette\\'s kidnapping and feel that harry is the perfect man for the job . \\nnot a bad set-up for a noir film , if only schlondorff knew how to handle the material , but he never settles on a consistent tone . \\nthe actors don\\'t know what to do with their characters either , muddling the proceedings even further . \\nas if that wasn\\'t enough , the story suffers from major problems in logic . \\nwoody harrelson is a talented actor with an admirable willingness to take on risky parts , but he\\'s lost here . \\npresented as a crusading journalist who was horribly wronged , it makes no sense that harry would be stupid and dishonest enough to get caught up in this scheme . \\nharrelson clearly doesn\\'t know what to do with harry\\'s character , so he spends most of the film glowering , sweating and generally acting miserable . \\nmeanwhile , elisabeth shue gives a goofy performance , behaving like a vamp on nitrous oxide . \\nas the stepdaughter , chloe sevigny lays on so many slurpy quirks that she comes off like juliette lewis jr . despite a number of steamy scenes , there\\'s no chemistry between harrelson and the women . \\nto make matters worse , schlondorff badly dubs in dialogue while the character\\'s lips are running over each others bodies . \\ntwo particularly bad scenes highlight the film\\'s problems . \\nwhile driving with a body in his trunk , harry has a minor car wreck and a cop shows up . \\nthe officer wants to help change harry\\'s flat tire and asks him to open the trunk . \\nharry\\'s pathetic attempts to keep the trunk closed might have worked if played as comedy , but under schlondorff\\'s grim direction , the scene is just embarrassing . \\nthe film\\'s nadir comes when a bad guy prepares to kill harry and nina . \\nwe\\'re supposed to be horrified watching our hero dangling over a bathtub filled with acid , but by this point the film has foundered so badly that the scene is merely reminiscent of when jessica and roger rabbit were suspended over a vat of dip . \\nhad \" palmetto \" been played with tongue firmly in cheek , it might have been an entertaining shaggy dog story . \\nbut under the harsh direction of schlondorff , the film is just a sluggish paint-by-numbers exercise in neo- noir cluelessness . \\navoid this nonsense and go see \" l . a . confidential \" instead . \\n',\n"," b'it\\'s always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half-asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film . \\nthat about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression . \\nindeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes\\' name for making the original live-action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel . \\nthe main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians . \\nthe original made more than $100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of \" collectible \" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal-marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas . \\nwell , it\\'s been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it\\'s digitally enhanced . \\nhere\\'s the story . \\ncruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the \" cure \" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr . pavlov . \\n ( oh , how witty . ) \\nshe rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film . \\ncruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again . \\na kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula . \\nat this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater . \\nhow low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film\\'s villain ) sunk in the film business ? \\nit\\'s almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon . \\nand depardieu . . . \\nhow can a french guy have a bad french accent ? \\nand never mind the toilet brush haircut . \\nthe only minutely positive

musketeer . \" \\nfor some reason that i may figure out later , i don\\'t know why the time , money and effort were put into the making of \" the musketeer . \" \\nit may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film\\'s xin-xin xiong ( \" once upon a time in china \" ) and yuen woo-ping from \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \" \\nthe result is a mix of genres that don\\'t mesh well . \\nelements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 \" the three musketeers \" ) , the man with no name from \" a fistful of dollars \" ( d\\'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano . \\nthe result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the \" matrix \" crowd . \\nalexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters . \\nthe real problem with the \" the musketeer \" lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d\\'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) . \\nchambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o\\'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma . \\nsuvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen . \\nif \" the musketeer \" makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons . \\nstronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one . \\nthe supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive . \\ncatherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d\\'artagnan\\'s mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in \" the princess bride ) . \\nstephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character . \\ntim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal\\'s chief henchman , febre . \\nhe is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout . \\nthe rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , \" lock , stock and two smoking barrels \" ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d\\'artagnan\\'s aid when needed . \\npeter hyam\\'s does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well . \\na stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps . \\nphotography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d\\'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre\\'s henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d\\'artagnan\\'s folks years before . \\nit is all routine stuff . \\nthe renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap , defying gravity , up walls and from horse to horse . \\nit works in a sci-fi film like \" the matrix \" or in a classical fantasy like \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon \" but just calls attention to itself in \" the musketeer . \" \\nat one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used . \\nit did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed . \\nwith a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and i give it a d . \\n',\n"," b'the main problem with martin lawrence\\'s pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn\\'t seem to do anything except justify the woman\\'s actions . \\nthat is especially the case in lawrence\\'s darnell wright . \\nhe is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long . \\nnow don\\'t think i condone this just because i\\'m male . \\nmy philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her . \\ndarnell doesn\\'t think like this . \\nhe sleeps with these girls once and dumps them . \\nand by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , \" i\\'m supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? \" \\nafter all , it is largely darnell\\'s fault . \\nif he is lining up all these women , you\\'d think he\\'d have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does . \\nbut he doesn\\'t , so you get the sense that he\\'s not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb . \\nyou especially get this sense that he\\'s dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her . \\n ( i\\'d put my pants on in two seconds after that ! ) \\nnow , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it\\'s hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage . \\none final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with . \\nbrandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell\\'s \" immature play \" as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life . \\nbut all of a sudden she says yes . \\nbut when you listen to darnell\\'s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him ! \\nlawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies . \\nlook at this movie . \\nfour writers , as a result it\\'s too long ( two hours , when it could\\'ve easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn\\'t get along ) , all of which isn\\'t necessary . \\nthere are some bright spots , though . \\nwhitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot . \\nand there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they\\'re just not enough to sustain the film . \\n',\n"," b\"8mm is not going to enlighten your day . \\nit's a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence . \\nnot only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you'll require a lot of patience as well . \\nnicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late . \\nhe wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality . \\ncage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability . \\nat home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of . \\nhis new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband's safe . \\nthe film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered . \\nor so it seems . \\nwelles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth . \\nand the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head . \\nhe hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography . \\nmax knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , `you dance with the devil , the devil don't change . \\nthe devil changes you . ' \\nthese turn out to be very wise words . \\n8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution . \\nthe set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her . \\nthis is where everything goes awry . \\nalthough director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula . \\neverything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects . \\nalthough it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control . \\ncage is the film's sole flame of energy . \\nhis performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation . \\nstill , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand . \\nwelles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry . \\nthis is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film . \\nhe tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie . \\nwritten by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece . \\nfurthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ? \\nthe director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) . \\nthis putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side . \\n\",\n"," b'there is a striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \\nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \\nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \\nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \\nit is an important scene for several reasons . \\nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \\nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \\nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like \" angels in the outfield \" ( 1994 ) or \" michael \" ( 1996 ) . \\nthe angels here are stark and believable . \\nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god\\'s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \\nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \\nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \\nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \\n \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \\nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \\nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \\nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it\\'s not enough . \\nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \\nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . \\nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n . y . p . d . \\nblue \" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \\nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage\\'s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person\\'s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \\nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \\n \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender\\'s haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" \\nwenders\\' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \\nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \\nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn\\'t suffer extensive damage . \\nthis may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not an attempt to copy it . \\nand yet , \" city of angels \" is not a typical hollywood movie . \\nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \\nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \\nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \\nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \\nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \\ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \\nwhat is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \\nit\\'s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \\nit doesn\\'t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \\ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \\n____________________________________________ visit \"

devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that . \\njunior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman . \\nthese are the same men that brought us the very funny twins . \\nso foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins . \\nso much for hopes . \\nschwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy . \\nunfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding . \\nstill believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse . \\nso , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug . \\ntheir theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman . \\ndoes the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? \\nwell , it must have to the producers of junior . \\nadmittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off . \\nperhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny . \\nbut it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best . \\nthe sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny . \\nschwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics . \\ni kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture . \\nbetter yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ? \\nanything would have been better than this mess . \\ndanny devito is wasted in this movie . \\nhis part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street . \\n ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . ) \\nemma thompson is wasted here as well . \\nwhile thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian . \\ntoo bad she didn't get to use any of that talent here . \\nam i being too hard on this film ? \\ni don't think so . \\nschwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood . \\nwith a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film . \\nthey certainly managed here . \\nmaybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made . \\nif you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito's comedic talents . \\n\",\n"," b'despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995\\'s original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances . \\nso , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel\\'s stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is . \\nit would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse . \\nsomething is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i\\'m not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own ) . \\nthe alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs\\'s short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw ) . \\nthis alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film\\'s sil , but it\\'s close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find . \\nmeanwhile , scientist dr . laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes . \\nit doesn\\'t take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive . \\nit\\'s up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick\\'s uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does . \\n \" this isn\\'t the x-files , goddammit ! \" \\nexclaims one character in the early going . \\nin terms of quality , he\\'s absolutely right , but he\\'s also wrong . \\nthe new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick\\'s pupils to dilate once he\\'s infected . \\nlooks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files\\'s \" black cancer \" to me . \\nbut that\\'s not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from . \\nspecies was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original\\'s director , roger donaldson , did . \\nhuman patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve\\'s alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) . \\na large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ? \\naliens sans flamethrowers . \\nthe visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel\\'s effects crew at steve johnson\\'s xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here . \\nafter the effects , the original\\'s best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge . \\nhowever , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment . \\nat one point she\\'s called on to play alien \" empath \" ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she\\'s holed up in a glass cell . \\nby the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch . \\nso the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard . \\none problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control . \\nthe rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that . \\nhelgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along . \\nwilliamson suffers the worst indignity . \\nhe tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as \" i\\'m gonna get african on someone\\'s ass \" and not appear ridiculous ? \\nbut species ii\\'s worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work . \\nat least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger\\'s character performing fellatio on madsen\\'s , for a start . \\nbut the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level . \\nfor all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore . \\n',\n"," b'writing a screenplay for a

protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process . \\nthe trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner . \\nthis simple formula

hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way . \\nwithout that something extra -- whether it\\'s a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great

from today\\'s headlines . \\nit\\'s ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium . \\nthroughout the movie , we learn what the jackal\\'s plans are and how he intends to accomplish them . \\nno surprise . \\nthe fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal\\'s plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy . \\ninstead , we get two ( count \\'em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal\\'s plan just as if he\\'s frank black ( or more likely , just as if he\\'s been handed a copy of the script ) . \\nand we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight . \\nit\\'s like gere\\'s character is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwriters ) seem to know it . \\nand just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about , whether or not they are important to what he\\'s trying to do or not . \\nwhat\\'s more , in the last half of the movie , the jackal , supposedly a super-smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake , comes down with a major case of the stupids . \\nas for the performances . . . \\nbruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack , which is a major achievement , but not enough reason to see the movie . \\nhis disguises are good , but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer\\'s in the saint . \\nrichard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent , which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance . \\nsidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie -- not that his performance is bad or anything , it\\'s not , but it is sad that hollywood won\\'t use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent ( shoot to kill , sneakers ) . \\nwriting a good plot and a good screenplay , like i said , is hard , but it can be done . \\nit wasn\\'t done here . \\nit is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones . \\ndo not go see this movie . \\nyou\\'ll only encourage the producers to make more just like it . \\ninstead , stay home and rent day of the jackal , or in the line of fire , or a fire safety video , for crying out loud . \\nanything other

scared me , and i didn\\'t want to go see it . \\nhowever , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it . \\ni didn\\'t get a chance to do so , until now . \\nthe film , disney\\'s 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron . \\nit has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it . \\nthen , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran . \\ntaran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper\\' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) . \\none day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen\\'s thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest . \\nan evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location . \\ntaran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her . \\nalong the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings\\' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) . \\nwhen he hears hen wen\\'s squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . \\ntaran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king\\'s castle from far away . \\ntaran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . \\nhe manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . \\nthere , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . \\nalong the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . \\nthe three manage to escape the horned king\\'s castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic . \\nas they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen\\'s trail . \\nhe leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks\\' , to a whirlpool . \\nsuddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk . \\ntaran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . \\nhe then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . \\nwith the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . \\nit turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . \\nwhen taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword . \\ntaran agrees , much to eilonwy\\'s horror , but at least they get the black cauldron . \\nbut ? the cauldron can\\'t be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped . \\nthe only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive . \\nthings take a turn for the worse when the horned king\\'s henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . \\ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . \\njust when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . \\ntaran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away . \\ngurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . \\ntaran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . \\nhe kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . \\ntaran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king\\'s castle just as it self-destructs . \\nthe witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain\\' . \\nin response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . \\nthe trade is made ; gurgi\\'s seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . \\nas taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all ! \\nthe happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . \\nas spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . \\nbefore ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . \\nbringing this book to the screen was the studio\\'s fondest dream . \\nmiller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . \\nwhen micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . \\nby this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . \\nmany of the studio\\'s old men had retired or died . \\ntherefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . \\noriginally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . \\nthe film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied\\' from lloyd alexander\\'s chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney\\'s other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . \\nin addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart\\' and `unmemorable\\' , compared to other disney animated features . \\nbut whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million . \\nthe failure of the film grounded the studio\\'s animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio\\'s reputation . \\nthe next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn\\'t do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) . \\nonly with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . \\nas for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . \\nfinally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . \\nbecause of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? \\nthe people who had seen the film didn\\'t think so . \\nin fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . \\nfor a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . \\nfew people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn\\'t seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . \\nbut people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . \\nsomewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! \\' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . \\nbefore that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . \\nthose rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . \\neven still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . \\nsome felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn\\'t . \\nbut these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . \\nas for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn\\'t expect much at all . \\nin fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn\\'t think the film would ever be such a good film . \\nmuch to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , \" this is the same film everyone saw ? \\nthe one that flopped at the box office ? \\nthe one that critics and filmgoers alike called \" a bad movie \" ? \\nthis doesn\\'t seem like all of the above . \\ninstead , it\\'s a classic in its own right . \\nthe film has a wonderful cast of characters . \\nthere\\'s taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story\\'s hero . \\nthe critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true . \\nhe is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . \\nthere\\'s a likeable character here ! \\nnot that he\\'s the only likeable character in the film . \\nthere\\'s gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don\\'t quite hit it off at first . \\nbut another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film\\'s imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . \\nthe other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren\\'t quite as well rounded as they should be . \\nthe story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . \\nelmer bernstein\\'s music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . \\nthe animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . \\neven though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . \\noverall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . \\nfans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . \\nthere are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney\\'s other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . \\nfans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . \\neven though it doesn\\'t have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . \\nthat better chance has finally come . \\nwhatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney\\'s most proudest achievements . \\ni can\\'t help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ? \\n',\n"," b\"seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass . \\n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture] \\ndo you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ? \\neveryone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) . \\nthat seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways . \\nin order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors . \\nthese types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out . \\nhow they will all come together is the process the film deals with . \\ni'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general . \\nthe film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come . \\nwe meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent . \\nshe's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works . \\nmaybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed . \\nthings start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences . \\nthis agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug . \\nthe process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death . \\nnearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be . \\nonce the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle . \\nwhen the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling . \\nconsidering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today . \\nand so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting . \\nthe second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead . \\nsimon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined . \\nthe third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle . \\nwe're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna . \\nand many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were . \\ni'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film . \\nperhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking . \\nstill , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well : \\n ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment . \\nhe doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low . \\n ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . ' \\n ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre . \\nit's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . ' \\n ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner . \\n ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what

released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor . \\nunfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed . \\nas the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie . \\nit\\'s a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film . \\nduring this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website . \\nthe movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously . \\nwe see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies . \\nwe see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him . \\nwe see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him . \\nno explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again . \\ni had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie . \\nthe movie cuts again , this time to the present . \\nthe young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors\\' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there\\'s no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the \" blair witch hunt , \" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website . \\nwe meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience . \\nsteven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria . \\ntristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence . \\nshe is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly . \\n ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out . \\nhow did i know ? \\nbecause in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) \\nthe fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . \\nthey pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . \\nkim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . \\npresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it\\'s never explained . \\nthe party of five heads off into the woods as promised . \\nthey reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr\\'s house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night\\'s events . \\nthere is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . \\nthe movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . \\nsexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . \\nthis would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . \\nthe next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen\\'s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . \\nthe videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , \" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! \" \\nooh . \\nspooky . \\nthe team goes back to jeffrey\\'s house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . \\nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . \\nwacky hijinks ensue . \\ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . \\nthroughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about \" reverse , \" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . \\nwhen they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . \\n ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . \\nokay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , \\nnevermind . ) \\nthis movie was awful . \\nsimply awful . \\nthe characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . \\nerica is the nature-loving wiccan . \\ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . \\nsteven is the overbearing asshole . \\nkim is the antisocial goth girl . \\nold , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . \\nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? \\nbecause she\\'s pregnant ! \\nhow do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? \\nbecause she wears a lot of eye makeup ! \\nhow do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? \\nbecause he has jagged teeth and talks like he\\'s straight out of \" deliverance \" ! \\nthis is weak storytelling at its worst . \\nrather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action . \\nit didn\\'t work . \\non top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid . \\n ( \" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie . \\nlet\\'s get on a plane home . \" \\n \" no . \\ni am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what\\'s going on . \" \\n \" ok . \" ) \\nfrankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch . \\ni also felt that there was simply too much blood \\'n\\' gore in this film . \\nthe first movie worked by never showing us the horror . \\nthe witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact . \\nthe horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be . \\nthis is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie . \\nblair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out . \\nthis was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey\\'s throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort . \\nknives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care . \\nthis movie didn\\'t stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything . \\nby the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours . \\nit is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail . \\ni confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying . \\ni have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no \" monster , \" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind . \\ni found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director\\'s intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all . \\n ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so . \\nand if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ? \\nthe snowfall of manuscript paper ? \\nhm ? ) \\nblair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie . \\nfrom the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots , it was a bad effort through and through . \\n',\n"," b'the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form . \\nit\\'s been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre . \\nwhat makes \" peter\\'s friends \" so remarkable is not how it doesn\\'t follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn\\'t mind hanging with . \\nwhat are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ? \\nwell . . . . \\n1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother . \\n2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis . \\n3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart . \\n4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 . \\n5 . they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic . \\n6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they\\'re friends . \\n7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited . \\n8 . eightly , they\\'re all unhappy or marginally so . \\n9 . there\\'s some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that\\'s built up over the years . \\n10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so . \\n11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song . \\nsince it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a \" british \\'big chill . \\' \" \\nand in some ways it is . \\nboth follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships . \\nbut while \" the big chill \" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , \" peter\\'s friends \" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant . \\nthe friends of peter\\'s were all in the same theatre group back in \\'82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) . \\nafter peter\\'s ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it . \\nnot sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums . \\nof course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule . \\nandrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who\\'s unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner ) . \\nmaggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy . \\nroger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in \" sense and sensibility \" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died . \\nand sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who\\'s married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts . \\nas for peter , things seem okay . . . \\nthe film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i\\'ve done lots of theatre myself ) . \\nand there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) . \\nthe final twist would seem forced an anti-climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did . \\nmaybe it\\'s because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique . \\nthat\\'s really what makes \" peter\\'s friends \" so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone\\'s in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another . \\nit\\'s when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends . \\nnot to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s . \\nthere are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears \" everybody wants to rule the world , \" but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i\\'d put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old \" come on eileen \" ) , but this is the british 80s we\\'re talking about . \\noh well . \\nbut anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing . \\nbranagh\\'s forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical , but at least he\\'s very good with making a less ambiguous film like this . \\nthe writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one-liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , \" no , but we have hollywood \" - punishment like that ) . \\nthe actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand-out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter\\'s mansion . \\na little note should be made about hugh laurie\\'s performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i\\'ve never seen him actually act this dramatically . \\n \" peter\\'s friends \" is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i don\\'t know what kind i\\'ll have ( like most people , i don\\'t look forward to my high school reunion ) . \\nbecause of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that . \\n',\n"," b'even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves . \\ndown periscope stars kelsey \" frasier \" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer\\'s ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy . \\nlike any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn\\'t belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on . \\nthen comes the transparent plotline . \\nfirst grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard . \\nafter the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can\\'t connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone . \\nfinally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise . \\nand he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability . \\nfirst they\\'re singing \" louie louie \" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they\\'re making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off . \\nthe whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) . \\nit\\'s all predictable without any original humor to redeem it . \\nthe jokes are right out of \" mchale\\'s navy \" and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past . \\nthere\\'s one scene where schneider looks through the ship\\'s pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , \" this expired in 1966 ! \" \\ni yelled back at the screen , \" so did these jokes . \" \\ni watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it . \\nmy mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will . \\nthe blame can\\'t really be placed on the stars , though . \\nkelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn\\'t have anything to work with . \\nhis character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had \" welcome aboard \" tatooed on his penis . \\ngrammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about . \\nsame for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she\\'s so gorgeous . \\nas for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he\\'s still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the \" snl \" ship . \\nmy theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( \" okay , it\\'s police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . \" ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster . \\njudging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me . \\nthe only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel\\'s jim ferguson . \\ni guess even jeff craig from \" 60 second preview \" ( who said tank girl \" kicks butt ! \" \\nwithout ever seeing it ) didn\\'t like this . \\n',\n"," b'she was the femme in \" la femme nikita . \" \\nhe was the baldwin in \" backdraft , \" \" sliver , \" and \" fair game \" ( with cindy crawford ) . \\ntogether , anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make \" shattered image \" the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone/stone \" thriller \" \" the specialist . \" \\nthe film poses the question \" what if the life you\\'re living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ? \" \\nit\\'s either about a woman who\\'s haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she\\'s a hired assassin , or it\\'s about a hired assassin who\\'s haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she\\'s honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica . \\nit doesn\\'t much matter and believe me by the time \" shattered image \" runs its painful and pedestrian course you won\\'t care . \\nthese two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it\\'s now * twice * as boring as it might have been . \\nit\\'s not that complicated plots can\\'t be entertaining . \\nof course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style . \\n \" shattered image \" isn\\'t complex , it\\'s just stupid . \\nand boring . \\nparillaud and baldwin , who aren\\'t exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines . \\nlines like : \\n \" you don\\'t beg , you insist . \\ni like that in a woman . \" \\nthat\\'s parillaud\\'s character talking . . . \\nto her cat ! \\nand : \\n \" you\\'re not the reason i couldn\\'t care less about you . \" \\nhuh

\\ntalking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say \" point of no return . \" \\nwe have come to expect this from billy baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first . \\nbut there\\'s nothing to learn . \\nkaren is as interesting as a cereal box , a someone\\'s-out-to-get-me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer . \\nsiouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film\\'s meaningless stock title . \\nbaldwin seems more interested in parillaud\\'s nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her . \\neach time graham greene shows up he gets killed . \\nbarbet schroeder ( \" reversal of fortune \" ) co-produced and should be ashamed of himself . \\nevery now and again it\\'s fun to watch a really bad movie . \\nand every now and again , as \" shattered image \" makes agonizingly clear , it isn\\'t . \\n',\n"," b\"tim robbins and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy . \\nrobbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss . \\nhe goes into depression , and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual 'ghetto' side of every american city . \\nthere , lawernce attempts to steal his car , but to no avail , and is dragged along with robbin's on a trip to arizona . \\nthere , they hold up a store , are mistaken for two other robbers ( just like in my cousin vinny ) and are chased by the police , and the other robbers . \\nof course , there's gags along the way , usually from lawernce . \\nalthough the film is midly funny , and quite watchable , there's something so horribly familiar about it all . \\nthis film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there's lawernce with his wisecracking and heavy profanity , just like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop , and pratically the same idea as midnight run . \\nit's full of all the road movie cliches , and even has a 'comedy' car chase , which just seemed so eighties . \\neven the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin , or chevy chase , eighties comedy . \\nthere also isn't much chemistry between robbins and lawernce . \\nin planes , trains and automobiles , there was real chemistry between steve martin and john candy . \\nin nothing to lose , there is hardly chemistry at all . \\ntowards the end the chemistry seems to work , but for the bulk of the film , there is hardly any , \\nthe director directs the film in a workman like fashion , but gets the jokes across . \\nand although there is no chemistry between the two leads , they give good performances on their own . \\nlawerence gives a good eddie murphy performance , and robbin's is alright aswell . \\nhowever , robbin's performance is nowhere near as good as the characters he played in jacob's ladder , and the player . \\nin fact , if you want to see robbin's do comedy much better than in nothing to lose , i suggest you rent out the hudsucker proxy , where he is much funnier . \\nnothing to lose does have some funny moments in it , however . \\nthe humour isn't particulary sophisticated , but if you enojyed dumb & dumber , you might enjoy this . \\nthe characters in arizona are funny , and there's also a good scene where robbin's asks a shopkeeper which 'threatening approach' was better , lawerences ( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper's ass , and swearing a lot ) , or himselfs , ( which was speaking in a deep , scary voice ) but the gags are predictable , the lack of chemistry infurating , and the ending too far-fetched and 'perfect' \\nnothing to lose then , is robbin's first 'bad' movie ( and hopefully his last ) , and suggests that odereick should twice before making another film . \\nhe nearly ruined carrey's career with ace ventura : when nature calls , let's hope he hasn't ruined robbin's ( or even lawerence's ) with nothing to lose . \\n\",\n"," b\"this movie stinks ! \\nalthough it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances , the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss . \\ni knew i was in for trouble when , during the opening establishment shots , we see a detailed close-up of warrant officer paul brenner's ( john travolta ) military identification card and it is the wrong color . \\nthis might seem like a minor detail , but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow . \\nand what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training . \\nor what about when brenner tells a suspect that , because he is in the military , he doesn't have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision . \\nhow hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ? \\nnow details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through . \\nfor example , at the beginning of the film , paul brenner , an undercover army investigator , gets into a gun and knife battle at his off-post houseboat and winds-up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating . \\nthe local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing . \\nbut instead of arresting him , or at least take him into custody for further questioning , they release him . \\nduh ! \\nultimately , brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general's daughter , a young captain also assigned to the post . \\nwhen brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general's daughter , does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects . \\nno , his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing . \\neventually , brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier . \\ni won't even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army's suppression of this horrendous crime . \\ni will just mention one final flaw . \\nbrenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia . \\nthe rape occurred in west point , which is in new york . \\nhe is under a very tight ( and totally implausible ) 36-hour deadline to solve this case . \\nhe needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point . \\ndoes he phone the doctor ? \\nno , he travels ( via some unexplained very fast transport ) to new york to question the psychiatrist in person , and then he returns to georgia ( again by the miracle transport ) , without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline . \\nyou have been warned , stay away from this one . \\n\",\n"," b\"several days after having seen this movie , i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . \\nthis is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio . \\nthere's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script . \\nthe premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers , the effeminate leslie edwards ( matthew perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest . \\nedwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early-19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries . \\nalong the way , the intrepid explorers encounter bears , bald eagles , aging native american warriors , and a conquistador named hildago ( kevin dunn ) who raves about his beautiful hair . \\nthe explorers' trek takes them through forests , across the snow-capped rocky mountains , and over a waterfall . \\nthis setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs . \\nfarley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily

dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla . \\nfrankly , it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman . \\nalthough guest gets the costumes right , this nearly-inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution . \\nthe special effects , such as they are , are execrable . \\nfor an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they're obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle . \\neven though farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes . \\nwhile some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric . \\nfarley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session . \\n\",\n"," b\"star wars : episode i - the phantom menace review \\na review by jamey hughton stars ) \\nstarring-liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman and jake lloyd director-george lucas rated g \\nwith all the hype that star wars : episode 1- the phantom menace has been receiving , it seems almost impossible to avoid interest in seeing the film . \\nthe movie is easily the most anticipated motion picture ever , with a marketing campaign so strong it has brought colonel sanders , the taco bell chihuahua and pizza hut together . \\ncan george lucas succeed yet again with transporting us back a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away . . . . ? \\nyes . this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch , with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity . \\nbut that doesn't mean it fails to comply on the basis of solid entertainment . \\nthe phantom menace features the most eye-catching , jaw-dropping visual look in cinematic history . \\nthe tremendous action sequences will have you clinging to your arm rest , and the special effects are nothing short of the best ( and most plentiful ) to ever be caught on film . \\nthe vast digitized worlds and sheer imagination that was applied to this project is astounding . \\nthe phantom menace is a delectable feast for the senses , even if it has some disappointing aspects . \\nafter we're treated to the famous prologue in the sky , with john williams' thundering score , we meet qui-gon jonn ( liam neeson ) and young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , a jedi master and his trainee `padawan' . \\nthey are on the ship accommodating the fleet headquarters for the evil trade federation , and have been sent to settle disputes regarding the taxation of trade routes to the planet of naboo . \\noh , but enough about that . \\nthe prime concern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) into the picture . \\nas you already know , this seemingly charming lad is the boy who will soon become darth vader . \\na spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter . \\nthis particular race is the most exciting , energetic , high-octane action sequence that you'll ever see . \\none of the delights of the series is meeting the newest set of strange alien creatures that lucas has devised , and the phantom menace is no exception . \\ni loved sebulba , the rat-like scoundrel whom anakin has to face in the pod race , and boss nass , the leader of the gungans ( who are a neighbouring species to naboo ) . \\none character who has been subject to criticism is jar-jar binks , a member of the gungan race . \\njar-jar speaks like roger rabbit on a hallucinogenic drug , and is there for the sole purpose of supplying comic relief . \\nyes , he is initially annoying , but i can admit to laughing over some of his harmless , goofy antics . \\nthere is some lack of dramatic pull in this star wars entry , but the presentation almost makes you forget the plot and character lapses . \\nthe final light-saber battle , between the jedi's and the horrific ( and terminally underused ) villain darth maul , is spectacular to behold . \\njabba the hutt , yoda , c-3po and r2-d2 have cameo appearances . \\nlucas has not forget how to captivate an audience , even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness . \\none can only wonder what the possible technology will present for the next two installments , episode's i and ii . \\nwhen they arrive , you'll know where to find me . \\n\",\n"," b\"there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do . \\ni delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda . \\nsomething about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob . \\ndeep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test . \\nsure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait . . . excuse \\nme , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion . \\nthere are too-cheesy-to-be-accidental elements , like a sleazy shipping magnate ( anthony heald ) who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology , or a slinky international jewel thief ( famke janssen ) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold . \\nas it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients . \\na terrorist crew , led by squinty-eyed mercenary hanover ( wes studi ) and piloted by squinty-eyed boat captain finnegan ( treat williams ) , shows up to loot the cruise ship ; the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew ; a few survivors make it to the closing credits . \\nand up go the lights . \\nit's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream . \\nhere , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j . o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic . \\nwriter/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously . \\ndeep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes . \\ncase it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda . \\nin deep rising , one of the creature's victims is regurgitated back into view , partially digested and still alive . \\nhe shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable . \\nin anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive . \\nhe looks at another character . . . and \\nwinks . \\nmake no mistake , deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing . \\nit's also gloomy , uninspired and not nearly enough fun . \\ni don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies . \\nyou don't have to show me a fantastically impressive , massive beast with tentacles a-flailing . \\njust show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point . \\n\",\n"," b\"as forgetful as some

that he actually creates flubber . \\nit's amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything . \\nthe whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful . \\nthis is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor . \\nwell , this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded . \\nalong the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber . \\nthankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience . \\nthe flubber is supposed to be flying rubber , but it seems to have a life of its own . \\nthis is there strictly for the kids . \\nthe properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs . \\nalthough amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone . \\nthe poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at , get his fiancee back , finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire , and do all this in the funniest way possible . \\nadmittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original ( the absent minded professor ) . \\nthe whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable . \\nthe basketball players , stereotypically unqualified for the sport , somehow manage to bounce , fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning ? \\nthis just sounds too bad to be true , the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance . \\nas for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie . \\ngiving life to the flubber , which is so poorly executed that it's best forgotten , and prof . brainard's flying robot weebo . \\ngiving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn't for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie . \\nthe life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well , but it wasn't and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good . \\nnow , weebo is a totally different story . \\nit's a robot that prof . brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too . \\nthis is a really original idea , well maybe not , but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie . \\nyes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters . \\nthe film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all . \\nthe acting by robin williams ( prof . \\nbrainard ) seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced . \\nmost of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 . \\npeople when stood up at the altar , don't usually give third chances . \\nor for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards , but what can be expected this is a children's movie . \\nflubber , as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect . \\nwith the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great . \\nit does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end , but it does not wash up to the original . \\nkids should find this movie amusing and fun and they'll probably enjoy the whole movie . \\nas a movie it's just a kids movie and not

contains very few moments of magic . . . or \\nhumor for that matter , drama , suspense , or romance . \\nwell actually , there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled , it never lets you in on whether it\\'s a comedy , a drama , a horror show , or a murder mystery . \\nor maybe it\\'s a romance , eh ? \\nit doesn\\'t really matter , cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting , that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them , or the film as a whole . \\nif only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack , this film might\\'ve had a chance to be more than what it is now . \\nwhich is an unentertaining , crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grab-bag of stupid voice-overs , overdone songs , melodramatic romance , undeveloped story and uneven acting . \\ni only wish that i could make that one hour and forty-five minutes of my life re-appear , but alas , it is lost in the spiritual world of \" interesting ideas gone wildly awry \" . \\nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : this film is based on the novel written by alice hoffman . \\nco-screenwriter akiva goldsman also wrote the screenplay for 1997\\'s batman & robin . \\ndirector griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours . \\n',\n"," b' \" soldier \" , by director paul anderson , is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting . \\nthe best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel\\'s character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision . \\nbrutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it , and the opening scenes tap into it a little . \\nthen it goes nowhere with that idea . \\nthere is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization , and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i\\'ve ever seen . \\nthe whole idea of the inhuman , soldier-type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done , and it\\'s been done much better . \\ni was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story , which wouldn\\'t be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting . \\nbetween the action sequences , it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr . russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes , since his dialog is extremely limited . \\nhis performance in that way isn\\'t all that bad , but certainly is not enough to carry this film . \\nother performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all , and they generally are about as weak as their characters . \\nbut enough of this stuff about plot and character , right ? \\nisn\\'t the most important part of an action film , well , the action ? \\neven in this aspect the film is a disappointment . \\nin mortal kombat ( 1995 ) , director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining . \\nhowever , he fails to repeat that in this film . \\nthe combat scenes , particularly the big one at the end , is incredibly unimaginatve . \\nfighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie , a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize . \\nbut instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with , it goes for the old , shoot-em up , one guy vs . an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s . \\nif the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously , it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film . \\nhowever , it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that , making the film a big disappointment . \\n',\n"," b\"8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery . \\nnicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe . \\nthe movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed . \\nall mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not . \\nwelles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide . \\nalthough the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most . \\nthe snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away . \\n8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller . \\nthe cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage . \\nwhile he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . ) \\nhere , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice . \\nand in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up . \\nonly when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent . \\nhis performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . \\ncatherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves . \\nher character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year . \\nalso fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director . \\nas this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch . \\nunlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives . \\nlacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment . \\nbut director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing . \\nschumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point . \\nalso , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching . \\n8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity . \\nwith a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller . \\nultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . \\nand trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it . \\n\",\n"," b\"wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you . \\nyou can see its plot developing from a mile away . you \\nare lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl looking for a soul mate in boston , as that city is depicted as a mini-wonderland for singles . \\nthis is a star oriented film , and the star who carries the film is erin ( hope davis ) . \\nthat this is a dating film , about singles who for reasons of fate or luck , or whatnot , have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers , is nothing new , this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films . \\nthe fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film . the \\nmain quirk in the plot here , is that hope's pushy mother ( hollan ) visits her in boston , sees her daughter's live-in relationship with a radical protester ( hoffman ) breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school drop-out daughter , who works as a nurse . \\nthis is done without her knowledge . \\nit is cornball sitcom stuff , but , at least , it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director . \\nit is easy to like erin , she is bright , caring , and attractively blonde . \\nit is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with , the financially strapped , ruggedly handsome , intelligent 35-year-old alan ( alan ) , who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist . \\nof course , he comes across as being so good ( though , he does kill some fish in the aquarium ) , that it is hard to believe he's for real , or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for . \\nthe contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as , the subway , at a restaurant , or on the phone . \\nalan's brother answers erin's ad with a few of his pals , as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way , making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her , that the others witness , will win the bet . \\nthis sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told . \\nthat we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are , each one more annoying than the other , culminating in the most obnoxious one of all , that brazilian lover ( jose ) , who is about as charming as a snake-oil salesman , who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil , was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story . \\nanyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line . \\nthe dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation . \\nand , oh , by the way , wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro , it is where greyhound racing takes place . \\n\",\n"," b' \" something is fishy in the state of universal . \" \\nabout ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies . \\nwe\\'ve always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on . \\nto date , the most smoothly done were straightforward \" haircuts \" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim . \\nmost of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane . \\n ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . ) \\nnow we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter . \\n ( well , she\\'s not a widow , and the kid isn\\'t her daughter , but you get the idea . ) \\nthe lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn\\'t given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script . \\nthe child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through . \\nin simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now . \\nthe polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet . \\nthe few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy . \\nsomehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called \" smokers , \" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis . \\nenola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back . \\nwe suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical \" dryland , \" the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola . \\nthe psycho ruler of the smokers , the \" deacon , \" is trying to get her and find his way to dryland . \\nplayed with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , \" deacon \" is the only thing in the movie that\\'s close to amusing . \\nhis performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn\\'t enough there to be funny . \\nthe star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner . \\nhe\\'s playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the \" mariner , \" who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet . \\nvery little is done with this . \\nthe script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps

of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times . \\nit is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam . \\nit is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news . \\nthe love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn\\'t mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped . \\nthe introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray . \\nray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield , new jersey , suburban basement . \\nray sr . ( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business . \\nhis son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil ) . \\nthe title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you \\nshould be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don\\'t make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them . \\ndesperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e . moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a \" sure thing \" at freehold raceway . \\nthe horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough . \\nthere is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray . \\nhe is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid . \\nso when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ? \\nthe director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do . \\nas for ray\\'s gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen . \\nhis buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid . \\nand the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together . \\nthere was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star . \\nbecause of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn . \\n',\n"," b'a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge . \\nat the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise .

soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . . \\nand , ultimately ( didn\\'t we see this one coming ? ) , \\nlove . \\nso far , so mediocre . \\nbut mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge\\'s contextual frame for the romance . \\nit turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven\\'s police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o\\'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status . \\nthis conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture . \\nbut it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand . \\nnot that there is much of a romance to begin with . \\ntry as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters . \\nceline is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . \\nas such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other . \\nwhen celine and robert start to overtly act on their \" feelings , \" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural . \\nbut i am not exactly sure if boyle and company\\'s point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish . \\nboyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting . \\nthe cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling . \\nand then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue . \\nwatching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool . \\ninstead , the film just gives quirky a bad name . \\nmy best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing \" beyond the sea \" at a karaoke bar . \\nafter a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter . \\nthe scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport . \\nalas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end . \\ni applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill . \\na life less ordinary certainly delivers something \" different , \" but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary . \\n \" i can accept failure . \\neveryone fails at something . \\nbut i can\\'t

the first half-hour of \" analyze this \" was very funny . \\nunfortunately , as the running time ticked away , i began to think that the first thirty minutes had , unbeknownst to me , been rewound and were being replayed another two-and-a-half times . \\nthe film has obtained a clever premise , but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen . \\nmiddle-aged psychoanalyst ben sobel\\'s ( billy crystal ) life is finally going very well . \\nalthough he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents , especially his father , who is also a psychiatrist , ben has an easy-going teenage son ( kyle sabihy ) and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend , laura ( lisa kudrow ) . \\nin little but a flash , however , ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro ) , who desperately wants counseling , even though he himself won\\'t even admit to having anxiety attacks . \\nben tries to help paul , mostly so he will get him off his back , but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding , which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death . \\nit seems to ben that no matter what he does , paul vitti will not go away , and the more they become involved , the more ben\\'s potentially happy life gets into danger . \\n \" analyze this \" has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half ) , but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan , ramis , and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time . \\nadmittedly , de niro is very funny here ( and i can\\'t remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them , including a substantial plotline . \\nsince \" analyze this \" bills not one , not two , but three writers , you\\'d think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot . \\none of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters , all of which have next to nothing to do and aren\\'t even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop . \\ncoming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year\\'s best films , \" clockwatchers \" and \" the opposite of sex , \" lisa kudrow\\'s throwaway \" girlfriend \" role is an incredible step down . \\nsure , kudrow\\'s fellow \" friend \" jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in \" office space , \" but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston . \\nkudrow , meanwhile , mostly just stands around , no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place . \\nchazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fares even worse , in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character . \\nfinally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on \" saturday night live \" ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal\\'s patients and then completely disappears . \\ntoo bad , considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal . \\nonce \" analyze this \" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow\\'s laura standing alone at the altar once again , i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone , and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most , ben . \\nafterwards , the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul , became a real laugh-free dead-zone , losing its last remaining comic punches . \\n \" analyze this \" proves that talent can certainly help any film out , but when the written material isn\\'t

business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman . \\nstone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the

presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top . \\nthese guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges . \\nmore than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street . \\nthe only possible solution i can muster is its release date . \\nand not just the timeliness of the \" greed is good \" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies . \\nin my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes . \\nmaybe stone\\'s after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace . \\nboiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone\\'s piece of crap . \\nthey both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room\\'s is much more subtle and touching . \\nand they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street . \\nboiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn\\'t shove it in our faces . \\nboiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash . \\nas i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn\\'t been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires ! \\nin our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it \" all \" . \\nand seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it \" all \" the easy way . \\nhe\\'s a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him . \\nben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko . \\nhis job is to influence trainee\\'s into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood . \\nit\\'s ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they\\'re told to dish out to prospective buyers . \\naffleck\\'s character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin\\'s similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor\\'s performance . \\naffleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge . \\nwhen alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own . \\nby comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading . \\nthe brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game . \\nrap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters . \\nthey aren\\'t above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes . \\nwe drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be . \\nas in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness . \\ni know this story . \\nwe all do . \\nbut it can work if it\\'s told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \\\\ director ben younger tells it . \\nas a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn . \\nhis style is sitcom bland . \\nbut his writing isn\\'t . \\nyounger\\'s script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet . \\ndespite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script . \\nthe brokers \\\\ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock . \\nthese moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn\\'t aware that he is one . \\nwith the exception of affleck\\'s brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional . \\nribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth . \\nhe conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren\\'t going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he\\'s ferociously cut throat . \\nthe jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it\\'s just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) . \\nboiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys . \\nthose ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth\\'s friend and his mentor . \\ndiesl shines in his minor role . \\nthis week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner . \\nin that

\\nunfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for . \\nordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of \" fallen angels \" , this is not so . \\nevery shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at . \\nwong does really interesting things with the camera , but he doesn\\'t allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal \" knock off \" ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe . \\nugh . ) \\nthe movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives . \\ni can\\'t say much more than that as i didn\\'t really know what was going on most of the time . \\nin fact , it wasn\\'t until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character . \\nthe constantly moving camera doesn\\'t really allow for the audience to associate with any one character . \\nwe\\'re always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters . \\n \" fallen angels \" is a refreshing change-of-pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level . \\nin fact , i\\'d go so far as to say that \" fallen angels \" is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i\\'ve ever seen . \\nsure , there\\'s directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating . \\nbut if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images . \\nthere were far too many instances during \" fallen angels \" in which i asked myself , \" now who are these people again ? \\nis this that first couple or the second couple ? \" \\nit was impossible to keep track . \\nperhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with \" name cards \" , as in scorsese\\'s \" mean streets \" . \\nthat\\'s really besides the point , though . \\nwong kar-wei has proven himself , through very few films , that\\'s he\\'s a movie-maker to watch . \\nlet\\'s just hope that he hones

shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal . \\none of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories , but it\\'s only followed up on in a token fashion . \\nfor his trouble , johnny gets chased by the yakuza , who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high-tech thrillers . \\nwhat\\'s funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan , there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics , but of course there\\'s no room in this movie for

gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor , sugar hill and american me come to mind -- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped . \\nbut that\\'s another essay . ) \\nanyway , johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark . \\nwhy newark ? \\nmaybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that\\'s why . \\nthere , he meets an assortment of odd characters ( ice-t , dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos ) . \\nthe script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture . \\nit turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny\\'s head could save a lot of people , but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn\\'t kill him . \\nhandled right , this could have been absorbing , but the

\\nmortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn\\'t meaty enough to show all his talent . \\nwhich leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is

\\nthe screenplay is o . k , but there\\'s some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched . \\nthe characters

by david wilcock ? 1998 \\n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \\n',\n"," b'in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us . \\npresident john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson\\'s dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in \" thirteen days . \" \\none of the highlights to come out of made-for-tv movies was a 1974 entry called \" missiles of october \" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown . \\nthat teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962 . \\nnow , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller \" no way out \" ) to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time in america\\'s and the world\\'s history . \\ntaken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p . o\\'donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war . \\nas o\\'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems . \\nmeanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment . \\nsuddenly , ken\\'s routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat . \\nwhere \" thirteen days \" differs most from \" missiles of october \" is , as expected , in the scope of the project . \\nthere is a big difference , budget-wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen . \\nit shows as the makers of \" thirteen days \" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation . \\nthe cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner . \\ncostner\\'s o\\'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family . \\nthis puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america\\'s preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know . \\nkenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more . \\nthe meat of \" thirteen days \" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though . \\nthis is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels . \\nthe story does not just cover the face-off between the world\\'s two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia . \\nthe disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro . \\nthe missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army/navy/air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america\\'s dignity and world leadership intact . \\nwhile the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba . \\nthis is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action . \\nwhen the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable . \\nthe most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane . \\nthis is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles . \\nthe ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players . \\ngreenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent . \\ninstead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options . \\nkennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president . \\ncostner , as ken o\\'donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor . \\ncostner plays o\\'donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech . \\nthe rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy . \\nthe rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too . \\nstanding out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly . \\nthe filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect . \\ndylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara . \\nkevin conway gives his general lemay the right \" bomb them to hell \" attitude . \\nalso notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who , with his wingman , takes on the dangerous mission of a low-level photo recon into the heart of cuba , bravely challenging kenny o\\'donnell\\'s admonition , \" don\\' get shot . \" \\ntech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing . \\nit\\'s an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event . \\nsolid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys . \\nthere is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right . \\nthe special f/x of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging . \\nthe cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader . \\nhelmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year . \\ni give \" thirteen days \" an a- . \\n',\n"," b\"this film is extraordinarily horrendous and i'm not going to waste any more words on it . \\n\",\n"," b'as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable . \\nwith a total of 4 decent films , it\\'s not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing . \\nwith that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on \" the 13th warrior \" will be . \\nthe film is based on the michael crichton \" eaters of the dead \" , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king . \\nafter tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog . \\nso , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen . \\nso far it sounds interesting right ? \\nnot when all of this takes place in 15 minutes . \\nafter that , they basically run around killing . \\nthat alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it . \\nobviously that\\'s not the case here . \\neven if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed . \\nsince all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work . \\ncan\\'t the camera men sit still ? \\ni\\'d like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well . \\nthe film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you\\'re eating . \\nwith corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there\\'s basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs . \\nthat\\'s the only thing that honestly caught my interest . \\nwhen i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ? \\nwell now i know . \\ncrichton\\'s greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement . \\nwhat\\'s there to argue about anyway ? \\nthe film couldn\\'t be saved , no matter how much they spent or casted . \\nseeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn\\'t be surprised to see \" the 13th warrior \" become a hit . \\nplease do me a favor and save your money at all costs , or else you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself . \\n',\n"," b'you don\\'t look at a ren ? magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning . \\nyou likewise don\\'t look at one for 88 minutes straight . \\nsurrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting . \\nthat was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue . \\nit\\'s not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word . \\nthough the film is distinctive , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes , and as it progressed , watching became a chore . \\nthe only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary ed wood , the man behind such \" classics \" as plan 9 >from outer space and night of the ghouls . \\nthe joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they\\'re good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits . \\ni woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it\\'s really bad . \\nit stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money . \\nour thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual . \\nhe falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone . \\nfor whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time , why didn\\'t he just go steal some more ? ) . \\nhe comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don\\'t have what he is looking for . \\ni don\\'t think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short . \\nthe subject and the style seem to have been made for it . \\nunfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome . \\nit grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary . \\nit might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is . \\ni woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me . \\nunlike most ed wood films , this one tries to be funny and fails , instead of the other way around . \\nthere\\'s nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so \" good \" at making unintentional comedies

17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only . \\ncoincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox\\'s animated film anastasia was released . \\nyou know disney , they can\\'t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old \" masterpiece \" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . \\nlet no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . \\nthey still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . \\nbelieve it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time . \\nit took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom\\'s friends for a couple weeks . \\nthey had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times . \\nby the time i got back home , i promised myself i\\'d never see the movie . \\nbut promises are made to be broken , especially when you\\'re looking at a 17-day , limited engagement . \\ndamn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games . \\nthe little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it\\'s disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song . \\nit also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times . \\ni never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . . \\nthe heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase . \\nshe skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans . \\nshe\\'s also dealing with feelings she hasn\\'t had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn\\'t use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) . \\nher father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the \" savage \" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating . \\nwhat\\'s a king to do , though ? \\nthe girl\\'s in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn\\'t deter her . \\nariel saves the prince\\'s life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him . \\nshe makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) . \\nyou know she\\'s evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history . \\nshe also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl\\'s corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out . \\nshe\\'ll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . \\nand if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she\\'ll fall asleep forever . \\nit\\'s a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . \\nit ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the \\'50s . \\nall the elements are there -- memorable songs like \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl , \" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . \\nthe little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left . \\nserving america for more than 1/25th of a century ! \\n',\n"," b'certainly no one would rent ed wood\\'s glen or glenda ? \\nexpecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn\\'t know was possible . \\nin fact , wood\\'s infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison . \\nwatching glen or glenda ? \\ni found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious . \\nthe movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend\\'s clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) \" not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time . \" \\nthe camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone\\'s ear or nose . \\nwood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , \" yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles . \" \\nfinally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , \" people . \\n . \\n . \\nall with their own thoughts . \\n . \\n . \\ntheir own ideas . \\n . \\n . \\n . \" \\nwhile lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead . \\nhad wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ? \\nprobably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch . \\nunfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script . \\n \" pull the string ! \\npull the string ! \" \\nannounces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears . \\nthere is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns , this time warning us , \" beware . \\n . \\n . \\nbeware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door ! \\n . \\n . \\n . \\nit eats little boys . \\n . \\n . \\nand puppy dogs\\' tails . \\n . \\n . \\nand big fat snails ! \" \\na bizarre nightmare sequence , which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid , ensues , during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree-in the living room . \\nsomeone who is apparently intended to be the sinister \" green dragon \" ( but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series ) appears to be orchestrating all this , though the film is far from clear on this point ( to put it kindly ) . \\nnear the end of this scene-and here i must confess that wood lost me completely-is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music . \\nafter this scene ends ( not a moment too soon ) , glen or glenda ? \\nreturns to its documentary style , but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone . \\nthe film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism , but at that point it didn\\'t matter much what happened . \\nas soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over , glen or glenda ? \\nhad pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen . \\ni honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could , it still might not match glen or glenda ? \\nfor sheer cinematic disaster . \\ni am giving this movie an f , but i\\'m not sure that quite does it justice . \\n',\n"," b'true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it . \\neven the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . \\nso it\\'s not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get \" the apostle \" onto the big-screen . \\nas a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money . \\nhe also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss \" sonny \" dewey . \\nfew filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it\\'s testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . \\nand , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion . \\nsonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . \\nhe spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . \\nunlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film\\'s purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church . \\nduvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . \\none of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . \\nfaced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . \\nat his son\\'s baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife\\'s lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . \\nnot knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . \\nhe throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . \\nin the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . \\nafter befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town\\'s ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . \\nre-christening himself as \" the apostle e . f . , \" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other\\'s lives . \\nbut , always , sonny\\'s past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . \\nduvall has made his intentions in making \" the apostle \" clear . \\nin a recent article in \" newsweek , \" he wrote : \" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . . \\nbut what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . \" \\nthe strength of duvall\\'s convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - \" the apostle \" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he\\'s being sincere with the subject matter . \\nafter fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . \\nhis sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . \\n \" i\\'ve always called you jesus and you\\'ve always called me sonny , \" he says . \\nwhen neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny\\'s mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there\\'s no sense trying to interrupt him . \\nthe main theme to emerge from \" the apostle \" is the fact that good can come from any situation . \\nsonny\\'s act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . \\nhowever , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . \\nin his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . \\nand , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . \\nit is that strength in sonny\\'s character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws . \\nweak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves . \\nwatching duvall on-screen , it\\'s not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting . \\nas sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year . \\nbecause he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human . \\nas a director , duvall feels that less is more . \\nhis camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion . \\nthere are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close-ups . \\nduvall knew that the power of the film\\'s characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn\\'t need to be artificially enhanced . \\nin this way , \" the apostle \" almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality . \\n',\n"," b'seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] \\nmodern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . \\nthe biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . \\n \" your friends and neighbors \" takes a different approach as it\\'s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . \\none of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute\\'s basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . \\nfirstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . \\neverything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . \\nbut to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . \\nlabute\\'s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what\\'s specifically impressive is the fact the characters\\' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . \\nfor the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . \\nanother interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . \\nwe\\'re always able to tell where the characters are ( someone\\'s home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . \\nthe film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . \\nno one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . \\nwe\\'re simply dropped in on the characters\\' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . \\nthe characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they\\'re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . \\nfirst there\\'s barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don\\'t know what they\\'re problem is . \\nbarry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn\\'t have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . \\nmary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn\\'t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . \\nlabute\\'s script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . \\nobviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors\\' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . \\nanother couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . \\ntheir sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . \\nif only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . \\nit\\'s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? \\nwhat did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? \\nlabute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it\\'s fascinating . \\ntwo other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . \\ncary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word \" bastard . \" \\nsomehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . \\nhe\\'s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he\\'s secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . \\npatric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . \\ncheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . \\nshe works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . \\nshe\\'s a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . \\ni will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others\\' action , as that\\'s the hook of the film . \\nthe first two acts begin to set up the characters and each\\'s scenarios , but it\\'s often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . \\nthe result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . \\nfor a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character\\'s guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . \\none of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . \\nsince the characters only interact with each other there isn\\'t much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . \\nare we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? \\ni don\\'t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . \\noften times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . \\nbut what this film does have that the others don\\'t is repercussions in the end . \\nalthough the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren\\'t immortal . \\nin what way \" your friends and neighbors \" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . \\nit definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . \\nstill , it\\'s an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective . \\n',\n"," b'the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience . \\nbeing a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take . \\nthus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater

write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn\\'t even come to a fraction of it . \\ni shouldn\\'t expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their

remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the \" that\\'ll do , pig . \\nthat\\'ll do . \" \\nnow throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn\\'t approve of the script ) . \\n ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget ) . \\nout . \\ne . g . \\ndaily comes in with noticable results . \\n ( c ) george miller , the director , is more well-known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment , not

the city a fairy-tale look , george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world\\'s great cities , and yes , it _is_ impressive . \\nbut this too is over-used , repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions . \\nand , for the most part , babe _remains in the hotel_ . \\n ( ii ) given the limitations of cromwell , the human element is taken over

prestigious benefit dinner ! ) \\ni was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes , but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in . \\ni am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film , the violence , the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge , head submerged underwater . \\neven the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it , as the brothers grimm have demonstrated . \\nno . . . my problem is with the story , or lack thereof . \\n_babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm , but once in the city , that story is forgotten . \\nbeing a good-natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice , but , other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull , what did babe actually _do_ ? \\nwithout giving the ending away , the farm is saved from a left-field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig . \\nspeaking of \" pig \" , or , \" pig-pig-pig-pig-pig ! \" . \\nthe word \" pig \" is so overused , had they changed it to an expletive , and had the pig be al pacino , i could have been watching _scarface_ . \\nthis is screenwriting ? \\nfurther , i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups . \\nhad it been a cartoon , and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd , maybe my reaction would have been softened . \\nbut

be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative . \\ni just wish he hadn\\'t brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub . \\nsean penn gives a great performance , and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters . \\nthe best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly what the blankety-blank is going on . \\ntoo bad it\\'s not fun to watch when it\\'s happening to us . . . while \\nwe sit through this mess of a film . \\nu-turn is not a bad film if you\\'re a fan of technique . \\nit\\'s the oliver stone you\\'ve always known . \\nrobert richardson is his usual cinematographer , and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures . \\nbut pictures of what ? \\ni think i\\'d rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film . \\nplot twists are one thing , repetition is almost unforgivable , and this is dang near as unforgivable as any movie i\\'ve seen in the past five years . \\noliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at . \\nyou\\'ve been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie , and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on . \\nyour scripts are certainly respectable , your budgets are up there on the screen , and your actors don\\'t dog it . \\nand i know that , maybe , with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun . \\nthat\\'s fine . \\nbut don\\'t do that with a movie with the potential of this one . \\ndo some police academy sequel ( imagine that . ) \\ndo a big comedy , like a remake of it\\'s a mad , mad , mad , mad world . \\nbut do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as \" an oliver stone movie , \" and not question why it stinks

splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film , it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere . \\nbut , it wasn't meant to be , which became obvious following highlander ii . \\nin this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality . \\nvery often such films were science fiction , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert . \\nwhether it was because of real lack of talent , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the end result was almost always horrible . \\nthe same can be said for fortress , 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond . \\nthe movie is set in 2018 . \\nfor some undisclosed reason , usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child . \\njake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border . \\nsentenced to 31 years in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privately owned correctional facility , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed . \\nalthough equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates' lives and make any escape impossible , prison authorities often use violence . \\njake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape . \\nsuch escape should become necessity , because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen . \\nafter rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity . \\nthe reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich ? s and situations that are painfully predictable . \\nby the time brennick begins his escape from fortress , those situations not only begin to look predictable , but utterly implausible too . \\nof course , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society . \\nthe initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters , played by not too interested or talented actors . \\nlori laughlin , although physically attractive , shows the acting ability of sequoia . \\nkurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired , capable of solid , yet forgettable performance . \\nlambert's performance is also good , but even the bigger talent couldn't help this film , destined to end in oblivion . \\n\",\n"," b' \" spawn \" may be somewhat of an older film . \\nin fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn\\'t seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it ) . \\nbut i managed to catch it before it made it\\'s way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and , god forbid , video cassette purchasing . \\nit wasn\\'t the worst film of year by any means . \\nit isn\\'t even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year . \\nbut it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten , which , in simpler terms , means it comes in at number 6 on my \" worst of 1997 \" list . \\nthe only reason it doesn\\'t come in lower is thanks to the special effects , which might actually have been some of the best of the year . \\nperformances , however , were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy . \\nin fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness ! \\neven the editing seemed to boast a campy quality . \\ni don\\'t know how to explain that one ; it wasn\\'t exactly choppy , but something about it seemed . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , annoyingly unprofessional . \\njohn leguizamo almost makes it as clown , but not quite . \\nhe is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional . \\nbut the main problem i found with \" spawn \" , as with most films that wind up on my \" worst of \" lists , is that it was just plain boring . \\ni wouldn\\'t even say there was a climax to the film . \\nsure , it had the big battle scene at the end , but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion . \\nnever too soon , the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way . \\neven though it\\'s one of the shorter movies i\\'ve seen this year , it\\'s one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again . \\nlike i said , the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride , no matter how small . \\ni was impressed with the opening sequence , so long as i didn\\'t allow the melodramatic voice-over and lobotomizing editing to get to me . \\nand batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn\\'s outfit created . \\nbut even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes , which looked quite a bit like a modern video game . \\nwho knows if \" spawn : the video game \" wasn\\'t part of the plan from the beginning ? \\nkeeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable , and in a very small amount , makes up for the cheeziness of it all . \\nbut none of this movie\\'s saving graces can it make it something i\\'d recommend seeing , no matter what the price of admission . \\nthis movie is definitely not for young children , which shouldn\\'t really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers , if anyone , would likely find it appealing . \\nif you really want to catch a movie , there are many better ones out there , no matter what your tastes might be ! \\ntrust me ! \\n \" spawn \" has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers ! \\n',\n"," b'paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i\\'d consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who\\'s managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils . \\nstarship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that\\'s nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage . \\nit\\'s not a completely successful film , but as a failure it\\'s certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one . \\nmy favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven\\'t yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) . \\ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that\\'s as touching as schwarzenegger\\'s in t2 . \\nthat movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics . \\nits violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience . \\nthere\\'s a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him . \\nhe tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim\\'s every fearful tic . \\nit\\'s a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir . \\nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won\\'t shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on . \\nbut why ? \\nhis character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who\\'s always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster . \\nthe kind who just won\\'t die . \\nhollow man\\'s protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who\\'s saddled with the film\\'s worst lines ( \" i\\'ve lost cohesion again ! \" ) . \\nthey\\'re a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush\\'s republican national convention speech ( i . e . \\nbush referring to clinton ; \" ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ? \\nto what end ? \" -- \\nthis actually got applause ! \\nsuddenly warren beatty doesn\\'t look so absurd ) . \\nthe rest of the film\\'s characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood\\'s new character developing technique ? \\nahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ? \\nas the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation\\'s ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) . \\nthey\\'ve performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film\\'s 1950\\'s late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself . \\ncaine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead . \\nour mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it\\'s hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? ) \\nbegins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger . \\nit grows abundantly clear with each new release that it\\'s verhoeven\\'s films that have become hollow . \\nlike the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than \" audiences will pay for anything these days \" . \\nit\\'s an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride . \\nverhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care . \\nthe previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick . \\nhow can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ? \\na couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability . \\nhollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot . \\nbut oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway . \\nverhoeven delivers the sleazy \" goods \" , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable . \\nthe director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background . \\nit\\'s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn\\'t exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well . \\nit\\'s funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman\\'s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand . \\nmost vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks . \\nin fact it\\'s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat . \\nas in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked . \\nthe film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy . \\nit happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses . \\n \" are you looking at me ? \" , she queries , obviously haunted . \\nit\\'s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) . \\nthose special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer . \\nand they\\'re the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental . \\nyou\\'ve been warned . \\nbut you probably won\\'t listen , will you ? \\ntis\\' a pity ? ? ? \\n',\n"," b' \" from the director of \" the nightmare before christmas \" it said in the previews , which i\\'m guessing was said to get people to go see the movie , obviously it hasn\\'t worked since the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million . \\nto each it\\'s own however , since \" monkey bone \" is not only a bad movie all together , but technically well-made . \\na tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects . \\nstu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena \" monkey bone \" a crude comic strip , that everyone wants to merchandise , they go to great links to get it as well , including dollars that let out fart powder . \\nwhen stu and his girlfriend , julie ( bridget fonda ) are in a freak car accident ( you\\'ll see ) stu goes into a coma , and while in his coma stu travels to i\\'m guessing dark town , where all the characters in dreams come to life . \\npeople are stuck in this town , with their nightmares roaming around them . \\nwhen stu spots monkey bone ( whom he really can\\'t stand ) he tries to keep him under control . \\nmaking a new friend kitty ( rose mcgowan ) he learns that if he gets an exit pass from death , he can go back up and live his life . \\nwhen monkey bone and stu steal a pass , monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu\\'s body . \\nnow monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder , so everyone has nightmares . . . or \\nsomething like that . \\nrather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) \" monkey bone \" had potential in the script and even the story . \\nwhat is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes , and lack of character development . \\nfor instance we really don\\'t get to know who stu or julie are , so why should we even care ? \\nkitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her , but we are not given a chance to know her . \\nthe cast is decent however , brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley , but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body . \\nbridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt , her performance is bad and she seems miscast . \\ndave foley isn\\'t given enough to do , as well as \" will & grace\\'s \" megan mullally who can be funny . \\nthe standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself , he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust . \\nthe special effects of \" monkey bone \" is what might really bring in some curious viewers , these special effects are highly effective , and nice to look at with the eyes . \\nsome of them are believable and some unbelievable . . . for \\nmonkey bone he seems to be like stuart little , you really don\\'t realize that he is animated . . . but \\non occasion it sneaks up on you . \\nthe direction by henry selick is good , but at times he doesn\\'t know what kind of film he wants to make , and the ending climax falls off the cliff . \\nit\\'s too bad really , \" monkey bone \" could have been a real good movie , but with it\\'s heavily done hack job , and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role . \\nfor those curious however , it might be worth the rental , but other than that avoid this one . \\n',\n"," b\"vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico . \\nthe house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out . \\nwhile the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence . \\nthat is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line . \\nbut it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene . \\nthen there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that . \\nthe plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end . \\nand that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery . \\nthis could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it . \\nwhat carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires . \\nthere is a lot of fighting and lots of gore . \\nanything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans . \\nthis has not always been carpenter's style . \\nhis 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question . \\njack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows . \\nin the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is . \\nnow crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) . \\nto make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust . \\nmeanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico . \\nif this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is . \\nthe same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin . \\nbut carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them . \\njust about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown . \\nfundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ? \\nthe answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog . \\nnow if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona . \\nwoods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well . \\nbut carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing . \\nwhile his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target . \\nwoods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero . \\nthat is not his style and it just does not work very well . \\nthere are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses . \\nin one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor . \\none female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair . \\nas the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down . \\none also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret . \\nthese vampires do not maintain a low profile . \\nthere are arguably logical flaws in the film . \\nthere is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires . \\nit would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight . \\ni suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out . \\nwhile i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\nperhaps i will read the book . \\n\",\n"," b'i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . \\nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid who\\'s had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he\\'s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \\nprofessor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \\nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \\na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will\\'s therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \\nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau\\'s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \\nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \\nwhat makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will\\'s life . \\nthe script\\'s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \\nlambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we\\'re not sure if we like what he has to say . \\nand sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \\nwill\\'s reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters\\' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \\nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \\nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \\n \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \\nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \\nwill\\'s relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the \\'f\\' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will\\'s character . \\nadd all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven\\'t given this film four stars . \\nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \\nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \\nstill , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of \\'97 films . \\n',\n"," b\"notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica . \\nthe first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers . \\nif

kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan \\nexotica is a film that grows on retrospection . \\nexotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film . \\nall of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account . \\nthe director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction . \\nexotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique . \\nat the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features . \\nthe out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films . \\nsimilarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots . \\non a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at . \\nbut perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life . \\nexotica is very much worth seeing . \\nit opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) . \\nin canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release . \\napart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie . \\nthe spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen . \\nbut if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica . \\nanalysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ) \\nwhat is behind the complex plot in exotica ? \\nfirst , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means . \\nthe lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . . \\nthen we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . . \\nin that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen . \\nexotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner . \\nexotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) . \\nin exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows . \\nsecond , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters . \\nthe strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter . \\nthe niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter . \\nthe pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter . \\na chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at

happened to him as it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) . \\nhis love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave . \\nhe returned to find her dead and was heart-broken . \\nso he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground . \\ndon't get the wrong idea , it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting , but good is the last thing this film is . \\nmaybe if it were an hour less , it may have been tolerable , but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle . \\nthe only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography . \\nother than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film . \\n , \\n\",\n"," b'okay , bear with me y\\'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest : \\nwhat the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ? \\nwhew . okay . \\ncause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe . \\neven i know that you need more footage than * that * . \\nand that wasn\\'t the only thing getting on my nerves . \\nthe cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie . \\nat first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace . \\nit is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * doesn\\'t * die . \\na ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i\\'m willing to accept it because i\\'m willing to accept that this is how amanda\\'s life is changed , how her powers are received . \\nlater on , the movie can\\'t seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom . \\nand this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they weren\\'t just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary . \\nthe plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc . ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good . \\nsome places the plot just doesn\\'t make sense , sometimes it\\'s way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice . \\ncan\\'t beat that ) . \\nall in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected . \\nnot romantic at all , and only funny in some places . \\nso , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ? \\nor the fairy godfather ? \\nshe can * float * now too ? \\nand all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ? \\ntom all of a sudden just accepts amanda\\'s \" witchcraft \" in the end ? \\nwould people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac\\'s video ? \\nwhat the hell is up with that damn crab ? \\nit is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome . \\nthe film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables . \\nthe humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) . \\ngellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming \" cruel intentions \" ) than this sorry excuse for a character . \\nit\\'s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible . \\nthe supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in \" you\\'ve got mail \" ( see footnotes ) . \\nand , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there\\'s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places . \\nthis sort of got on the nerves after a while , too . \\n \" simply irresistible \" is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and generally disappointing because it can\\'t draw the line between romance and protracted sap , between humor and tired slapstick . \\nand how could i refrain from making a pun ? \\n . \\n . \\n . \\n \" simply irresistible \" is all too easy to resist . \\n ( first viewing , 2/6/99 ) \\n * did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to \" you\\'ve got mail \" ( or \" the shop around the corner \" ) ? \\nbusiness rivals fall in love . \\nfemale counterpart\\'s business is in danger of being shut down . \\nfemale as mother- like figure guiding her . \\nthe annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends . \\n * i _really_ like sarah michelle gellar\\'s wardrobe . \\n',\n"," b'it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable . \\nthe academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed . \\nit also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner . \\nwhat i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 . \\nwhat drags braveheart down is its screenplay . \\nit abounds with high production values : john toll\\'s award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick\\'s 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names . \\nbut this does not save a misguided script . \\nthe film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer\\'s only response to his \" heroism \" is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him . \\nbut wallace\\'s actions paint a different story . \\nhe speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance . \\nthough one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king . \\nwallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance . \\nafter kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england . \\nthis is evident of a \" spartacus complex \" , and this example applies both historically and cinematically . \\nthe historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay . \\nit is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film . \\nhorner\\'s score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help . \\ngibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him . \\nthis drags down any emotional connection to the film\\'s plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time . \\n',\n"," b\"as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients . \\nhe is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony . \\nand , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer . \\nin the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal . \\nhis unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) . \\nhe is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division . \\nlomax is soon given the case of his life . \\nhe must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide . \\nthe draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell . \\nhe works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) . \\nbut what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story . \\nit begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed . \\nbut milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm . \\nquite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago . \\nfreaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed . \\nthe movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts . \\nthe first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer . \\nthe second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax . \\nunfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere . \\ngranted , the film is very handsome-looking . \\nyou'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino . \\nyou'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties . \\nyou'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away . \\nthis was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub-plot . \\nas with all thing's involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst . \\nin the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background . \\nhis path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored . \\nhis actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not fully known . \\npacino's comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie . \\nthere is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited . \\nthe focus seemed inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap . \\nthis movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time . \\nhowever , while the devil's advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it makes very little impression at all . \\n\",\n"," b'this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff\\'s play \" hospitality suite . \\'\\'its \\nabout three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation . \\nhe is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention . \\n \" the big kahuna \" revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department . \\nthese three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite . \\nthe three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life . \\nthe outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why . \\nwhat comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living . \\nthese are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . \\ntheir dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . \\nfollowing in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . \\nin this case , it is landing the big kahuna . \\nthey each are trying to see why he\\'s on top and why they are chasing after him . \\nwhat makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . \\nand how after each one\\'s psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each . \\nthe goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen . \\nlarry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life . \\nbob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ . \\nhis vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in . \\nbob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion . \\nto just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible . \\nwhen asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can\\'t even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him . \\nthe contrast in their personalities is stark . \\nlarry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale . \\nhe comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman . \\nhe criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out . \\nhe tells him to go on a vacation . \\nget a woman . \\nwhile phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long . \\nhe now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in . \\nhe has always been a charmer , shaking everyone\\'s hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale . \\nlarry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale . \\nin contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him . \\nthis is his first time for him on the road . \\nwhen dick fuller doesn\\'t arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering . \\nwhen told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account . \\nbut when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man\\'s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus . \\nbob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend . \\nlarry and phil can\\'t fathom how bob didn\\'t make a sales pitch . \\nbut they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller\\'s attention about their company\\'s product as they sent him off to meet fuller , and will await his return in the hotel room . \\nthese two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass . \\nthe irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room , as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives . \\nthese three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . \\nthe only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience . \\nbut the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see . \\n',\n"," b\"plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony . \\nnaturally , this got me worried . \\nwould jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ? \\nif it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in . \\nif it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel . \\nunfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm . \\ncarlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman . \\nas the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else . \\nthe film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler . ) \\nhot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead . \\nplunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose . \\nalthough undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there's very little merit contained in the film . \\ncarlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped . \\nit appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script . \\nthe five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story . \\nalso , major events , such as mr . cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened . \\nthe story is a bit of a mess , frankly . \\nthe performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest . \\nher irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on . \\nshe looks nice , though . \\nmore interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester , and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character , he hams it up well . \\nken stott is suitably evil as chance , but again he is nothing but a flat character . \\ni didn't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived . \\nalthough a disappointment in writing , and a minor success in acting , the film certainly look lavish , with good costumes , and wonderful sets . \\nbut production design alone can't save a movie , especially a movie as bad as this mess . \\njake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty , with 'f * ck this' and 'stand and f * cking deliver' splattered all over the place . \\nthe mtv editing and direction are flash enough , but in the end decidedly empty . \\nplunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment . \\nalthough somewhat enjoyable during parts , it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just images on a reel . \\nthere's no thought , no development , no plot , just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen-xers . \\nalthough it's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it's execution is awful , and would more likely bore than excite . \\nsloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless , it's hard to recommend plunkett & macleane as a movie , but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video . \\ngive it a miss . \\n\",\n"," b'the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , \" i think we need a bigger bat cave , \" or something to that note . \\nthat\\'s exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much . \\ncut batgirl out . \\ncut one of the villains . \\nit\\'s too much to handle in one dosage . \\nit\\'s so much that characters get left behind . \\npoor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form . \\nand elle deserves better . \\nthis is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher . \\nit\\'s also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) . \\nthe series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) . \\nthis one\\'s not anti-climactic - i knew it was gonna suck . \\nit\\'s up to joel to make it fun though . \\n \" batman forever \" was fun . \\nthis is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters . \\ni mean , this one bit . \\ni\\'m gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who\\'s wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days . \\nhe\\'s a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? \\njoker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body . \\nbatman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they\\'re growing apart . \\nmeanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he\\'s used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had . \\nshe emerges from her chemicals ( don\\'t ask \\'cause i can\\'t tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who\\'s poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people . \\nshe starts to tear away at the dynamic duo . \\nmeanwhile , alfred\\'s dying of the same disease mr . freeze\\'s wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl . \\nmeanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman\\'s alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing . \\nend of her for all we know . \\nmr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don\\'t ask ! ! ! ) . \\nthe trio must team together \" as family \" to beat them . \\nthere ya go . \\nnot the whole story but no big context clues . \\ntoo much , right ? \\nright ! \\nthe films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels . \\nhowever , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one . \\nhe gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that\\'s it . \\nmaybe some stunts . \\nfor all this , i can\\'t even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! \\nand when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say . \\ni think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode . \\ngeorge is in between them . \\nhe\\'s not quintessential , he\\'s not horrible , he\\'s good . \\nbut i\\'m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they\\'ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we\\'ll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) . \\nthe villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher . \\nlast time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey . \\nthis time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze . \\nwe feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? \\narnold isn\\'t very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points . \\nwhen he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber . \\nwow . \\nbut uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness . \\nit\\'s like she\\'s almost parodying herself in \" pulp fiction \" at points . \\nshe\\'s incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better . \\nas for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in \" batman forever , \" although i think his work in these is too hokey when he\\'s best at quieter parts in \" scent of a woman \" or just plain cool parts in \" fried green tomotoes . \" \\nalicia - i love the girl but she\\'s not particularly good in this film . \\nshe can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in \" clueless , \" but her lines kinda sound weird . \\nand it isn\\'t the mushy-mouth this time . \\nbut in all fairness , she has virtually no part . \\njoel gets around to her occasionally and when she\\'s on , she does stupid stuff . . . although \\ni know i\\'m not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . . \\nand poor elle . \\npoor , poor elle . \\ni love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw \" sirens \" ) . \\nbut she has no part ! ! ! \\nit seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product . \\nthere are no \" couch \" scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) . \\nnow listen to me on this one - in every \" batman \" flick , there\\'s a couch scene . \\nin the original , it was with vicki . \\nin \" returns , \" it was a good make-out scene with selena . \\nand in the last one , it was a chat with nicole . \\nthis one , it\\'s nothing . \\nand batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she\\'s suddenly \" part of the family . \" \\nfortunately , we get a lot of alfred . \\nhe\\'s the always reliable butler , in case you didn\\'t know , who has been with bruce all his life . \\nhe\\'s a god . \\nhe\\'s a father figure . \\nhe\\'s also dying . \\nthis got to me . \\ni love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me . \\nwe also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but \\nthis is never answered , as this film is too cluttered . \\nbut in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma . \\nfor one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do . \\nand there are some nice touches . \\nwhen they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient\\'s belongings in a room and we see the riddler\\'s costume . \\ni laughed . \\nand during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as \" droogs \" from \" a clockwork orange . \" \\ni laughed at all these . \\nthe film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or \\ndid it just feel like that ? \\nthe film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays . \\npeople are fed up with stupid films . \\nthat\\'s why the word of mouth killed \" the lost world ! \" \\nthat\\'s why last year , indy films grossed more than ever . \\nthat\\'s why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it . \\nthat\\'s why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo\\'s \" face/off \" and barry sonnenfeld\\'s \" men in black , \" both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on . \\ni like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste . \\ni like some of his films ( \" flatliners , \" \" a time to kill \" ) but a lot of them suck . \\nhe\\'s a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that\\'s what makes him great . \\nbut his costuming for woody allen\\'s \" sleeper \" was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) . \\ni love the \" batman \" series . \\nthe first two rocked and i did like the last one . \\nbut this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three . \\nhopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time . \\nand maybe they\\'ll get smart and bring back catwoman . \\nand michael keaton . \\nbut we can only hope . \\n',\n"," b'warren beatty\\'s \" bulworth \" is a caustic political comedy that doesn\\'t attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system . \\nsome might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is . \\nhowever , as loud and raucous as it is , \" bulworth \" speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear . \\nbeatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( \" the lemon sisters \" ) , stars as incumbent u . s . senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history . \\nbulworth is a democrat , and in beatty\\'s view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party . \\nonce an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington . \\ninstead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he\\'s not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he\\'s making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , \" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . . \\nblah , blah , blah . \" \\nwhen the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become . \\nin a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn\\'t know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place . \\nknowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general . \\nat a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they \" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife . \" \\nlater , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he\\'s there is because \" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . \" \\nall throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth\\'s chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment . \\nplatt has some of the movie\\'s funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet . \\nhis constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth\\'s stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy\\'s refusal to explain bulworth\\'s actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason . \\nwhen bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who\\'s trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews . \\nat this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience . \\nbulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally . \\nshe has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d . \\n ( don cheadle of \" boogie nights \" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth\\'s campaign . \\nsome of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like \" boyz\\'n\\'hood \" ( 1991 ) and \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) . \\n \" bulworth\\'s \" chief liability is beatty\\'s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device . \\ninstead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black . \\nit\\'s hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he\\'s actually that incompetent . \\nat any rate , the rap sounds more run d . m . c . \\nthan snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary . \\nbeatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j . \\nother than that , \" bulworth \" hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy . \\nthe film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don\\'t agree with beatty\\'s liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics . \\nunlike \" primary colors \" which opened earlier this year , \" bulworth \" doesn\\'t try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead-on . \\n',\n"," b'i\\'m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream , but i\\'m guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft . \\nseriously , this idea--a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends--is a great one and i wish it could have been pulled off . \\nthe first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue . \\nan example : \" that [car crash] must\\'ve been awful . . . for \\neveryone involved . \" \\nyou can tell that the writer intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said , just no one figured out what . \\ni know in slasher movies there isn\\'t supposed to be a lot of great characterization and i myself don\\'t mind cardboard cutouts , but please don\\'t let the cutouts be so damn bland . \\none reason movies like scream , star wars and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters . \\naside from jared leto and joshua jackson ( who aren\\'t on the screen long enough ) no one in urban legend makes the grade . \\nalicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill , rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive ( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3/4 of the film ) and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot . \\ngood thing brad dourif is here , but wait . . . he\\'s only in the movie for five minutes _and_ he\\'s just redoing his good-natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest . \\nwhich brings me to another aspect of urban legend : it\\'s unoriginality . \\nthe film most blatantly ripped off is scream ( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven\\'s and williamson\\'s great success ) . \\nurban legend tries to deconstruct modern-day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films , but it doesn\\'t quite succeed . \\nit\\'s best stab at self-reflexivity is poking fun at \" that girl in the noxzeema ad \" ( ie , rebecca gayheart ) we also have another killer-taunting-his-victim-on-the-phone routine in urban legend and quick , what movie is this exchange of dialogue from : \\nfemale protagonist : why ? \\nvillain : why ? \\nwhy ? ! ? \\ncongratulations to those of you who answered scream and/or urban legend . \\nlike i said , this movie could\\'ve been great . \\nif only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a little longer on the script . \\nstill , at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer . \\n',\n"," b\"the premise is simple , if not bizarre . \\na mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . \\nwhy ? \\nit's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun . \\nbased on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . \\nmike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . \\nthe catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live . \\ndr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . \\nthe purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . \\nwe watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . \\nin this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth . \\nwe basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . \\nthe plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one . \\nthis island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . \\ntogether the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . \\nto make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . \\nmst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . \\nas funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . \\noccasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . \\nalthough it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . \\nmst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . \\nalthough i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . \\nwarning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . \\nthe name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . \\nmost people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film . \\n\",\n"," b'cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins . \\nwhile he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here . \\nthe story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i\\'ll try my best and explain it as simply as possible . \\nthe film is based on a \" mostly \" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down . \\nit\\'s during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor . \\nbetween this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated . \\nalso along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience . \\ntim robbin\\'s just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out . \\nfor robbin\\'s it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits . \\ni thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast , unfortunately are all uninteresting , except for a few . \\nlet me recap what each important character does , so please bear with me ( it\\'s the least you can do , especially if you were considering seeing this ) . \\ni\\'ll begin with those involved with the play . \\nthere\\'s orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock . \\noutside the play there\\'s the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who\\'s unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack ) . \\nthere\\'s a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story . \\nanyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except for emily watson , who does another great job , and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack , who always delivers through thick and thin . \\nnow although most of the film was weak to say the least , there were some nice moments and some involving subjects , but all this is overblown . \\nsure the free speech segment was a nice feature , but not when it becomes repetitive . \\nthe whole film is like this , and it\\'s basically nothing but a headache . \\non the brighter side , tim robbin\\'s direction was masterful . \\nhis camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson\\'s latest magnolia , only smoother in my opinion , but even that can\\'t make a movie that much better . \\nalthough it has it\\'s moments ( not many of them , but they\\'re there ) , cradle will rock stays true to it\\'s title , because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over . \\n',\n"," b'satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . \\n \" dr . \\nstrangelove \" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . \\n \" men in black \" ) . \\nwhat\\'s unique about \" wag the dog \" is that it doesn\\'t necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . \\nthe result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . \\nif there\\'s anything that affects americans the most it\\'s politics and showbusiness . \\nin this age of information and technology , we\\'ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it\\'s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . \\nwe need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . \\nthis film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn\\'t someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? \\nthat\\'s the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president\\'s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . \\nbrean , along with the president\\'s top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . \\nthey pitch him an idea to \" produce \" the image of a war with albania ( it\\'s a country no one\\'s heard of so they people will buy it ) . \\nsoon the wheels are in motion and the film\\'s riffing satire comes into play . \\nwe\\'re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . \\nthe initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . \\nthe characters\\' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . \\nfor example , one scene shows motss and brean\\'s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . \\nmotss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . \\nsince it\\'s all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . \\nthis demonstrates the film\\'s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . \\nbut then there\\'s the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress\\'s name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , \" this is nothing ! \" \\nby the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . \\nthe first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . \\nevery ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it\\'s always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . \\nthe screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . \\nhowever , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . \\nas the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . \\nwhat had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . \\nstill , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . \\nwillie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . \\ntruly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and \" wag the dog \" at least succeeds in this respect . \\nhowever , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . \\nthen again , it\\'s a valiant effort . \\n',\n"," b\"staring , george clooney , arnold schwarzenegger , chris o'donnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone . \\nwell to start this off i'd just like to say a couple things . \\nfirst is , i miss michael keaton , i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence . \\nnot even from the first film was batman really the 'star' though he was damn close in the first couple anyway . \\nin 'batman forever' and now in 'batman & robin' he's almost pushed to being a bit player . \\ni can't really say if clooney ( who regardless was better than kilmer ) was a very good batman or not . \\nhe's given next to nothing to do at all , he might as well not have been there and it wouldn't have made much difference . \\nnow , joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wont make batman brooding and dark . \\nfine , i mean granted 'batman returns' while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes . \\nyet his bright neon , campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me . \\ni'm usually very easy on films . \\ni loved 'con air' and other films some critics have slammed . \\ngranted that film really was paper thin , cliche ridden , except for one thing , it was fun . \\nthere is virtually no fun in this film at all . \\ni couldn't have cared less . \\nit'll thrill the little ones as theres no violence really , none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing . \\nschwarzenegger is awful , i mean really , really bad . . . \\nand this is coming from a regular fan of his work . \\ni love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them . \\nhe talks all to often in this movie . \\ni would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll . \\ni believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film . \\ni liked alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap shot . \\n\",\n"," b'in december of 1996 , a little movie called \" scream , \" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens . \\nfirst , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both \" scream \" movies , \" i know what you did last summer , \" \" urban legend , \" etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a \\'la \\'80s john hughes ) , starting with last june\\'s \" can\\'t hardly wait . \" \\nit may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : \" varsity blues , \" \" jawbreaker , \" \" cruel intentions , \" \" simply irresistible , \" \" the rage : carrie 2 , \" and \" the mod squad . \" \\ncoming april 9 are two more of this type : \" never been kissed \" and \" go , \" and on april 23 , we\\'ve got the teen satire \" election \" and the teen horror-comedy \" idle hands . \" \\njeesh ! \\nout of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" is this past january\\'s mediocre , ho-hum \" she\\'s all that . \" \\nalthough similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" a modern-day version of shakespeare\\'s \" the taming of the shrew \" ( \" she\\'s all that \" got its inspiration from \" pygmalion \" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985\\'s \" the breakfast club . \" \\nand to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn\\'t have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in \" she\\'s all that ? \" ) . \\nthe day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . \\nalthough he doesn\\'t know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won\\'t allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . \\nkat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \\ncomplicating matters , cameron\\'s dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . \\nas you can see , \" 10 things i hate about you \" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven\\'t even mentioned , such as kat\\'s shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca\\'s materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . \\nat a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of \" she\\'s all that , \" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , \" you\\'re vapor \" ) . \\nsince i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . \\naside from a good screenplay , it\\'s the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . \\naside from joseph gordon-levitt ( \" 3rd rock from the sun \" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . \\nas the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries \" the \\'60s \" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . \\neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat\\'s way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . \\nno one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . \\nheath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . \\none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . \\nin one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . \\none off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school\\'s staff act , which is strikingly unformal . \\nallison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl \" chill \" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . \\nalthough there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . \\nin one very funny scene , chastity asks , \" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? \" \\nat another point , bianca and kat\\'s father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it\\'s like to be pregnant . \\n \" 10 things i hate about you \" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the \\'90s . \\nit also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave \\'80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . \\nby the film\\'s end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . \\nluckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about \" 10 things i hate about you , \" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten . \\n',\n"," b\"the thirteenth floor is a bland , obligatory exercise in genre film-making . \\nif i hadn't recently watched the matrix and open your eyes -- both of which are similar but far superior -- i might have been a little nicer to this picture . \\ncraig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall , the rich co-creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss ( armin mueller-stahl ) . \\neverything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one , and characters stare at each other for maddeningly-long periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level . \\nthe acting is okay , but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of , and features a script ( co-penned by director josef rusnak ) loaded with cliches and stock characters . \\nthere are individual scenes and ideas that work -- i like the thought of a sentient computer program -- but none of the film's strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree . \\nproducer roland emmerich , based on this and his previous directorial efforts , seems hell-bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre science-fiction . \\n\",\n"," b'we all know the fate of \" child\\'s play , \" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell . \\nwith the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be \" bride of chucky \" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it\\'s kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about . \\nalas , the original \" child\\'s play \" actually isn\\'t that bad . \\neven seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn\\'t the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don\\'t believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn\\'t a bad movie . \\nit\\'s not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don\\'t have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , \" i know what you did last summer \" has recently gone . \\nthe premise of \" child\\'s play \" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid\\'s doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid\\'s doll i\\'ve ever seen . \\nthe next day , a bum who\\'s stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday . \\nof course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up . \\nlike the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy . \\nand soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn\\'t just a kiddie doll one by one . \\nthe idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that . \\nit plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they\\'re crazy . \\nit plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments . \\neven if there\\'s an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) , \\nthere\\'s also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience . \\nthe ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with . \\nif there\\'s one horrible thing about many horror films , it\\'s that the protagonists are morons who you can\\'t help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , \" child\\'s play \" steers away from that . \\nand most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look ! \\nthat doll\\'s moving on its own ! ) , but because he\\'s a generally scary character . \\nif there\\'s anything really wrong with \" child\\'s play , \" it\\'s that it\\'s too trite and has too less self esteem . \\nat almost 90 minutes , \" child\\'s play \" features way too less to be a real classic of horror . \\nit throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren\\'t for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll . \\nif the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which \\nisn\\'t necessarily a bad thing . \\nas such , \" child\\'s play \" is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film . \\n',\n"," b\"this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time . \\na fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone's favorite goalie-mask-wearing homicidal maniac . \\njason , the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area , doesn't start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel . \\nwhile he does have a small role in this film , we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count . \\nthe plot , like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this -- crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he/she/it possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie . \\nthe reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story . \\nbut for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot , here are the basics . \\na bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp . \\nthey are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids . \\nsadly , they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer . \\nat this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting , directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production . \\nsince i'm not going to do that , feel free to assume that if i did , it wouldn't be positive . \\ni will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks , and that includes the actors' salaries . \\nif you are used to recent horror films like scream , you are in for a bit of a surprise . \\nthe only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind , with the killer taking real pride in their work . \\nusing as many methods of murder as they could . \\nnone of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre , or the creatively stifled imagination of halloween's michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife . \\nnope , in the friday the 13th movies , you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work . \\none fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon , although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again . \\nthe main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning . \\nif not , stick with the later films with jason , everyone's favorite hockey fan . \\nfriday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get a couple of scares from , just don't sit down expecting a whole lot . \\n\",\n"," b'romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant . \\nwith director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . \\nthose mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay . \\ncall me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don\\'t seem to mix well . \\ngary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . \\nhis cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn\\'t provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character . \\njack has become addicted to \" feeding the hole \" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . \\nwhen he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . \\ngary oldman\\'s performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored . \\nin the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider . \\ndemarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world . \\nthis character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can\\'t remember seeing a character quite like her . \\nafter being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety . \\nwhat a woman ! \\nlena olin\\'s performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film . \\nanabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo\\'s wife . \\nthere is little insight into her character . \\nshe\\'s depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house . \\njuliette lewis , as romeo\\'s girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis\\' portrayal certainly didn\\'t improve it . \\nboth women were anything but sexy or attractive . \\npoorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems . \\nit is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something . \\nfor example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene . \\nfine . \\njack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite . \\nfine . \\nwhat does jack proceed to do ? \\nhe brushes his friends off by telling them he isn\\'t feeling well , then strolls over to the boss . \\nwhy ? \\nthe boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack\\'s toes by the gravesite . \\ni guess they weren\\'t worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . . \\nor here\\'s another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw . \\nshe proceeded to set the place on fire . \\nwouldn\\'t the flames burn off the fingerprints ? \\naren\\'t dental records more important ? \\nas bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn\\'t she come up with a better plot ? \\n ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . ) \\nlack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film . \\nthis film doesn\\'t even add up the large details . \\nthere is little or no consistency in the story-line . \\nnot much makes sense . \\nthe direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable . \\nthe moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one . \\nso while it certainly isn\\'t reservoir dogs , it certainly isn\\'t diva . \\nthere\\'s plenty more to tear apart in this film . \\nmy advice to someone who hasn\\'t seen it to to wait until it comes on video . \\nthere are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously . \\nit\\'s not a boring film , just not a good one . \\nor an intelligent one . \\n',\n"," b' \" you\\'ve got mail \" is the very definition of a \" cute \" movie . \\nit\\'s got cute stars , a cute story-line , and even cute pets . \\ndespite this over-whelming cuteness ( or maybe because of it ) , i loved \" you\\'ve got mail \" . \\ni know , i know . \\ni\\'m supposed to be a film critic . \\ni\\'m not supposed to love transparent and formula pictures like this . \\nbut darn it , somewhere along the way , \" you\\'ve got mail \" reeled me in , hook , line , and sinker . \\nthe movie stars tom hanks and meg ryan as two somewhat unhappy new yorkers who meet in an aol online chat room and quickly become close friends , without ever knowing each others identity . \\nas the movie progresses , though , they begin to discover that they have a lot in common with each

. \\nnevertheless , i quite enjoyed it . \\nin fact , i can\\'t remember the last time i had such a good time at the movies . \\ni think sometimes you have to be able to watch a movie and just get drawn into it . \\nthe fact that stars hank and ryan are at the top of their game does not hurt either . \\nin particular , hanks is at his best here , turning his \" charm-meter \" up to 11 . \\neverytime he was on screen , he had my full attention . \\nand despite the fact that he was driving little bookstores out of business , i was rooting for him . \\nit was good to see hanks back doing what he does best : playing the affable everyman . \\n \" you\\'ve got mail \" certainly won\\'t be winning any awards , but as an exercise in pure entertainment , it\\'s as good as it gets . \\n',\n"," b'john boorman\\'s \" zardoz \" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own . \\nnot since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time . \\nof course , wood\\'s career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent . \\nboorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain \" zardoz \" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful \" exorcist ii : the heretic \" ) . \\nboorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn\\'t know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent . \\nthis is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece \" deliverance \" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama \" hope and glory \" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic \" excalibur \" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure \" the emerald forest \" ( 1985 ) . \\nhis films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste . \\nif boorman is anything , he\\'s ambitious , and when he succeeds , it\\'s in grand fashion . \\nunfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around . \\n \" zardoz \" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman\\'s . \\nhis screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even \" the wizard of oz , \" a book which figures into the movie\\'s plot . \\nbut , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling . \\nthe events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found . \\nin fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions . \\nit\\'s more middle ages than space age . \\nthe world of \" zardoz \" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life . \\nthese immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society . \\nhowever , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years . \\nif someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals . \\none of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed . \\nlike \" the wizard of oz , \" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head . \\n ( this flying head is one of the movie\\'s opening images , and it\\'s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . ) \\ncalling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can\\'t procreate and take up more resources . \\nfrom inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , \" the gun is good . \\nthe penis is evil . \" \\nthat line alone is worth the movie\\'s cult following . \\none day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz\\'s flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex . \\nonce there , the immortals label him a \" brutal \" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them . \\nthey seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up . \\ni say \" hilarious \" because that is exactly what \" zardoz \" is . \\nit is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn\\'t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming . \\njust looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker . \\nboorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of \" deliverance , \" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort . \\nhe attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( \" 2001 \" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in \" zardoz \" besides the inadvertent humor . \\nsean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace . \\nhe got exactly that in \" zardoz , \" and it\\'s a wonder it didn\\'t end his career . \\ni\\'m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements . \\nis it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ? \\nis it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ? \\nor is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ? \\nkarl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary . \\ncome to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip . \\npeople high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy . \\n',\n"," b'senseless ( r ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian , and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life . \\nalas , moments are simply that , moments , which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise . \\ngranted , that one joke is initially amusing . \\nwhen wayans\\'s darryl witherspoon , an economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses . \\nafter some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm . \\nat this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him--yes--senseless . \\nthis sets up some showcase moments for wayans\\'s gift for physical comedy , especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely , hilariously limp . \\nbut these gags , and the gag behind the entire movie , quickly grows stale . \\nonce darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses , instead of exploring any new comic territory , director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness . \\nwayans approaches each go-round with gusto , but by this point he\\'s simply treading water for the rest of the film\\'s unfunny duration . \\nsenseless would not be as problematic as it is if it didn\\'t strive to be anything more than a comic trifle . \\nhowever , the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity . \\ndarryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family , and this \" serious \" angle seems to come from an entirely different movie . \\nunlike wayans\\'s last starring vehicle , the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man , the \" emotional \" content of senseless is forced and unconvincing . \\nany attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl\\'s romance with janice ( tamara taylor ) , a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself , does not generate sparks of any kind . \\nonce his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end , the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him . \\nbut if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless , his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother , damon , who is now set to make his comeback--on television . \\n',\n"," b'one-sided \" doom and gloom \" documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible . \\norson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events . \\nthe film is dated badly , as many things that are supposed to happen in the \" future \" never do . \\nfor example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth . \\nwe\\'re still here . \\nthe arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse . \\nwe\\'re still here . \\nsome of the more ludicrous moments come when it\\'s alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) . \\nalso , there\\'s ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like .

another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods . \\naudio is mono dolby digital , and the video is fair to good for a film like this . \\ni believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me . \\ncertainly i never expected a remastered print . \\ncuriously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case . \\nbut they\\'re menu screens . . . \\nso who really cares ? \\n[pg] \\n',\n"," b\"unfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than one tough cop . \\nthere's the renegade cop with the loser partner who has to many problems to explain . \\nthe renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film . \\nbo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia . \\non top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn ) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets ( i guess cops aren't immune ? ) . \\nthen , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) . \\nright there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama . \\nbut right in the middle of the film , they throw in a completely un-related plot point . \\ndietl and his partner duke try to solve a case that they have been warned to stay away from . \\nthe film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun who was beaten and raped to near death . \\nonce the case is solved , the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue . \\nwhatever neat mesh the screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably . \\naside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso ( an insult if you ask me ) the performances were pretty good . \\nbaldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop . \\npenn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop . \\nwhat one tough cop lacks is originality . \\nthis film offers nothing new . \\nnothing that you can't get from any cop film . \\nit screams sidney lumet all over the place , perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet's dog day afternoon and serpico . \\nbut even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film . \\ntoo much else is lacking . \\ni also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture , something that i almost never notice . \\nbut once i saw that , i had it in the back of my mind every time i saw a medium or long shot . \\nat times , i was hoping to see it . \\none tough cop isn't laughable , nor is it a terrible film , but it just isn't unique . \\nit is a classic example of a film that didn't need to be made . \\nbut one thing is for sure , it could really use a better title . \\n\",\n"," b'call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \\nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it\\'s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \\nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \\nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \\nthat\\'s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \\nthey haven\\'t spoken in years , and wouldn\\'t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren\\'t for kaisa\\'s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \\nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \\n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \\ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \\nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn\\'t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \\ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn\\'t fallen very far from the tree . \\nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \\nain\\'t they a pair ? \\nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \\nby the time they reach the hospital , it\\'s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they\\'re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \\nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \\naberdeen doesn\\'t know where else to go . \\nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \\nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \\nheadey\\'s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \\nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she\\'d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \\nit\\'s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter\\'s captivating signs & wonders . \\nit\\'s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they\\'re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \\nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \\nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \\ndespite skarsg ? rd\\'s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \\nthere\\'s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \\nnossiter\\'s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \\nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it\\'s willing to stretch beyond what we\\'ve come to expect from traditional drama . \\naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \\nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \\nthe

mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks . \\nnow i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films . \\nso i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda . \\nsee it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video . \\nsee the best film i have seen in 1996 . \\nnot the best children\\'s film . . . the \\nbest film . \\nperiod . \\nbased on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict . \\nthe wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books . \\nwhen they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) . \\nbut things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness . \\nmatilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull\\'s cruelty . \\nit was this spring\\'s james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda . \\nand just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito . \\ndevito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images . \\nin one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert . \\nmatilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale . \\nit is also characteristic of the best children\\'s tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don\\'t realize that they are learning them . \\nthere is a hilarious moment when matilda\\'s television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around . \\nmatilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because \" i\\'m big and you\\'re little , i\\'m right and you\\'re wrong . \" \\nmore specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people\\'s notions of how she should behave . \\nit is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women . \\nfinally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word . \\ndevito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house . \\nthe child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character . \\nbut there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda\\'s classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda\\'s father . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted . \\nmatilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling . \\ni will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my

he can\\'t take out the two cops who are after him , despite having shot one of them a total of seven times . \\ncomments : the most notable aspect of adrenalin : fear the rush is that it marks a striking career move for natasha henstridge . \\nnot only does she manage to keep all her clothes on ( her trademark in earlier films such as species and maximum risk was to strip naked as often as possible ) , but she actually puts on even more clothes as the film progresses . \\nthis will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it doesn\\'t show in this mess ) . \\nhenstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey . \\n ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films . ) \\nhow on earth this movie got two big-name stars to appear in it is beyond me . \\nadrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 ) . \\nboston has changed dramatically in those ten years . \\nit is now home to a bunch of interred

brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him . \\nthat\\'s it . \\n76 minutes never seemed so long . \\nthis is a drawn-out chase scene through dimly-lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie . \\nthe plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert\\'s character and very little about henstridge\\'s character . \\nthe dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor/tunnel/airduct next and who will carry the flashlight . \\na subplot does exist involving henstridge\\'s character\\'s illegal attempt to get her son out of boston . \\nin her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son . \\ntwenty minutes into the film , i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot . \\nin a defining scene of the movie , however , i changed my mind . \\nthis fake passport drops to the ground . \\nlambert\\'s cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away . \\nmust not have been a good fake . \\nthis emphasizes another fault with the film . \\nthings just defy common sense . \\nlambert\\'s cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about . \\nadrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that doesn\\'t seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for . \\ni found myself rather bored with this film , which will disappoint

charges . \\ndo anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' . \\ni figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so . \\nthe film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' . \\nmeg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease . \\nwhile this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery . \\n`hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests . \\nfor the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development . \\nthis is an annoying and ineffective device . \\ncell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems . \\nif `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . \\ngranted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film . \\nbut they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck . \\nthe most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . \\nwe are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . \\ngeorgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . . \\n`georgia' . \\nmaddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog . \\nryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' . \\nkudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted . \\nditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle . \\nher frenzy is apparent . \\nfor a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles . \\nthe reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing . \\neven so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . \\nthat about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . \\nmy curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour . \\nbut really , it's no mystery . \\nthe predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses . \\npin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations . \\nit's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable . \\nuh-uh . \\nit's a wrong number from the beginning . \\n\",\n"," b\"in the first death wish movie , mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey , played by charles bronson , was avenging the death of his wife . \\nin the second , he was avenging his daughter . \\nin the third , he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend . \\nfourth movie , on the other hand , begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen , played by kay lenz . \\nhowever , since this is death wish movie , we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for . \\nthis time karen's teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways . \\nkersey's new targets , unlike the previous movies , aren't the ordinary street punks but rich , heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers . \\neven such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support , and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan ) , determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter . \\nwhite's plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them . \\nthe plan begins to take shape , but kersey's actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) . \\nfourth ( and , unfortunately , not the final ) installment in the death wish series , will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group , production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade . \\nhowever , although some critics might argue , death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey , one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s , is still being dumbed down by mediocre script , and charles bronson really doesn't feel the need to put much effort in his acting . \\nhowever , the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winner's and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal , although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring . \\nthere are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence , and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end . \\nthe script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenz's character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years . \\nthere are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional , like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronson's 1970s classics . \\n ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi , the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files , could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) . \\n\",\n"," b'ladies and gentlemen , payback is the most expensive episode of \" the equalizer \" i\\'ve ever seen . \\ngibson plays porter , a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife ( deborah kara unger , in an all-too-brief cameo ) and partner ( henry ) after a successful heist . \\nas a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porter\\'s back , porter miraculously springs back to life . \\nhe makes it his mission , as a walking dead man without a conscience , to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot . \\n ( in a running gag , porter demands $70 000 , but everybody mishears him and assumes he\\'s after the entire $130 000 haul . ) \\nin his travels ( or travails ) , porter encounters several other one-named villainous cretins like fairfax ( james coburn as a white-haired , millionaire thief ) and carter ( kristofferson , as a brown-haired , millionaire thief-the kingpin of the obligatory \" operation \" ) . \\nhelgeland\\'s film ( which was recut by mel the producer ) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm . \\nthe novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly : a ) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs , and b ) because mel\\'s schtick doesn\\'t evolve from act one-he\\'s the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci-fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone . \\npayback should have been called playback : it\\'s a 102-minute loop of the same short sequence . \\n ( mel : \" i want my money . \" \\nanonymous villain : \" no . \" \\nmel shoots gun . \\nanonymous villain dies . \\nmel meets up with his hooker friend ( bello ) . \\nsecond verse , same as the first . ) \\nit\\'s not porter\\'s single-mindedness that robs the film of snap , crackle , and pop ; as a character who has already \" died \" once , he has nothing to lose and so much to gain . \\nthe movie lacks danger . \\nthe only thing porter is in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep . \\npayback has a gritty , metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous ; its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months . \\n ( director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello , so va-va-va-voom in permanant midnight , to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig . ) \\nto analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves . \\nperhaps only someone as experienced with antagonists-as-protagonists as tarantino-look what he did with the similar hero-less botched-robbery tale reservoir dogs-could have pulled off this material ( a loose remake of john boorman\\'s point blank ) . \\nthe movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction ( all women are femme fatales ; even the cops are in on it , etc . ) and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas ( death is never in the cards for the main character , etc . ) but transcends neither . \\n',\n"," b'these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes . \\nbut , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers . \\nsequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south . \\nthe way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place . \\none of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade . \\nin order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 . \\nseven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america . \\nthis time , however , third time wasn\\'t the charm and beverly hills iii was failure . \\neddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback . \\neddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop . \\nthe routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley\\'s boss . \\ndetermined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) . \\nwhen it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles . \\nthere , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring . \\nten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different . \\nin this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply doesn\\'t work . \\nscreenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys . \\nsince foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile . \\nunfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children . \\nnice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath . \\nunlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply can\\'t balance the comedy with \" regular \" action , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects . \\naction scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat . \\nto make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) . \\nin the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there aren\\'t any plans for beverly hills iv . \\n',\n"," b'nostalgia for the 70s continues , as we see a revival of one of the decade\\'s greatest achievements : the marijuana comedy . \\nhowever half baked doesn\\'t quite run with all its brain cells , and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more . \\nthe plot follows the misadventures of four ne\\'er-do-well stoners . \\nthere\\'s the group\\'s unofficial leader , thurgood ( david chappelle ) , scarface ( guillermo diaz ) , brian ( jim breuer ) , and kenny ( harland williams ) . \\nkenny gets into trouble , when , while on a munchie run , feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse . \\nwhen the animal keels over , he finds himself accused of killing a police officer , and facing a $1 , 000 , 000 bail . \\nhis friends promise to raise money for a 10% bail bond , but have no idea how . \\nthat is , until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor . \\nsoon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds , while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson ( clarence williams iii ) . \\nfor a comedy , the film is pretty humorless . \\nnot that it doesn\\'t try . . . it\\'s \\njust that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat . \\nthe four leads are nearly all playing the same character . \\nonly williams stands out ( while still performing on the level of his humor-free comedy rocket man ) , but that is because he\\'s imprisoned throughout most of the film , giving a much needed change of pace ( but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another ) . \\nto help out , the film is packed full of cameos . \\nsteven wright , tommy chong , janeane garofalo , willie nelson , snoop doggy dogg , and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another . \\nnone of them work , beyond the simple \" hey , that\\'s _____ \" level . \\nin fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle . \\nnot as his bland pothead lead , but in his second role , as a pot-obsessed rapper , sir smokealot . \\ngranted , it\\'s pretty much a one-joke role , and there aren\\'t a ton of laughs . . . but this film needs every one it can scrape up . \\nto top it off , and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film , thurgood is given a love interest , mary jane ( rachel true ) . \\nher role is that of the public service announcement : to inform us why doing drugs ( including pot ) is wrong . \\nher character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the \" your film promotes the use of drugs \" camp . \\nthe film would have been better off by sticking with the \" rebel \" tone it so eagerly tries to claim . \\nyet , in the end , it doesn\\'t really matter . \\nwatching the film clean and sober , you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is . \\n',\n"," b'showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer . \\ntheir last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone\\'s taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie . \\npossibly that movie\\'s greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . . \\nand that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters\\' future , so there was no need to film it . \\nthere was actually about four hours\\' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails . \\nthe major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls . \\nwe have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who\\'s trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . . \\nbut recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner . \\nin this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who\\'s not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we\\'re left feeling good about her future . \\nthis is not one of the great movies , but it\\'s far better than we\\'d been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity . \\nverhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making . \\nhis most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he\\'s exploring the sleeze . \\nthis movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director\\'s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie . \\n ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . ) \\nmany reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it\\'s about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist . \\nit\\'s about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power . \\nit\\'s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don\\'t pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment . \\nan nc-17 movie which isn\\'t sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value . \\nthe one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator . \\nif anything , it\\'s a rape scene with a victim who\\'s been duped into cooperation . \\nyou don\\'t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don\\'t make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don\\'t make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . . \\nand in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing . \\nthis is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity . \\nshowgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness . \\nnomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who\\'s at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she\\'s known . \\nshe has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be . \\nwhen nomi realizes she\\'s gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be . \\ngina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi\\'s entire life . \\nmolly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she\\'ll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi\\'s feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi\\'s decision . \\ngina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who\\'s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her . \\ngershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness . \\nher character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi . \\nthe relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path . \\nit is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality . \\ncristal is a talented dancer who\\'s compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas . \\nnomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn\\'t need las vegas or its brand of \" stardom . \" \\nthe male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist . \\nkyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy . \\nglenn plummer plays a dancer who\\'s working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective . \\nplummer\\'s character is the only one in the movie who\\'s maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he\\'s succumbed to the cult of manipulation . \\nplummer\\'s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie . \\nsome of jost vacano\\'s cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi\\'s character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying . \\nthis movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well . \\ni don\\'t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making . \\nbut don\\'t go see it if you\\'re not in a tough mood ; the only person it\\'s possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u . \\non life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you\\'d enjoy meeting in person . \\n',\n"," b\"chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus , we now have an ice cream truck . \\nthe truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr . ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) , who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder . \\nthis particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees , or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radius . \\nthat would be pretty nasty . \\nthe power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene , as dr . richard long ( david paymer ) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island . \\nlong accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island , due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance . \\nthe commanding officer , general brynner ( peter firth ) , is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops . \\nupon his release , the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down , snatching elvis , and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder . \\nprotecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ( ulrich ) and a feisty ice cream delivery man ( gooding jr . ) , who must elude brynner's men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder . \\nall the while , of course , they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees . \\nthis proves to be tricky . \\namong the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat , and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle . \\nthey also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing . \\nto put it simply , i'll use a clever pun : chill factor should be put on ice . \\ndirector hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed , broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie . \\nwhen there is some occasional action , the audience seems oddly detached from it . \\nperhaps that's because we've already waded through a pool of clich ? s and boring dialogue ; all material that's been used before , and with a lot more spice . \\ntake the villains , for example . \\nthey are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen . \\nthey speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next , divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint , and act in very predictable ways . \\nthe tag-team of gooding jr . and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is . \\nfrankly , i'm not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man . \\ni suppose it's better than him dressed like a giant hot dog , selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner . \\ngooding displays one single emotion in this movie , which is frequently on display in lines like `i'm gonna get on yo ass like last year's underwear ! ' and the incessant sputtering of `oh , sh * t ! ' \\nthis is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets . \\nbut where gooding was once an exciting actor , he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous . \\nat least he's a bit more captivating than ulrich , who has all the film's worst dialogue , but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character . \\nthe supporting cast , which includes every personality you expect to pop up , is also wasted . \\nto be fair , there are a few brief moments of serviceable action . \\nand i did chuckle a few times . \\none example is when ulrich ( an employee at `darlene's diner' ) is at the counter when brynner walks through the door . \\n`you own this place ? ' \\nthe general asks . \\n`yeah , ' ulrich says . \\n`they call me darlene . ' \\nthese little tidbits of humor are ( mainly ) welcome in this weak , disappointing wreckage of an action film . \\nas a speed clone , it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps ( god forbid ) even some decent writing . \\nsadly , i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been . \\n\",\n"," b'movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers . \\noccasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called \" teenagers . \" \\ncan\\'t hardly wait , however , does not . \\ninstead , the writing/directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to . \\ncan\\'t hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation . \\nthe main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there\\'s the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) , prom queen and cheerleader amanda ( jennifer love-hewitt ) , football star mike ( peter facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe kenny ( seth green ) , computer geek william ( charlie korsmo ) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) . \\ni couldn\\'t stand any of those characters . \\nwhether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming \" yo , i gotta have sex tonight ! \" , \\nall i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film . \\napparently , can\\'t hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it\\'s not funny . \\nin all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour . \\nand when i say \" forced \" , i mean it . \\nthey should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange . \\nthis is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour . \\nfor instance , can\\'t hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as \" i am a sex machine . \" \\nfor some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny . \\nif only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that\\'s funny . \\n',\n"," b'i\\'m going to start this review off with a hypothetical question . \\nlet\\'s say you\\'ve just been in a car accident , and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious . \\nyour friends have left to go get help , and you\\'re waiting to see if the victim wakes up . \\na tow-truck comes along , and the driver hops out of the truck to see what\\'s going on . \\nhe then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck . \\ndo you : \\na ) run away screaming for your life , staying away from the main road , \\nb ) run away ( but not too fast ) and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you , * stop * to catch your breath , try to negotiate with the psycho , and when that fails , start running away again , all the while * staying on the main road * ? \\nif you answered \" a \" , you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of \" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation \" and will likely hate this movie . \\nhowever , if you answered \" b \" , prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind ! \\n \" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation \" is being called a sequel , but it\\'s really more of a remake of the original . \\nthere\\'s a few changes here and there , but it\\'s essentially the same ( even the infamous \" meathook \" scene has been re-created . ) \\nthe story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom , and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere . \\nneedless to say , they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family . \\nmuch carnage ensues . \\nto call this movie inept would be putting it mildly . \\nin addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question , there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere . \\nit just swoops down and kills him with its wheel . \\nno explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he/she is going around killing people with the planes wheel . \\nthe dialogue is even more atrocious . \\nzellwegger , who is kidnapped by \" the family \" early on , keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people . \\nwhen you\\'re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses , i would think that rationality would go out the window . \\nspeaking of going out the window , there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window . \\napparently , the stunt double had a little trouble , because she visibly gets stuck in the window . \\nthe director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double * doesn\\'t * get caught in the window . \\nthis was one of many glaring inconsistencies . \\nthere are so many , in fact , that if i were to name them all , this review would be several pages long . \\nthe only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey . \\nhe plays a member of \" the family \" with a hydraulic leg ( home-made , i might add ) and is so completely over-the-top , you can\\'t help but be amazed by his performance . \\nhe obviously had a lot of fun with this part , and it really shows . \\nhe makes jack nicholson\\'s portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in \" the shining \" look restrained in comparison . \\nfor a horror movie , \" texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation \" contains surprisingly little gore . \\nin fact , in contains none . \\nthere\\'s a little blood here and there , but that\\'s as far as it goes . \\nwhich leads me to believe that the budget must have been * astonishingly * low , and it shows . \\neverything about the movie looks cheap , from the sets to the costumes . \\nespecially leatherface . \\nonce frightening and nightmare inducing , he\\'s now as terrifying as dame edna . \\ndo yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake . \\ncheck out the far superior original instead . \\n',\n"," b'it\\'s tough to really say something nice about a type of person who\\'s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , \" american history x \" does it , and for that , i commend it . \\nit not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who\\'s not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off . \\nthe subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack . \\nhe\\'s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks . \\nhe\\'s so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process . \\nhis name is derek vinyard , and he\\'s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he\\'s almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he\\'s clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he\\'s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn\\'t need them . \\nhe so believes in his convictions that he\\'s willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years . \\n \" american history x \" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake . \\nwe see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he\\'s done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides . \\nor at least , that\\'s the intention . \\nthe film\\'s framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek\\'s deep space 9 ) , is trying to \" correct \" him . \\nwhen the film opens , danny has just written a book report on \" mein kampf , \" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek\\'s life and how it has gotten him nowhere . \\ncoincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he\\'s cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair . \\nhe\\'s just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he\\'s wisened up . \\nhe\\'s no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who\\'s becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle . \\nbut danny won\\'t . \\nhe goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago . \\nthe film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white . \\nwe mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on . \\nto them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them . \\nand frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true . \\n \" american history x \" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next . \\nin it , there are some of the best scenes i\\'ve seen all year . \\none scene features a dinner between derek\\'s family , and his mother\\'s newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek\\'s rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould\\'s reaction to derek\\'s final summation is unnerrving ) . \\nanother scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison . \\nand another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year . \\nthere\\'s much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d\\'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he\\'s given in what seems like a really long time ) . \\nnorton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble . \\nin only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best . \\nthere\\'s nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando . \\nthat he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing . \\nsadly enough , this isn\\'t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be . \\nit\\'s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece . \\nthe ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon . \\nsome of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the \" fat skinhead , \" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn\\'t as well travelled . \\nfurlong\\'s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn\\'t seem like it has actually arrived there . \\neven derek\\'s descent into skinhead-dom doesn\\'t seem justified . \\nthough his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from \" boy meets world , \" and don\\'t ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs . \\nas such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed . \\nsorta . \\n \" american history x \" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential . \\nsomewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus . \\nalthough he aimed for the directing credit to go to \" alan smithee , \" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn\\'t allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that\\'s the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) . \\nkaye\\'s right in that it\\'s not up to par , even if he\\'s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par . \\nthis will not be a \" do the right thing \" for the late 90s . \\nyet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one\\'s own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) . \\nand even if it isn\\'t perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he\\'s done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience . \\n',\n"," b'martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger . \\nhe\\'s also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck . \\nthey basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art ) . \\ni\\'m sure the guy\\'s good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked \" under siege \" ) . \\nof course , this one , as a change , has a \" message \" that is drilled into our mind . . . of \\ncourse , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people . \\nso why do i watch his crap ? \\ni usually don\\'t . \\ni will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man\\'s movies , unless , and only unless , he\\'s in a supporting role ( i . e . \\n \" executive decision \" ) and i\\'d definitely pay if he dies ( i . e . \\n \" executive decision \" ) . \\nbut this one has a special place in my heart . \\nthis doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good or that i even liked it . \\nthis was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la \" mystery science theatre 3000 , \" and this was a couple years before i had heard of \" mystery science theatre 3000 . \" \\nin this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine . \\nit seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land . \\naround the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new \" fire down below , \" another \" message film \" ) , and caine has him bumped off . . . or \\ndoes he ? \\nseagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here . \\none of caine\\'s cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory . . . literally , \\nof course . \\nat one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn\\'t have any options but blow stuff up . \\nhe even goes as far as to say , \" i don\\'t want to kill someone , \" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is . \\ni have no problem with violence . \\ni\\'m a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence . \\nin the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them . \\nat some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does . \\nthis would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn\\'t take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer\\'s \" con air . \" \\nbut seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message . \\ni wouldn\\'t mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence . \\nbut seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer\\'s mind . \\nthe villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can\\'t take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job . \\nthen at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn\\'t get the message from the trailers . \\nwhat seagal doesn\\'t realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn\\'t comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish . \\nas far as seagal and his acting , he\\'s rather boring . \\nhe squints , he kills . \\nperiod . \\nnothing else . \\noh , yeah , there\\'s corny one-liners ( \" i\\'m gonna reach out and touch someone ! \" ) . \\nof course , he\\'s the star , and we\\'re supposed to root for him and all , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks . \\nmichael caine , who\\'s a great actor , is just supposed to yell and look cold . \\nhe does it well , i guess , but this is no \" alfie . \" \\nof coure , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him . \\nhis big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda boring as well , but is not horrible . \\nand we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from \" full metal jacket \" ) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is , just for the movie trailers and for seagal\\'s ego . \\nand also , look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey\\'s assasins . \\nanyway , to conclude this all , to judge one of seagal\\'s movies is to judge all of them ( except for \" under siege \" and \" executive decision , \" though the latter is not really a \" seagal movie \" ) . \\nthey all have this same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but this one has that message , which makes it more excrucitating to watch . \\ni mean , if you do rent it , and i don\\'t reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes . \\nbut i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad , that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one . \\nmy ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock ) \\n',\n"," b'there\\'s no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . \\nbut if it\\'s an accurate picture of life on america\\'s mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . \\nfor from the film\\'s outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction . \\nour eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be . \\nbrasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a \" wiseguy \" . \\nregrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . \\nhis concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband\\'s gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . \\ntrue , the focus on pistone\\'s family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . \\nthe unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . \\nthe biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . \\nthe awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70\\'s , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces\\' costume drama casino . \\nmore importantly , pacino\\'s presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . \\ndonnie brasco\\'s take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . \\nlefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . \\ninexplicably , lefty\\'s horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . \\nit doesn\\'t any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone\\'s . \\njust think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . \\nin these pictures pacino\\'s dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . \\ndonnie brasco\\'s tawdry little crime , therefore isn\\'t so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . \\n ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone\\'s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a \" damn you mcbain ! \" \\ni hear from springfield way ? ) \\nso the movie is cliched . \\nbig deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ? \\nwell you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . \\ndonnie brasco fails on both counts . \\nthe action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp\\'s woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades . \\nadmittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . \\ndepp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino\\'s well-earned high style . \\nthe consequences are painful to watch . \\nits no exaggeration to say that the film\\'s credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family\\'s uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner\\'s phony brooklyn accent . \\nperhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . \\nmaybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . \\nif this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america\\'s underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . \\ndepp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats . \\nwho knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? \\nbut then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn\\'t so true after all . \\n',\n"," b'like the great musical pieces of mozart himself , amadeus is a true work of art . \\nit is one of those few movies of the 80\\'s that will be known for its class , its style , and its intelligence . \\nwhy is this such a good film ? \\nthere are almost too many reasons to explain . \\nthe story : court composer salieri ( f . \\nmurray abraham ) feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart ( tom hulce ) comes into his life as the young genius composer . \\nsalieri feels envy , and jealousy , but at the same time is fascinated with mozart\\'s brilliance and ingenious . \\nwe travel through mozart\\'s life as a composer , through his struggles , his triumphs , and ultimately , his demise . \\nthe acting : abraham is magnificient as salieri ; his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language . \\nthis performance earned him a well deserved oscar . \\ntom hulce is interesting as well as mozart , a quirky , annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh . \\nhe\\'s strong , but weak at the same time , and must be aided by his wife ( elizabeth berridge ) , who is good in her role , but lacks dramatic depth . \\njeffrey jones , in a smaller , more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world , is cast perfectly because of his noble charm . \\nthe movie : every element of this movie works . \\nthe costumes and makeup are very memorable , as well as its stunning art direction , and unforgettable scores ( adapted from mozart\\'s original music ) . \\nwhile wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music , milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking . \\nthis movie is a classic that will be remembered for years to come . \\nad2am \" i almost lost my nose . . . and \\ni like it . \\ni like breathing through it . \" \\n-jack nicholson , chinatown \\n',\n"," b'the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done . \\none particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting . \\nunder the \" saluting \" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer . \\nthe salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail . \\nin any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group . \\nalmost at the very beginning of the general\\'s daughter , we see a general\\'s motorcade passing a work detail . \\neveryone salutes . \\nit looked impressive , but it just wasn\\'t right . \\nthat little bit showed me that someone either didn\\'t do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene . \\nin fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie . \\nwhat results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn\\'t right . \\nthe first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example . \\npaul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army\\'s criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale . \\nprior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn\\'t the unscrupulous supply sergeant he\\'s supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living . \\nso ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we\\'ll just say that it involves propellers ) . \\nbrenner then receives new orders when the commanding general\\'s daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base\\'s training ranges . \\nhe is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder . \\nwhat i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary . \\nit gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he\\'s a little cocky . \\ndoes the arms subplot turn up later ? \\nno , so why add this extra running time to the film ? \\nthe answer : it looked cool . \\nor how about the \" atmosphere \" ? \\nthe beginning of the general\\'s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music . \\nnice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn\\'t matter , for when the film\\'s plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood . \\nno attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme . \\ndid the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ? \\ninstead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside . \\nthe above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie . \\nas i\\'ve already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn\\'t jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty . \\nbrenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest \" yes , sir \" s i\\'ve ever heard . \\nhe even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general\\'s daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous . \\nsunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity . \\nboth characters are protagonists , but it\\'s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing . \\ni could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , \" let\\'s do it again , but this time , i want more . \" \\ni say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes . \\nan even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general\\'s aide , colonel fowler . \\ni swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention . \\na far cry from his days as linc in \" the mod squad \" , i can\\'t help but think he was acting from west\\'s direction . \\na couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear . \\nthe only two actors who seem to have escaped west\\'s influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth\\'s mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police . \\nwoods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people\\'s minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top . \\nhutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn\\'t overacting . \\ni haven\\'t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i\\'ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form . \\nthe movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished . \\nevery time we\\'re presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it\\'s the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all . \\ninstead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead . \\nthe army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was . \\nwould\\'ve been over in a half hour . \\nthe film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning . \\nliterally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off . \\nthey both seem kind of happy . \\nmaybe they were driving away from simon west . \\n',\n"," b'being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently . \\nafter all , it\\'s considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago . \\nso one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it . \\ni was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration . \\nbut now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound . \\nafter watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen . \\nbased on the autobiographical writing of british officer t . e . \\nlawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o\\'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever . \\nbored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army . \\nlawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i . \\nshot in panavision\\'s famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic . \\nit is absolutely breathtaking . \\nusing stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes . \\nevery shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land . \\ndavid lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today . \\nafter watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , \" i\\'ve got to do a remake of this film ! \" \\nbut then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive : \" okay , it\\'s going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert . \\nwe are going to need to blow up a full-size train because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice . \\nand we are not going to use any big stars , and won\\'t have any female actors since there\\'s no love story . \" \\nyes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of hollywood a long time ago . \\nbut at least we still have the proof to show all would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be . \\n',\n"," b'this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be \" one of the hottest writers in hollywood \" . \\nhe wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then added the successful i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) \\nscript to his mix , and also created the popular tv series \" dawson\\'s creek \" . \\nso when he asked to direct his first movie , based on his first ever script written , everyone and their grandma said \" sure , go for it ! \" . \\nuhhm , my question is . . . did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ? \\nplot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs . tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college . \\nwhen she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman . \\ncritique : it\\'s not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks . \\nthis movie is chock-full of one-dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles . \\ni was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr . \\nzhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate . \\nhe also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue . \\nsure , katie holmes is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one-dimensional character in any film , holmes\\' rival in the film , mrs . tingle\\'s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long-haired dude , hired to be the poor man\\'s version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man\\'s version of johnny depp ! ) . \\nall in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson\\'s genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend . \\nno hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater . \\nif you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning . \\nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson\\'s father was a fisherman . \\nkevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \\nhe is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv\\'s \" dawson\\'s creek \" , a show kevin created . \\nhe was once an aspiring actor . \\nin fact , he even landed a bit part on tv\\'s \" another world \" . \\nalso , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs . tingle , which is also loosely based on the book \" killing mr . griffin \" by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) , \\nlois duncan . \\nhe has also come out and said that he is a gay man . \\nhelen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff . \\nshe is married to director taylor hackford , whose works include devil\\'s advocate ( 8/10 ) and an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) . \\nthis film was originally titled killing mrs . \\ntingle , but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident . \\nactress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called \" wasteland \" . \\nthis is actor barry watson first full feature film . \\nhe has played the character of \" seth \" on tv\\'s \" malibu shores \" several times . \\n',\n"," b'in my opinion , a movie reviewer\\'s most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion . \\nbut with soul survivors , i\\'m so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned . \\nhowever , protocol forces me to do otherwise . \\nsoul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent . \\nparty girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) . \\nmatt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) . \\ndriving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash . \\nsean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her . \\nas cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him . \\nalong with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party . \\nannabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass\\'s visions . \\nshe has to figure out this purgatory all by herself . \\nrarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material . \\nin his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion . \\nwhen the movie\\'s camerawork isn\\'t pedestrian , it\\'s clich ? d . \\ncarpenter\\'s need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . \\nwe already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? \\nand the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . \\ncarpenter\\'s script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . \\nthis is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . \\nthe second lamest device , of course , is the , \" oh , it was all a dream \" resolution . \\nand guess what ? \\nthis movie has both ! \\nnot that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . \\nsince there\\'s no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . \\nthat\\'s a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . \\ncarpenter can\\'t even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it . \\n[the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats . \\n-ed . ] \\nwhen sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts . \\nand when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they\\'re fully clothed . \\nregardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity . \\nwhy wouldn\\'t they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ? \\nwhy would they shower in their clothes ? \\nwhat if they weren\\'t covered in latex paint ? \\nthe cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes . \\ni felt sorry for affleck , who i\\'ve liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty . \\ndushku , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality , has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan . \\nas for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking . \\nand i\\'m not even getting into luke wilson\\'s role as a priest . \\nat least he\\'s friends with wes anderson . \\nbottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it . \\n',\n"," b'in \" magic town \" , jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a \" perfect \" town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll-takers care about . \\nhowever , as time progresses , and he finds himself falling in love with the town ( and a woman ) , he begins to see that what he\\'s doing is wrong . \\nthe plot is standard stuff , but that\\'s not important . \\nin a film like this , it\\'s the calibre of the actors that make or break it . \\nobviously , since stewart stars , that\\'s practically a non-issue . \\nhe\\'s great in the film , as usual . \\nthere\\'s just something about him that always manages to be endearing , even when he\\'s deceiving the town folk . \\nyou\\'re always on his side , and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition . \\nthe film was directed by a longtime frank capra script-writer , and it shows . \\nthis is the type of feel-good picture that capra is famous for . \\nby the time \" the end \" shows up on screen , everything has been wrapped up very nicely . \\nthere are no loose ends , and virtually every character gets a happy ending ( those that deserve one , anyway ) . \\nin this age of cynicism , it\\'s refreshing to see a movie so upbeat . \\n \" magic town \" is a delightfully entertaining motion picture . \\nif you believe all old movies are slow-paced , you\\'d be well-advised to check this one out . \\n',\n"," b'what is freedom ? \\nhow does one determine who is free ? \\nin 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now . \\nyet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations . \\nthat is , in essence , what steven spielberg\\'s gripping drama \" amistad \" is about . \\nthrough its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard \" la amistad \" . \\non their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew . \\nhowever , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder . \\nin the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away . \\nthe united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back . \\nthe two spaniards who own \" la amistad \" want the slaves for themselves . \\nthe american ship that found the slaves also wants them . \\nin the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free . \\nthey enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them . \\nthrough various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex-president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . \\nthe film itself is a visual wonder . \\nspielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well . \\nat times , the film is very slow , and very methodical . \\nhowever , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag . \\nthe film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified . \\nthe characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman\\'s abolitionist . \\nbut spielberg\\'s finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque\\'s family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning . \\nit is this emotional force that carries the film . \\nmcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans , hopkins is sensational as the old adams , freeman is outstanding when used ( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents ) , and the rest of the cast is stellar . \\nthe movie , however , belongs to hounsou . \\nhis emotional intensity is brilliant . \\nspielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou , and the film\\'s extraordinary power is simply captivating . \\nthe film is flawed , for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard . \\nbut that doesn\\'t matter . \\nthe story is a gripping one , and one of extreme importance . \\nkudos to spielberg for finding it , finding the right men for the job , and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque . \\na good job all around . \\n',\n"," b'let\\'s get this one over with as quickly as possible . \\nif there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming . \\nbut as it is , \" godzilla \" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio . \\nproducer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch \" last year at merienbad \" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot . \\nno amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs . \\ndracula ) . \\n \" godzilla \" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs . \\nwe are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) . \\nwell , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature . \\nlater , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor . \\nin a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word \" gojira \" ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) . \\nwe are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) . \\nhe is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population . \\nhe is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature . \\nin a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica . \\nwell , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york . \\nwhen the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) . \\nthe military , with dr . tatopoulos\\'s help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system . \\nit finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast\\'s picture . \\nthe monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage . \\nworking from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) . \\nwell the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant . \\nneedless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster\\'s nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn\\'t dead yet ) . \\ni sincerely hope that i\\'ve completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film . \\ni gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour\\'s wage on this tripe . \\neverything about \" godzilla \" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast . \\nthe script ( and let\\'s be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years \" razzie \" award . \\nthe dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos\\' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) . \\nthe film could be enjoyably campy if it didn\\'t take itself so damn seriously . \\nbut to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind . \\nno . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it . \\nthe film is bleak and ugly looking . \\ntaking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth . \\neverything is ugly and dark . \\nnew york has never looked so inhospitable since \" death wish \" . \\nin an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue . \\nthe only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr . tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint . \\nthe scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up . \\nyou know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint . \\nfor a scientist , this is very poor observation . \\nlet\\'s look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) : \\n1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ? \\n2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ? \\ni don\\'t think iguana\\'s have a habit of migrating . \\n3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ? \\n4 . ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it\\'s suspension cables . \\n5 . ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ? \\nif so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures . \\n ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide . \\ngodzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) . \\n6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel . \\n7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can\\'t catch you on foot . \\n8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla . \\n9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can\\'t tear through the park avenue tunnel . \\n10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ? \\nmaybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel . \\n11 . ) galapagos iguana\\'s actually live in the french polynesian islands ? \\n12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ? \\n13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ? \\n14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting . \\nnew yorkers hate beta cam . \\ni could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is . \\ndon\\'t be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of \" america\\'s funniest home videos \" . \\nthe performances in the film are singularly bland . \\nnot one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror . \\nthe characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices . \\nthe only common occurrence that doesn\\'t take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable . \\ngodzilla for the most part is okay . \\nthe design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable . \\none thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath . \\nnow , i for one can\\'t quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait . \\na good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly . \\nthere is so much wrong with this film that i can\\'t really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) . \\nany film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac . \\nthe addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of \\'jurassic park \" , but with none of that film\\'s suspense or tension . \\nsuffice to say that , \" godzilla \" is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade . \\nthis is a film that needed the hype . \\nwith the current level of writing and directing , nothing else about the film succeeds . \\nif you\\'ve seen the trailers , you\\'ve seen the best parts . \\nmy only suggestion for mr . d and mr . e . is that they could always go back to selling shoes . \\n . this film could be the next \" rocky horror \" . \\nonly it\\'s not funny ! \\n',\n"," b'a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . \\nfamily breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail . \\nstill , i can\\'t recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . \\nand after it , i still can\\'t . \\nbye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare . \\nonly a few moments which have nothing to do with the film\\'s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . \\nbye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children . \\ndave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) . \\nover the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic\\'s blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny\\'s growing estrangement from emma . \\nthe three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . \\nrandy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . \\nhis run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible . \\nhe does get bye bye love\\'s best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . \\npaul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy \" mad about you \" persona , but he does it well . \\nas a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . \\nmatthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . \\nthis isn\\'t a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . \\nmodine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it\\'s all his father\\'s fault he\\'s such a cad . \\ncarolco\\'s executives , whose entire future is resting on modine\\'s bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now . \\nbye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another \" dating in the 90s \" movie . \\nwhen the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . \\neven more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald\\'s and befriends a troubled youth . \\nit is a sad end to flanders\\' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald\\'s as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . \\neven if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children . \\nany way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . \\nit is left to the dads\\' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn\\'t enough . \\nthere have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . \\nbye bye love is a genuine shame . \\n',\n"," b\"i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults . \\nthe last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating . \\nhowever , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away . \\nboth films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers . \\neven better , i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts . \\neveryone loves surprises . \\nu-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets . \\nthis may be true , but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience's socks off . \\nset during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats , u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship . \\nthere's only one problem : the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as ( you guessed it ) u-571 . \\nit is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors , led by an interim captain named tyler ( matthew mcconaughey ) , to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships . \\nthe film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors ( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear ) . \\nonce the crew gets on the u-boat , the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down . \\nas soon as the action starts , it does not stop and luckily , because it is so exciting , i didn't want it to stop . \\nthis is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises , from the wonderful , heart-pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men , make sure you see this at a theater with surround-sound ? otherwise , do not see it all . \\nthe best parts of u-571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations . \\nthroughout the movie , several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler's job as stressful as possible . \\ngermans gun down their own men , tyler's mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory , another sailor ( erik palladino ) threatens mutiny . \\nall of these examples , and several others , increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler's every move . \\nthey also make u-571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while . \\n\",\n"," b'weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg\\'s reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . \\nthere ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . \\nspielberg\\'s greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . \\nbut for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . \\nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . \\n_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a \" pr mission \" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . \\nryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . \\nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . \\nthere\\'s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . \\nthe equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . \\nthe opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . \\nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg\\'s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . \\nthe technical side of the film is peerless , as always . \\nthe camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . \\nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . \\nyet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . \\nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . \\nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . \\nfor example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . \\nhere and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there\\'s an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . \\nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . \\nthere are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . \\nthe relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . \\nultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . \\nrather than saying _saving private ryan_ is \" realistic , \" it would be better to describe it as \" having realistic moments . \" \\nanother aspect of the \" hollywoodization \" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . \\nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell\\'s superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . \\n \" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? \" \\nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight . \\nrendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as \" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? \" \\nor some variant thereof . \\nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the \" f \" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . \\nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an \" r \" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . \\nhowever , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . \\nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . \\nhe cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . \\nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler\\'s list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler\\'s monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller\\'s last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . \\nthat particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . \\nnowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . \\nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows . \\n . \\n',\n"," b'where do i begin ? \\nokay , how about with this : starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time . \\nin fact , it might even be the

\\nwell , no . \\ntroopers has about four or five lines of dialouge/short humorous scenes that are actually funny , mostly from the \" do you want to know more ? \" \\ncommercials that pop up

inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen . \\nthat is not to say that i don\\'t like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these

very tight clothing and realize they\\'ve walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand . \\ncomments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here , but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series \" party of five . \" \\ni am only vaguely aware of the show\\'s premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube . \\n \" party of five , \" i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre . \\nneve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show . \\nso too is jennifer love hewitt . \\nlo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line . \\nthough the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater\\'s glowing red exit sign longingly throughout . \\njennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting . \\nshe just isn\\'t convincing in this film ( and she wasn\\'t in the original either ) . \\nthis puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she\\'s very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure . \\nadd to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience . \\ni\\'ve spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason . \\ni still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses . \\nnothing else here is original or interesting . \\nthis movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter\\'s vampires seem like stunning works of high art . \\ni still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc . you get the picture . \\nthe entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer\\'s hook . \\nthey may as well have huge targets painted on them . \\nlike scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief . \\nunfortunately , i still know\\'s characters aren\\'t all that funny . \\nin particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn\\'t die soon enough . \\nthe death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film . \\nseveral of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie . \\nthis , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for . \\nand what is the deal with the slasher himself ? \\ni know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror . \\ncome on , the guy looks like the gorton\\'s fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate . \\nthough his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that\\'s * really * saying something . \\nso , all that\\'s left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy . \\nboth prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene . \\nhewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite . \\n . \\n . titillating . \\nthis scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system . \\notherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves . \\nearly in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas . \\nshe and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever . \\ni needed extra-strength tylenol after that part . \\noh , and the film\\'s conclusion , talk about repetitive ! \\npeople who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know\\'s ending at least 5 minutes before it happens . \\nboring ! \\ni saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater . \\nadmission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them . \\nit\\'s usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don\\'t seem to mind participating in a mass \" mystery science theater 3000 \" -type viewing . \\ni still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is . \\nif it weren\\'t for the main actresses\\' revealing wardrobes , i\\'d have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel . \\ni can\\'t imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn\\'t recommend it to people , unless they\\'re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy . \\ni read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works . \\nwhat a depressing thought . \\nhewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act . \\nrated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted . \\ni\\'d say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn\\'t have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film\\'s target audience . \\n',\n"," b\"billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment . \\nas jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers . \\nthree men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane

, though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan . \\ndisaster is sure to strike . \\ndirector sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name . \\nwhile there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come . \\nscott b . smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension . \\nwhile it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter . \\nalar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character . \\ndanny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score . \\nif there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long . \\njust when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further . \\nwhile this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) . \\nthe performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife . \\nthis is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films . \\nfingers crossed , though , that this doesn't stop him from making another evil dead sequel . \\n\",\n"," b'in a typical cinematic high school , the football jocks have

\\ni was almost stunned by the quality of \" who framed roger rabbit ? \" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together . \\n \" the little mermaid \" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century . \\nhowever , the endless stream of \" the little mermaid \" wanna-be\\'s is getting to me . \\nyou know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well-known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick/sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in-jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner-brothers-coyote-fall-off-the-cliff type joke . \\nit\\'s a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome . \\nthat\\'s why i\\'m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio . \\nfrom what i\\'ve seen of their movies ( \" kiki\\'s delivery service \" and the already english-dubbed and american- distributed \" my neighbor totoro \" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat . \\nthese movies , particularly \" kiki\\'s delivery service , \" are wonderfully original and entertaining . \\n \" kiki\\'s delivery service \" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home . \\nthis is unusual because kiki isn\\'t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch . \\nher mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance . \\njust the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki\\'s mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom . \\nkiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to . \\ninitially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she\\'s discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch . \\non the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it . \\nthe favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one-persons delivery service . \\nthis is where the movie becomes shockingly good . \\nkiki\\'s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her . \\nthe townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn\\'t seem forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light . \\nthey\\'re three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl . \\nhowever , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique . \\nthe personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950\\'s . \\nthis beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at . \\ni could probably go on all day , but i won\\'t ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . \\nsome of my favorites are kiki\\'s relationship with the baker\\'s husband : although he\\'s quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship . \\nin the garage of a deliveree\\'s house can be found a vintage model t . two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master-servant to friend-friend . \\nsuch details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg . \\nadded on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self-worth . \\nkiki initially seems to derive much of her self-worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty . \\nthis causes kiki to lose faith in herself . \\nhowever , kiki comes to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her . \\nseeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don\\'t even want to hint at it . \\nthe ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i\\'ve ever seen ; if you don\\'t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention . \\nthe movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki\\'s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes . \\nhowever , i would be surprised if disney doesn\\'t give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian . \\nrefreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into . \\n \" beauty and the beast \" \\'s beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person\\'s inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing . \\nkiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film . \\nanother difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for \" kiki\\'s delivery service \" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki\\'s flights . \\nthe extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i\\'ve ever seen . \\ni\\'m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united states . \\ndisney tentatively plans a theater release of \" monoko hime \" shortly following the summer \\'97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . \\ni\\'d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no competing disney release . \\nalthough the wait is unfortunate , it\\'s good to know that it\\'s being released at all , for \" kiki\\'s delivery service \" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . \\nwatch this movie . \\nalong with \" man bites dog , \" and perhaps something by woody allen

dysfunctional , telefixated limbo , loud quirky stranger denise calls up martin to announce that she is pregnant with his child , courtesy of the sperm he donated to the local bank . \\nas martin progresses from slamming the phone on her to long phone conversations over the baby's name , his friends - and his friends' friends - get involved , courtesy of call-waiting and double-lines . \\nin the tigher and more tantalizing sub-plot , barbara and jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for . \\nboth profess to have too complicated schedules to ever meet , but they get it going over the phone . \\nwith repeated phone sex comes a glitch ; what if the other person is simply faking it ? \\ndenise calls up scores with some inspired moments . \\nmousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless , everyone shares the excitement of denise's delivery through a conference call to her handphone , and barbara's best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friend's answering machine . \\n ( as gale's overly-chatty aunt recounts , her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain . ) \\nbut these moments are not enough to sustain the movie . \\nthe pace sags , the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephone-touters . \\nand the ending is literally a non-event as expected , everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gale's memory despite promising over the phone that they will . \\nwe get the point . \\nthe movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly-'90s statement until they have it coming out of your ears . \\npun intended . \\nthere's even a on the movie's web site where you can win cellular phones ( as if we haven't had enough of these things already ) . \\nwatch the movie only if you find it philosophy compelling enough for a earful . \\nthe flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but

something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non-horror movies . \\noh yeah , there\\'s also something about a ghost possessing the mansion

aren\\'t as pronounced this time around , the energy level , the gags and all of the characters just seem to be going through the motions here . \\nit\\'s like they were all in a hurry to finish the film or something ( wink , wink ) . \\nand the scariest part of it all ? \\ncheck out the number of screenwriters it took to pen this puppy : seven ! \\ni say again , it took seven people to write 82-minutes worth of fart jokes , half-assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror . \\nnow i\\'m not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed \" funny sketch \" ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves , but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on \" saturday night live \" . \\nthere are a couple of funny one-liners , but mostly just rehashed one-joke scenes , a lot of dead silence and lame gags . \\nadd to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here ( the film\\'s website isn\\'t even up yet ! ! ! \\nwhat the f * * * ? ! ? ) . \\ni do however have to give it up to james woods , the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all ( the exorcist take-off-- miss this and you\\'ve missed any reason to see the flick ) . \\ni especially liked his one-liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman\\'s head turning . \\nvery funny ! \\nunfortunately , the film plummets straight down after that , with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude , where\\'s my car , and other action movies like charlie\\'s angels and mission impossible 2 . now help me figure this one out , will you ? \\nisn\\'t this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies ? ! ? \\n ( or maybe that\\'s just the title of the film f-ing with my head ) . \\nwell , i\\'m sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame-ass script ! \\nthe wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers ( money ) instead of the zucker brothers ( comedy ) for this sequel . \\nunfortunately for us , all we\\'re left with here is a skeleton of a film which might\\'ve been funny , had it been worked over a few more times , tightened up here and there , and been injected with more solid laughs . \\nbut as things stand now , there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year\\'s film has led everyone down this path , so screw them for not trying as hard ( critically speaking , of course ) . \\nyou should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough \" real \" effort into this chop-job and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents .

and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script . \\nunfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes . \\nthe residents of mystery love hockey . \\nmystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football . \\nthe townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who\\'s guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that\\'s one of the movie\\'s jokes . ) \\nevery saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch . \\nthe town\\'s prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated . \\nmystery\\'s national fame has the town abuzz . \\na week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl . \\nthe new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals . \\nthe mysterians see this as both good and bad . \\non the one hand , they\\'d love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition . \\non the other hand , they don\\'t want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes . \\nthe movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition . \\nbiebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement . \\nhe\\'s already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife . \\ncrowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he\\'s just kind of stuck with constantly brooding . \\ncharlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man\\'s worth . \\nhis \" gift \" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater . \\nhe hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him . \\nburt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans . \\nwalter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him . \\nhe wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it . \\nreynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together . \\none character actually was interesting . \\nbiebe\\'s wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey . \\nbut unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community . \\nshe chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open . \\nher unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom . \\nmysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning . \\nthe biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about . \\ninstead , roach and screenwriters david e . kelley and sean o\\'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy . \\nthey try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride . \\nthey present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there\\'s nothing truly funny . \\nthey show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about . \\nas columnist molly ivins would say , it\\'s all hat , no cattle . \\nthe perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about . \\nthere is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music . \\nit is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what\\'s truly important . \\nrussell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie\\'s metaphor for us . \\nhe says that what really matters in life is \" community . . . . \" \\nthen adds \" and hockey . \" \\ni guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear . \\nonly mildly bad , mystery , alaska probably deserves 2 stars . \\ni even laughed out loud , genuine laughs in places . \\nbut i docked it an extra half star when mike myers , a friend of roach , turned up in a role that didn\\'t suit him . \\nmyers is a comic character actor . \\nhe puts on masks , becomes an outrageous caricature , and is funny . \\nhe\\'s great as austin powers , dr . evil , or any of his scottish characters . \\nnobody else in mysterty , alaska is a comic caricature . \\nall the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles . \\nfor roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast , toward his audience , and indeed toward the film itself . \\nit\\'s an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously . \\n',\n"," b'the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates . \\ngeez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this ! \\nsorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies . \\nthe pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in \" absolutely fabulous \" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery . \\nneedless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder\\'s legs ! \\nbut despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i\\'ve now seen the film a couple of times now , that \" hobbling \" scene was no less disturbing ! \\ni\\'m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion ! \\nthat may be the most memorable scene , but it\\'s certainly not the only worth watching . \\nstephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale . \\nit\\'s a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) . \\nrescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer\\'s \" number one fan \" , he soon becomes her prisoner . \\nboth the script and kathy bates\\' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) . \\nbates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece . \\nat times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she\\'s a rather tragic character , and more often than not she\\'s just damned scary ! \\nthis is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity . \\nit\\'s an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it\\'s basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it\\'s a remarkable piece of cinema . \\nthere are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner\\'s stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan . \\noh , i haven\\'t really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who\\'s a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) . \\nbut , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show . \\nalong with the pig , of course ! \\nanyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense . \\nthere\\'s the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine . \\nhe succeeds , but . . . she \\nknocks the glass over ! \\ni bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well ! \\nin the immortal words of homer j . simpson - \" d\\'oh ! ! \" \\nother nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house . \\nwe cut to annie in her car - she\\'s on her way home . . . he \\nrealises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut \\nto the car again , she\\'s getting near . . . will he make it ? \\nok , so these sequences aren\\'t exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work ! \\nboy , do they work ! \\nif a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it\\'s doing something right ! \\nof course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned \" hobbling \" ! \\nannie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she\\'s going to stop him once and for all . \\ncue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it ! \\nnasty . \\nit all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho ! \\nand then we\\'re given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i\\'ve ever seen . \\nshe gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won\\'t die ! \\nsheldon isn\\'t in terribly good shape either . \\nif it weren\\'t so gorey it would almost be laughable . \\nbut it\\'s a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked . \\nmisery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller . \\nthe directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem . \\nwonderful stuff . \\n ? - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - for more regularly-updated film and tv

they never would have met . \" \\nin a perfect world , i never would have seen this movie . \\nthe biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two-hours-and-then-some production . \\ndutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department . \\nkay is a congresswoman from new hampshire . \\nalthough they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs . \\ndutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair . \\nthe rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often-times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process . \\ntwo sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film . \\ndutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare . \\nall the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter . \\nkay\\'s distraction from the film\\'s primary focus is her campaign for re-election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal . \\nthese sub plots could have made for semi-interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother-daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers . \\nrandom hearts\\' two primary characters seem to live in shells . \\nalthough both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other . \\nthere is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships . \\nveteran actor and director of this film sydney pollack , and critically acclaimed up-and-comer dylan baker both have cameo roles , but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both . \\nother than its weak plot , it is hard to criticize random hearts . \\nhowever , it is also hard to compliment it . \\nhad the film taken some small risks and more fully explored its extra characters and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake , rather than the dry one that equates to be . \\n',\n"," b'i still can\\'t figure out why people went in droves to see this movie . \\nnow before you go assuming i\\'m some sort of high brow snob , who can\\'t appreciate a little dumb humor , let me say that i love cheap humor . \\ni thought there\\'s something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 . \\nlow brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no humor component . \\ni wanted to like the waterboy , i really did . \\ni think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie . \\nactually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that . \\nnot a great record for a 90-minute film . \\nthe problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies . \\nthose responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material . \\nnothing could be further from the truth , as matter of fact , sandler\\'s idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film . \\nit\\'s really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny . \\ni personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it\\'s just that so far he hasn\\'t been able to find the right film to showcase his talents . \\nif his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live . \\nmost of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry . \\nsandler plays a 31-year-old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team . \\nthe team\\'s somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field . \\nyou can figure out the rest from here . \\nsandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star . \\nas i said , the film had a great deal of potential . \\nthe idea was a decent one , but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast . \\nall of whom are very good , just hamstrung by really , really , lousy material . \\neven sandler , annoying goofy voice and all , has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material . \\neven as unfunny as his character is , i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film . \\nbut it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about . \\nif their material had been just a bit better , this film could have been such a funny movie . \\nfairuza balk plays sandler\\'s leather-wearing biker-chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time . \\nwinkler is great as the coach who uses a \" coaching for dummies \" -style book to help him get through games . \\nthe real standout though , is kathy bates . \\neven with some of the worst material of her career to deal with , she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler\\'s overprotective and overbearing mama . \\neven with the performances of bates and winkler , there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie . \\nalthough i get the distinct impression that without them , this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me . \\nwhich is sad , because i can\\'t really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became . \\nit\\'s obvious that those involved , specifically the actors , tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie . \\nit\\'s just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat . \\n',\n"," b'after 1993\\'s \" falling down , \" i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director . \\nsince then he has offered us two so-so adaptations of john grisham novels ( \" the client \" and \" a time to kill \" ) and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise . \\nalthough these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher\\'s potential , the publicity for his latest release , \" 8mm , \" raised new hope . \\nit promised to be something unusual . \\nit wasn\\'t . \\nthe plot goes like this : tom welles ( nicolas cage ) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman , allegorically named mrs . christian ( myra carter ) , to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband\\'s belongings . \\nthe movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask ( who reminds me of bane in schumacher\\'s \" batman & robin \" ) . \\nbecause murders can be realistically simulated in movies , mrs . christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead . \\nby combing through missing persons reports , tom finds the girl\\'s name and tracks her to los angeles . \\nwith the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and another symbolic name ) , tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff . \\nthe plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader\\'s \" hardcore , \" in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter . \\nboth films are modeled on dante\\'s \" the inferno , \" of course ; \" 8mm \" makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil . \\n \" hardcore \" is a much more subtle and meaningful film . \\n \" 8mm \" had a lot of promise . \\nin its better moments it\\'s an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom . \\none moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he\\'s reading truman capote\\'s \" in cold blood \" underneath the cover of a porn novel . \\n \" in cold blood \" was the father of the true-crime genre , which is the literary equivalent of snuff films . \\nmax promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom , \" dance with the devil and the devil don\\'t change ; the devil changes you . \" \\ntom does change-i\\'ll let you discover the specifics for yourself-but not permanently . \\nschumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn\\'t have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn\\'t come back . \\n ( walker\\'s \" seven \" did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise ) . \\ncage tries hard to pull it off , but the script doesn\\'t give him enough to work with . \\nphoenix walks away with the movie-he\\'s smart , charming , and funny . \\nother cast members include \" fargo \" \\'s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and \" the sopranos \" \\'s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far . \\nin the last analysis , since \" 8mm \" falls short of its pretensions and its promise , its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler/ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege . \\nhowever , unlike other predictable fare in the genre-last year\\'s \" twilight , \" for example- \" 8mm \" is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is . \\n',\n"," b'let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years . \\ni am not too fond of ted turner\\'s world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight . \\nthe plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show . \\nwhen they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt . \\ni personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back . \\nwhen they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king\\'s real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv . \\nking is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king . \\nafter convincing king that they don\\'t care that his persona isn\\'t real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw\\'s pay-per-view . \\ngee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don\\'t know where to begin . \\nyes , i do . . . \\n1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans . \\nhe thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously . \\nhe actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously . \\ni got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 ! \\ni know he\\'ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn\\'t meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that\\'s how big an ego bischoff has . \\n2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon\\'s screwing bret \" the hitman \" hart out of the title . \\nthis movie\\'s storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man\\'s wayne and garth thrown in . \\neric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart . \\n3 . \\nthe movie\\'s main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him . \\nno wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today ! \\n4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ? \\ni know wrestling isn\\'t a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end . \\n5 . \\nin the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan . \\nwhat she sees in that freak marilyn manson i\\'ll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king\\'s trainer for sinclair . \\nwouldn\\'t it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ? \\ni hate that . \\n6 . \\nlast , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either . \\nthe world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons : \\n1 . they\\'re the better promotion . \\n2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers . \\n3 . \\nthey give their fans what they want and don\\'t treat them like idiots . \\n4 . they\\'re winning the ratings and they\\'re the promotion everybody cares about . \\n5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way . \\nthe only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end . \\nand if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars . \\n',\n"," b\"stallone attempts to 'act' in this cop drama . \\nthe film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal , who's nephew ( played by michael rappaport ) is involved in a car crash and killing of two black youths . \\nkeital dosen't really want to get involved in anything , gets rid of rappaport , and stallone and de niro try to work out what the hell is going on . \\nthis film should be brilliant . \\nit sounds like a great plot , the actors are first grade , and the supporting cast is good aswell , and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance . \\nhowever , it can't hold up . \\nalthough the acting is fantastic ( even stallone isn't bad ) the directing and story is dull and long winded \\nsome scenes go on for too long , with nothing really happening in them . \\nin fact , the only scenes that do work are action scenes , which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid . \\nin this film , serious means dull . \\nthe dialogue is warbling , and basically just repeats the same points over and over , no matter who is delivering them . \\nthe plot , which has potential , is wasted , again just being cliched after a while . \\nin fact , the only thing that does keep the film going is kietal and de niro , both delivering their usual good performances . \\nhowever , stallone , although not given much to say , gives a good performance . \\nhowever , it's not all that bad . \\nas said above , the action scenes are well done . \\ntheres also a very good ending , which uses the cinemas sound system well . \\nin fact , the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997 . \\nif only the rest of the film was as good as the ending . \\ncop land , then , turns out not to be a power house film , but a rather dull , and not every exciting film . \\nhugely disappointing , and i can't really recommend it . \\n\",\n"," b'i rented this movie with very high hopes . \\nthis movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and

sister perfectly . \\nwith a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast . \\ntobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability . \\nwilliam h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a \" colored \" person and his friends , the \" non-colored \" ones . \\nhe also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife . \\nhe does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood . \\njoan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom . \\nher character is the most ambitious . \\nshe is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that . \\nher lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better . \\nas said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance . \\nhis character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction . \\nhis character is very confusing and he is not very believable . \\nthis film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance . \\nthe movie is very provocative . \\nit challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today . \\ni really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing . \\nthey demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace . \\nthe only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length . \\nsome films are not meant to be that long . \\npleasantville is one of those films . \\nthis film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it . \\nfirst , they are amazed by the implementation of color . \\nthen they want to have it . \\nthen they do not want to . \\nthen the war ensues between the colored and non-colored . \\nthis is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long . \\nsome movies need a lot of time . \\nsaving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time . \\nthis film is only two hours long , and seems much longer . \\nlength is everything in films . \\nif you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle . \\npleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough . \\noverall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days . \\ni went in expecting a light-hearted film about change . \\ni left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change . \\nluckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences . \\nonly if it could have done in a shorter amount of time . \\n',\n"," b'the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it\\'s sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year\\'s finest films . \\nso , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled . \\nit is a rare thing for a children\\'s movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn\\'t you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly \" magical \" piece of work ? \\na tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film . \\nlooking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater . \\nbelieve me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city . \\nthe plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon . \\nbut after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially . \\nthe only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) . \\nproblem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded \" city \" , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion . \\nsetting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels . \\nit is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright . \\nhere is where the film took a wrong turn . \\nup until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience . \\nthe beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs . \\nunfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe . \\nthe main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is . \\nat one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown . \\nat other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget\\'s full cavity search at the airport . \\nin fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing . \\nhowever , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway . \\nthe animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child . \\nanother problem i found with the film was it\\'s sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story . \\nif you\\'re going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine . \\nit may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition . \\nbut to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ? \\nit just didn\\'t feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie . \\n',\n"," b'a big , busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch , the great white hype stars samuel l . jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay-per-view revenues is to \" invent \" a white contender ( peter berg ) to challenge his black heavyweight \" champ \" ( damon wayans ) . \\n ( the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs . white than black vs . black . ) \\nhe may be right , in an absurdly accurate way , but the film doesn\\'t give us a reason to care . \\nas a scathing sports spoof , hype is just that : unfunny , unfocused , and , at times , just plain pointless . \\nas a commentary on race relations , it\\'s even * less * effective . \\nthe dialogue is the best of this mess , lines like jon lovitz exclaiming \" i cannot make caviar out of fish eggs ! \" \\nwriters tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang , though we never hear enough of it . \\nthe script isn\\'t strong enough , though , to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin ( house party ) . \\nhe comes across as absolute overkill . \\nthe great white hype * almost * turns around at the end , at the big match , when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock-concert proportions . \\nwith costumed dwarfs , gangsta rappers , and the \" champ \" dressed as death , only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that should\\'ve been . \\n',\n"," b'bob the happy bastard\\'s quickie review : \\ni must admit , no doubt\\'s single \" new \" is quite catchy . \\nit was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . \\nthe result ? \\na movie that\\'s just as good as that song , really . \\nit follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . \\nfirst we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he\\'s been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop\\'s strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . \\nreally , it\\'s all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . \\nthe movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . \\nthe dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . \\nthink of it as a , well , ending . \\nthe intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it\\'s never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . \\nhowever , it\\'s better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn\\'t . \\n',\n"," b\"this was the last carry on movie ( if you discount 'carry on columbus' as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company . \\nbased in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) . \\nwhen he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador . \\nher antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages . \\nshe is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead . \\nmeanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her . \\nhowever , she is only interested in restoring her husband's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile's accident with a church spire ! \\nthis film is the second worst carry on movie , the worst being 'carry on england' . \\nit is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written . \\nnewcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny , but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad . \\nkenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script . \\nthe small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs . dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are worthless and embarassing . \\nin fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements . \\nhowever , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades . \\nan awful script , a terrible collection of jokes , very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace ) , a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score , and a non-existent plot or storyline . \\nits just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next ! \\njack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring , joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted , and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile . \\na complete waste of time , this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies . \\nit was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 , there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 ! \\navoid at all costs ! \\n\",\n"," b'please don\\'t mind this windbag letting off a bit of steam . . . i \\njust want to warn all of y\\'all not to waste your hard-earned $$$ on anaconda . \\nit\\'s not even worth a 99-cent video rental . \\ndon\\'t listen to ebert on this one ( he has no clue what he\\'s talking about ! ) \\nbtw i accompanied my friend to this one because she was * required * to watch it on assignment ( she reviews movies for a local paper ) . \\nnow i\\'ll actually back up my huffing and puffing . \\nhere goes : \\nmovie : anaconda rydain\\'s bottom line : wait for it to come on usa up all night . \\neven then , i doubt it\\'s worth the price of jolt ( to help you stay up that late ! ) \\nwhy do i hate anaconda ? \\nlet me count the ways . . . \\nfirst of all , this movie gets way too many snake facts wrong . \\nas an ophiophile ( snake lover ) , i can tell you that a ) anacondas would never reach a length of 40 feet , b ) they\\'re scared of people , c ) cases of snakes eating adult humans are extremely rare because human shoulders are too wide to fit in a snake\\'s mouth , and constrictor snakes don\\'t kill what they can\\'t eat , d ) people can outrun snakes with no trouble , especially heavy ones like anacondas , e ) if an anaconda did eat a human , it would need at least 6 months of sitting on its butt to digest the huge meal , therefore it couldn\\'t run around gobbling up everybody else in the cast , and f ) snakes have no vocal cords , so they can\\'t make funny squealing noises . \\nwhew . \\ni was prepared to suspend reality if the movie would have been worth it . \\nunfortunately , anaconda was about as suspenseful and exciting as watching paint peel . \\nmy friend and i even successfully predicted who would live at the end . \\nanybody can tell the bad guy is going to die eventually . \\nthat was a pity because his character was one of the few reasons my friend and i didn\\'t give up and fall asleep . \\nhe was the most likable character in the movie . \\nwho wouldn\\'t enjoy somebody who looks like a deranged walt whitman ? \\nanaconda did have its cute moments : arguments between ice cube\\'s character and the british guy , for instance . \\nhowever , those small flashes of wit were not worth the other hour and twenty-eight minutes of boring schlock . \\nthe writers had - and blew - a multitude of opportunities to insert funny lines . \\ni was quite disappointed with a scene where a young guy tells a young lady that the jungle makes him horny . \\ndid she retort with a clever , ego-withering comeback ? \\nof course not ! \\n \" i\\'m trying to work ! \" \\ngee , that\\'s even dumber than the crap comebacks i come up with . \\nshe could have told him to go find a knothole or something . . . \\n ; p but i will admit , there was just one scene where i was surprised at the outcome ( hint : it involves the evil guy and miss crap comebacks ) . \\nas for the plot , i\\'m still trying to find one . \\nthis movie was basically an excuse to get a boatload of people into dangerous territory where they could get snarfed by ridiculous , computer-generated anacondas with the eyes and fangs of vipers and the faster-than-gravity downward acceleration of a harrier jet . \\n ( harrier snake ? ) \\nnot to mention instant digestion so they could go snarf countless other victims . \\nthe writers tried to throw in some sort of plot twist ( should i call it a plot knot because it made no sense ? ) in which the sick guy\\'s g-friend kisses the evil dude and suddenly everybody hates said evil dude and starts trying to kill him . \\nthat was about as clear and understandable as mission : impossible . \\n ( if someone could explain that movie to me , i\\'d be most grateful ! \\nall the old-guy double agents looked the same ! ! ) \\ni wasn\\'t inspired by the acting , save for the evil dude . \\ni can\\'t blame the actors , though . \\nit\\'s not their fault they had a cruddy script to work with . \\nthis concludes

fills it with sub-road trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it because he\\'s just oh-so-ironic . \\nbut when a movie is so self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself , we can hardly be expected to pay for admission . \\njay and silent bob , two new jersey stoners who hang out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot , have appeared in almost all of smith\\'s movies but , if i\\'m not mistaken , have not starred in one until now . \\nthey find out that there is a movie based on the comic book that is based on them being made in hollywood . \\nthis presents two problems : a ) they haven\\'t received a penny in royalties and b ) nerds on the internet ( \" what\\'s the internet ? \" ) \\nare talking trash about them . \\nwhat is there to do except go to hollywood and stop this movie from being made ? \\non the way -- they\\'re hitchhiking , because who knew you needed tickets to take a bus ? \\n-- they run into a group of hotties who pretend to be with an animal-rights group , but are really jewel thiefs who parade around in charlie\\'s angels-style outfits . \\nof course , they set jay and silent bob up to look like the thieves , so that there is a massive manhunt going on during the second half of the film . \\nwill ferrell , who again proves himself incapable of doing anything but sketch comedy , shows up as the wildlife marshal inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey . \\nthe movie will probably please only smith\\'s die-hard , undiscerning fans ; everyone else will be critical of this mind-bogglingly stupid effort following some the sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years past . \\nany appeal the movie has will come from the \" in \" jokes , most of which i think i understood , but the movie is \" in \" to the

( though i agree that his films would be better off if he\\'d let a real director take the helm ) , and jay and silent bob strike back holds true to his promise to make a more facetious film . \\nunfortunately , it\\'s also shapeless , pointless and largely unfunny . \\nsmith\\'s \" verbal trampoline , \" as ben affleck once called his distinctive dialogue , takes a back seat to his dubious instincts as a populist filmmaker . \\nthis was supposed to be the movie that didn\\'t offend anyone , but it\\'s offensive because it\\'s terrible . \\n',\n"," b'film adaptation of hunter s . thompson\\'s infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title . \\ndirector terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) \\n \" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie \" , according to gilliam . \\nplot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . \\nduring their trip , they systematically consume \" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . \\nthe movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . \\ncritique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer\\'s own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . \\nif you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . \\nif , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture\\'s entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . \\nnote : i have not read thompson\\'s book . \\nhaving said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . \\nthis movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . \\nit moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . \\nit was 1971 , and the times were apparently \" a\\' changing \" in the states . \\njohnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . \\nduring the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . \\ni thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . \\nthe one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . \\ni couldn\\'t believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) . \\nword on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . \\nplenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . \\nother than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed . \\nthis movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . \\nand for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . \\nlittle known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . \\nbill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam . \\njohnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what\\'s eating gilbert grape ? \\n ( 7/10 ) . \\nin 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he\\'d tried every drug by the age of 14 . \\njohnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now . \\njohnny was born in kentucky , is a high-school dropout , has nicknamed himself \" mr . stench \" ,

with \" . . . this is the fake news , \" norm macdonald , at times , could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi-offensive phrases in his raspy voice , coated with a condescending attitude . \\nhis shtick was marked by crassness . \\nin this movie , for example , when his girlfriend says that she\\'s kicking him out because he\\'s been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months , he tries to calm the situation by saying , \" maybe you\\'ll feel better after we have some dirty sex . \" \\nthis kind of humor can only go so far , but certainly can\\'t go the distance in a full-length feature . \\n \" dirty work \" , is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically . \\nemotionally , they\\'ve never outgrown their pubescent years , which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback . \\nalthough having no apparent real world skills , the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people . \\nif the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket , then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart . \\nmitch ( norm macdonald ) and

is established , but when a less-than-honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment , the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge . \\nby default , dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots , but it delivers jerky boys level material . \\nexcept for the bit at the used car lot ( and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers ) , the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call . \\nalready weak on material , it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs \\'broads\\' and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction . \\nbut what\\'s really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor . \\nrelying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying \" note to self \" ( \" note to self : learn to fight , \" he says after getting beat up ; \" note to self : there\\'s always beer , \" he says after hitting rock bottom ; etc . ) , we feel like we\\'re just watching an elongated rehash of his not-so-glorious

of his role in the mask 2 . the film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip-off of dante\\'s inferno mixed with an old stephen j . cannell television pilot . \\nthe pace of the film is jarring and

off the debt . \\nthat \" rounders \" \\' story quickly molds itself into a conventional , predictable tale of redemption doesn\\'t hinder its potency . \\ndirector john dahl , infamous for his neo-noirs \" red rock west \" and \" the last seduction , \" gets extremely convincing mileage out of the been-there , done-that plot mechanics by trumping up the relationship between mike and worm . \\ndamon and norton bring so much to their roles that they\\'d be worth catching even if \" rounders \" ultimately folded , but the movie ups its fascinating ante by contrasting their wildly different ways of winning . \\nany sequence where the two men sit at the table together is an unarguable highlight . \\nif only the other character interaction was as successful , \" rounders \" might merit consideration when it comes time to number the year\\'s best films . \\ncurrent \" it girl \" gretchen mol is sweetly appealing as mike\\'s girlfriend jo , aware and weary of his seedy past , but her scenes with damon number too few to be very effective . \\njohn turturro\\'s aging mentor and famke janssen\\'s tempting siren , both interesting sketches , are hampered by the same limited screen time . \\nand as a wizened judge , the great martin landau makes memorable a role that\\'s mostly a plot device - he\\'s on hand mostly to sort-of save the day and provide a voice for \" rounders \" \\' moral . \\nthat moral , by the way , is \" our destiny chooses us , \" and it\\'s something of a surprise when \" rounders \" supports this solemn proverb by eschewing the conclusion you might expect ; mike does learn from his mistake , but neither the mistake nor the way he learns from it is what it initially appears to be . \\nin the end , \" rounders \" sees gambling as less a mere addiction than a potential art form , but the poker itself is only a metaphor for a much larger picture . \\nthe road to true fulfillment lies within the realization and exercising of your natural passions , the movie espouses , no matter what they might be . \\nhere , low-rent lowlifes like worm just aren\\'t cut out for the cards . \\nscreenwriters david levien and brian koppelman entertain and educate in their quest to vividly render a culture that\\'s often generalized by movies ; even complete poker neophytes should cross the line from observers to participants when the movie gets to its concluding game scene . \\ninside every adventurous filmgoer , there is a desire to be taken someplace new and exciting , and that\\'s the precise allure of \" rounders . \" \\nit ultimately matters not that a few of our tour guides feel partially-realized or that the journey itself is cluttered with sites we\\'ve seen before , because the final destination is a satisfying one . \\nin the end , \" rounders \" holds a winning hand . \\n',\n"," b'ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ? \\nyou remember , he was the title character in that 70\\'s sitcom , \" welcome back kotter . \" \\nalways trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife\\'s tuna casserole . \\n \" so , \" you ask , \" where is he now ? \" \\nmr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker . \\nthat\\'s right . \\ni\\'m not sure if it\\'s his main source of income , but from what i\\'ve heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time . \\nand there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater . \\nyou silly goose . \\nwell , gabe kaplan isn\\'t in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler\\'s life . \\nbut rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection . \\nsorry about the segue , or lack thereof . \\nmatt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker . \\nhe\\'s been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug . \\nhe goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win . \\nin the beginning of the film , he\\'s built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play . \\nmike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia . \\nmike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand . \\nmonths later , he\\'s paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck . \\nwhen mike\\'s best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash . \\nalthough mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life . \\nto make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters . \\nthis is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth . \\nrounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former . \\nthe card clubs mike and worm frequent aren\\'t very glamorous at all . \\nthere\\'s a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots . \\nexcept for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table . \\nthe reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it . \\nwe\\'re given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them . \\nmatt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker . \\ned norton\\'s worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they\\'re worth . \\njohn turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments . \\nhe\\'s both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro\\'s low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich\\'s heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself . \\nmartin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike\\'s law professors , abe petrovsky . \\nwhile landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one\\'s self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending . \\nperhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn\\'t seem to have much presence on screen . \\nshe\\'s a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn\\'t be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon\\'s reactions instead . \\na good thing about rounders is that it doesn\\'t get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can\\'t find time for humor . \\nthe film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales . \\none game in a cigar club had me in stitches . \\n \" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , \" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other . \\ni was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys . \\nwith all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing . \\nyou might think you know a lot about poker , but think again . \\nluckily , we\\'re given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what\\'s going on . \\nthe narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do . \\nit\\'s nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world . \\nas a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades . \\nwait ! \\nas a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace . \\nhang on ! \\npacked with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house . \\nokay , i guess that\\'s enough . \\noh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol\\' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein\\'s mother . \\n',\n"," b\"the haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us . \\nif you've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie . \\nthey have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film . \\nbut , the one i always like are the &quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film . \\nfor instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers . \\nthey had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? \\nwell , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well . \\nunfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i'd be getting some pretty angry e-mails from overprotective mothers . \\nthat title would be the confusing . \\nok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly . \\nit basically serves up no purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb . \\nliam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth . \\nthe haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money . \\nbefore i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film . \\nfirst , the house is great- looking . \\nit looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot . \\nit looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it . \\nthis is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film . \\nthings look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight . \\nhaunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie . \\nthe hill house is not eerie . \\nit is beautiful , but not the least bit frightening . \\never heard of lili taylor ? \\nbefore this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now . \\nshe gives the only satisfactory performance in the film . \\ndespite the dry dialogue and boring/confusing concept , she manages to light up the screen every time she appears , but unfortunately , her co-stars are usually following right behind . \\nowen wilson , who plays luke , is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance , other then taylor . \\nhe is basically there for the comic relief , and his character development is poor in all other areas . \\nall of the characters are desperately underdeveloped . \\nwilson had potential as luke , but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs . \\nliam neeson and catherine zeta-jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film . \\ntheir characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot . \\nthey just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting's coffin . \\nthe plot is terrible . \\nthe opening scene of the film is very important , but the director makes it too obvious by getting close-ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film . \\nas i sat through the film , i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish . \\nnell , lili taylor's character , goes from the hunted to the savior . \\nit makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film . \\nhe forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in-depth information . \\nfor instance , the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program . \\nbut , we get zilch for the other four . \\nplus , two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes . \\nand the worst part : most horror films have killings . \\nfor some reason , they kill off luke at the end of the film . \\nno reason whatsoever , just off with his head , literally . \\noverall , the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie . \\nbad plot , confusing storyline and a waste of good talent . \\nhopefully , liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential . \\nhopefully , lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film . \\nand hopefully , other horror films , such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house , will not be as bad as this one . \\n\",\n"," b'vikings v . bears ? \\nno , this isn\\'t the lineup for monday night football . \\nrather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in \" the 13th warrior , \" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory . \\nbased on michael crichton\\'s book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought . \\ntheir strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword . \\nluckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film . \\nantonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador . \\naccompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village . \\nwe see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude . \\nthey laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won . \\nbut their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land . \\nhelp is needed quickly . \\nan elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives . \\nafter a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more \" not of norse blood \" are needed to ensure victory . \\npersonally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity . \\nnonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th . \\nthe group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives . \\nof course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors . \\nbut he ably shows that it\\'s not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog . \\nhe is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ? \\nit does not look promising . \\nthese creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale . \\nthey are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies . \\nthey attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon . \\nthe warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods . \\nthey are ready to sacrifice their lives . \\n \" this is a good way to die , \" says one of the fallen warriors . \\ndespite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience . \\nat many points , i was even confused . \\nfor example , somewhere in the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land . \\nhe seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis . \\nhowever , the sub-plot never fully materializes , and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion . \\nthere are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate . \\nthe leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma . \\nhowever , banderas\\'s role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special . \\nan entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order . \\nalso , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night , which made battles very difficult to follow . \\ni would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy . \\nas it stands , the film manages more confusion than intensity . \\nit would make thor cry . \\n',\n"," b'teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood . \\nevery year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand . \\nthe formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal . \\nyou add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span . \\nthe response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due . \\nthat is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash . \\njosie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times . \\nshe has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office . \\nbut she is very much dismayed with her position in life . \\nthere is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media . \\nso when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation . \\nconstantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c . reilly ) . \\nthe two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter . \\nhowever , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field . \\nobviously , the field assignment involves a high school . \\nspecifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and \" becoming one of them . \" \\ni don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t . \\nthe movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school . \\ninterwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again . \\nfortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting . \\nthey include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body . \\nalso , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative . \\nthe humor found in this film is actually quite amusing . \\ntypical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor . \\none scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical . \\nmost of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy . \\nbut those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie . \\nfollowing this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting . \\nit is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film . \\nin this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch . \\nshe is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions . \\nand although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time . \\nat one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher . \\nbut she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance . \\nfollowing barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live ) . \\nshe seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic . \\nit is these \" qualities \" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent . \\nluckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film . \\ndavid arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined . \\nand as a central character he gets to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed . \\nin a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business . \\nnever been kissed is a mediocre film at best . \\nthe predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception . \\nthe acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light . \\nunfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash . \\n',\n"," b'\\'pleasantville\\' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood\\'s lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed \\n

content and thematic elements \\ngenre : drama \\nin my opinion : \\nin short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is . \\nreview : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions . \\nthe town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant . \\nthere is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate . \\nput simply , it\\'s a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for . \\nj one big note however is that it is only a 50\\'s sitcom that airs in reruns on an \" oldies \" tv station ? or is it ? \\ni had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed . \\ni found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office . \\nbut it wasn\\'t until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy \" dollar theaters \" after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced . \\nit is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some \" healthy \" immorality is not a world at all . \\ninstead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn\\'t give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right . \\nthere is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story . \\nnow i\\'m not saying that\\'s necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be . \\nbesides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch . \\nthe visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable . \\nafter spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it\\'s hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more . \\na truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork . \\nthat said , the plot goes as such . \\ndavid and jennifer are two very 90\\'s high school twins with the typical \" relationship \" outline of don\\'t-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won\\'t-mess-with-yours . \\nthey demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today . \\ndavid is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation . \\nbut when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home . \\nnevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed . \\nand , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them . \\nnot only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place . \\npeople got hurt . \\nthey cried . \\nthey became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that\\'s when their physical world turned colors as well . \\nthis can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear . \\ni hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we\\'ll never know what we could have done better . \\nuntil the next great movie i see ,

george lucas\\' 1977 classic , star wars . \\nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \\narguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \\nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \\ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \\nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \\nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \\nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \\nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \\nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \\nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \\nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \\nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo\\'s young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \\nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \\non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \\nqui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \\nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \\ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \\nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \\nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \\nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin\\'s turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \\nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \\nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \\none of the reasons the film\\'s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \\nit\\'s unclear whose story phantom menace is . \\nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke\\'s story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \\nbut it\\'s unclear whether this new film is anakin\\'s story or obi-wan\\'s . \\nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it\\'s a shaky foundation . \\nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \\non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \\nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \\nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \\nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \\nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \\nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \\nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \\nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn\\'t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \\nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \\nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \\nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \\nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \\nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \\nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \\nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \\nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas\\' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \\nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \\nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \\neach location is elaborate and complex . \\nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \\nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren\\'t possible when the films were made . \\nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas\\' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \\nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \\nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \\nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \\nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \\nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas\\' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \\njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon\\'s accidental sidekick . \\njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \\nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \\nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn\\'t completely convincing . \\nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \\nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \\nyou accept that he\\'s there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \\ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \\non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn\\'t mind him at all . \\na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \\ndespite all the film\\'s struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one\\'s destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \\nfortunately , lucas hasn\\'t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \\nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film\\'s thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \\nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \\nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \\nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \\nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \\nthe phantom menace won\\'t win any major oscars . \\nit probably won\\'t beat titanic\\'s box office record . \\nand it\\'s not even the best star wars film ( i\\'d put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \\nbut it\\'s an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \\nthe film can\\'t live up to it\\'s hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \\nbut it\\'s still worth seeing . . . \\nprobably more than once . \\n',\n"," b'this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james . \\ndick turpin ( sid james ) and his gang which includes harriett/harry ( barbara windsor ) and tom \" doc \" scholl ( peter butterworth ) , terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies : \" stand and deliver ! \" \\nowing to the increased occurrence of turpin\\'s robberies , captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners ( kenneth williams ) and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin\\'s area of influence to bring him to justice . \\nthey are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) . \\ntheir intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies . \\nhowever , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin . \\nthen again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner ! \\nthere is no doubt that this is a \\'sid james\\' carry on movie . \\nhe excels in double roles ( as in \\'carry on- don\\'t lose your head\\' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious . \\nbarbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques\\' small but effective role as the rector\\'s housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection . \\njack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part . \\npeter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw\\'s character appears only briefly in the film . \\nthe only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the \\'birds of paradise\\' and sporting a fake french accent . \\nwhen her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit ! \\na carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie . \\nthe jokes are bluer , the script is poorer ( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell ) , but the music is a marked improvement . \\nalthough nearly all the regulars appear , they seem to be just going through the motions . \\nnone of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here . \\njust a selection of crude jokes and repititive double-entendres . \\n',\n"," b'georges polti once wrote a paper called \" the thirty-six dramatic situations , \" in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty-six different situations . \\nthis may be the modern restatement of the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes , \" there\\'s nothing new under the sun . \" \\nthe faculty , the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez , certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion . \\nthere\\'s not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing . \\ndrawing elements from both the puppet masters and invasion of the body snatchers , screenwriter kevin williamson ( of scream 2 credit ) gives us a horror tale set in middle america ( ohio ) one eventful fall . \\nmaking use of a cast of unusually stock characters , williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day-style but rather \" through the back door . \" \\nparasitic aliens take over the faculty of a run-down high school and soon have infested most of the student body , leaving it up to the ensemble of principal characters to win the day . \\nthe lack of gusto is the movie\\'s major stumbling block . \\neven though the genre has seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this , they\\'ve been saved by an energetic approach . \\nthis casts more than a shadow of a doubt on williamson\\'s ability , who enjoyed success with the wes craven-directed scream but couldn\\'t pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer . \\nalthough he designs the faculty with more of a sci-fi bent than his typical slasher picture , it still comes down to the same results : throw the stock characters in a steel cage match and see who comes out alive . \\non that level , the main roles are played by virtual unknowns . \\nonly the recognizeable elijah wood ( deep impact ) is at the front ; other than that , the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of the alien teachers . \\nperhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up-and-comers to the fame that their scream and last summer counterparts achieved ; but to do that , they\\'d all need to star in their own wb television show about the horrors of puberty a la \" dawson\\'s creek . \" \\nneedless to say the acting is far from top notch , nor does necessity ask that it should be . \\nthere is a moment or two of genuine horror , but unfortunately williamson and rodriguez did not take the story far enough in the sci-fi direction to make any use of it . \\nin sum , the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off . \\n',\n"," b\"upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises . \\ni'm twenty-two , but have been accused of looking sixteen . \\nyet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close-knit , yet troubled sisters . \\ndirector pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters . \\nthe family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family . \\nthere is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home . \\nsquabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history . \\nperhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness . \\nno situation is over-wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems . \\nthis probably is a result of the film being from a stage play . \\nthe play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright . \\nwhat seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa . \\nin fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness . \\nlegs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster . \\nonly after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble . \\nin the quiet after the music we muse that it's sad that music has to cease , and families falter . \\nthe movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite . \\nhe trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance . \\ndrawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous . \\nthe mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate's hold of the family isn't strong enough to hold off the winds of change . \\nas michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever . \\nthe movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women . \\nnote : this is the first movie review i've ever written , any responses on it would be greatly appreciated . \\n : ) \\n\",\n"," b' \" varsity

good-heartedfrom 1999 . \\nit is another one of those small-town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good-hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the \" big game . \" \\nby the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? \\nwill everyone in the town turn against the coach ? \\nwill the team win the climactic game ? \\ndo cats bathe themselves regularly ? \\nthe so-called \" hero \" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead-end town . \\nat least he\\'s got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . \\nheck , in one scene , the front page of the town\\'s newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers\\' big win the night before . \\nwhen the team\\'s star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team\\'s leader , but his few minutes of glory do not last long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . \\nand after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second-to-last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the \" bad guy \" ) . \\nworse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john\\'s scholarship chances if the badgers don\\'t win their final game . \\nthe plotting of \" varsity blues \" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . \\nadmittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . \\nthroughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983\\'s \" all the right moves . \" \\none of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not john , who , played by van der beek ( of tv\\'s \" dawson\\'s creek \" ) , is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities . \\nwhile i probably shouldn\\'t blame this on van der beek , since the inauspicious and \" by-the-numbers \" screenplay by w . peter iliff isn\\'t of any help , he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in \" all the right moves . \" \\nthe story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama . \\nthe romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don\\'t think i\\'ve seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence . \\nsmart does not allow her character to become the \" passive girlfriend , \" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . \\nit\\'s too bad the camera didn\\'t linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts . \\nthe adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football . \\njohn\\'s relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . \\nhis father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn\\'t want any part of that . \\nhis mother stands beside her \" big , strong husband \" and is a passive female . \\nfinally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional . \\nsaving \" varsity blues \" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . \\nthe scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn\\'t overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . \\nbut leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? \\ni seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . \\ndo we really need another high-school sports film ? \\nno , we don\\'t , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . \\n \" varsity blues , \" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts . \\n',\n"," b'the idea at the center of the devil\\'s advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- \" the last humanist \" . \\nhe appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , \" vanity -- by far my favorite sin \" . \\nal pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( \" lemme givya a piece o\\' inside wisdom on god . . . \" , \" i have a million names . . . \" ) , as john milton -- the devil . \\nthe main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam\\'s the time bandits . \\nbut the film , is something else , something original . \\npart of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn\\'t try to become any profound study of power . \\nthis is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking . \\nit is also entertaining . \\nthere is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind\\'s eye . \\nthe final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen\\'s fargo . \\nthe central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james\\' the turn of the screw , and oates\\' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows . \\nits nice to know that things like this are still

rather , i\\'m referring to the mere knowledge of its existence . \\nusually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . \\nit has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly . \\nthat\\'s a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing . \\nwhat\\'s more , it\\'s surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history . \\nprincess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside . \\napparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) . \\nher banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo . \\nthis development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall . \\nhowever , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo . \\nas a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner . \\nit takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing . \\nbut it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude . \\nhe is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort . \\nwhile hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed . \\nhe also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a \" sensation \" at court . \\nin one of the film\\'s best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance . \\nit is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in \" sensations , \" an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) . \\nsocial commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment . \\nthe performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime . \\nher supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls\\' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch . \\nonly john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess\\'s identity . \\nthe story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky . \\nit is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn\\'t given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there . \\nwhen it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible . \\nprincess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp . \\nstill , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out . \\nit is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem . \\n',\n"," b'the general\\'s daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we\\'ll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film . \\nit\\'s confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious

brutally predictable conspiracy thriller . \\nthe punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general\\'s daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense . \\nour hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army\\'s criminal investigation division . \\nhis latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation . \\ncomplicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee . \\ngeneral campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in . \\nteamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough ,

the general\\'s daughter\\'s problems . \\nscenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze . \\ndirector simon west likely thinks he\\'s covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film\\'s fatal flaw . \\nit\\'s a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story\\'s few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them . \\ncharacters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell\\'s still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans . \\nwest just can\\'t help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general\\'s daughter . \\nhe even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits . \\nbubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell . \\nthe slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell\\'s mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) . \\nthere\\'s something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another . \\nindeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : \" shouldn\\'t you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? \" ) . \\neven the lame device of brenner and sunhill\\'s sexual history provides a few winning zingers . \\ngoldman\\'s dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you\\'ll find in most so-called comedies . \\ndialogue , unfortunately , just isn\\'t enough to make a quality script . \\nit\\'s difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) . \\nby the time the general\\'s daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west\\'s heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun . \\nit\\'s

running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998 . \\nofficial release : halloween \\nreviewed by vince yim \\n`you think you know all about vampires . . . believe \\nme . . . you \\nknow f * ck all . ' \\nwith these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) . \\nmade into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being . \\nso , what's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ? \\nwith that out of the way , let me say this . \\nthis film is bad . \\nthis film is really , really bad . \\nyet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable . \\nwith all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade . \\nstill , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film . \\nagreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever . \\nperiod . \\nrazor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film . \\nthe film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) . \\nbut aside from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film conventions . \\nthat is , unless that is intentional . \\nrazor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese . \\nyou can't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle . \\nyou'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) . \\nyou'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably . \\nand then , there's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) . \\nthe film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you've most likely forgotten the main point of the story . \\nbut in case you really care , she's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find . \\nas much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups . \\nalmost destined for cult-status , the film's campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards the film . \\nwhile this may not necessarily be the film you'd want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies . \\n\",\n"," b'plunkett & macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions . \\ni have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking -- used properly it can save a movie ( see stigmata ) -- but it ruins this one , making a muddled , incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise . \\nthere are certain genres that just don\\'t go together . \\nthe film opens with a sequence that i still don\\'t understand . \\nit involves some sort of prison outbreak , a robbery , and a gem that keeps being eaten . \\nin any case , the caper ( whatever it may be ) brings together plunkett and macleane ( robert carlyle and johnny lee miller , respectively ) , two happy-go-lucky brits with no way to make a living . \\nthey make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america . \\ntheir first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca ( liv tyler ) ; a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier . \\nhis decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name \" gentleman highwaymen . \" \\nlady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice , a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career . \\nhe demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately , leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ( ken stott ) who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals . \\nmeanwhile , macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett , who doesn\\'t want his plans to be foiled by his partner\\'s mindless romantic travails . \\ndirector jake scott , son of ridley scott ( alien , blade runner ) , has his father\\'s knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera . \\nmost of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid , jerky way that it\\'s impossible to comprehend what\\'s going on . \\nthe camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity . \\ninstead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention-deficit-disorder edits . \\nhe barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut . \\nthe weird , almost defiant lack of dialogue ( there are no -- no -- conversations lasting over , say , 20 seconds ) undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters . \\nthe love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different , emotionless and unrealistic . \\nwhen the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover , there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal ; he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film . \\nplunkett and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance but since its style , quite frankly , blows , the film has no hope of succeeding on any level . \\ni wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but i couldn\\'t -- it was so kinetic it gave me a headache . \\n',\n"," b'the one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film . \\nsince june , i haven\\'t been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky , shrieking out a-ha\\'s \" take on me \" in his yellow miata . \\nwhy would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine ? \\nhonestly , i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie . \\nman , was i wrong . \\ncorky romano is one of those throwaway , clich ? -ridden tv-star-to-film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots . \\nfortunately for chris kattan\\'s precariously positioned career , corky does have some good laughs , even if most of them are of the lowest-brow variety . \\nkattan plays the title character , the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny \\'80s tunes , bright ties , and banal coffee mug slogans ( \" you don\\'t have to be crazy to work here , but it sure helps . \" ) . \\nwhen his mob boss dad ( peter falk ) is about to be put away on murder charges , his bungling , lughead brothers ( peter berg and chris penn ) rope in innocent , black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence . \\npredictably , hijinks ensue . \\nif the basic plot sounds bad , wait until you get into the inner-workings of this clunker . \\nthe writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity . \\ncorky\\'s fbi agent identity is named corky pissant ( \" that\\'s pronounced pees-ahn . \\nit\\'s french . \" ) . \\nhe becomes a first-rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr . magoo-style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations , which plays like something out of a sitcom . \\nand not a good sitcom , i mean . \\nthe romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other\\'s face . \\nand in a scene taken straight from there\\'s something about mary , corky gives a dachshund mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . \\nbut it\\'s not a complete disaster . \\nthe manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments , including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren , a german shephard , and a kilo of cocaine . \\nplus , berg -- whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope -- gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie . \\nand , it\\'s nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work . \\nunfortunately for those out there who can\\'t truly appreciate animal or fart jokes , corky won\\'t have much to offer you . \\nso the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv , asking , \" who is corky ? \" \\nyou can simply reply , \" who cares ? \" \\n',\n"," b'14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . \\nin 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california . \\nwe laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . \\ntwo years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . \\nnow , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . \\nthey\\'ve been cremated . \\nvegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two . \\nthe premise is basically the same . \\nclark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . \\nhis wife ellen ( beverly d\\'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . \\nof course a \" vacation \" movie wouldn\\'t be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . \\nthere isn\\'t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . \\nit\\'s really just a skit movie . \\nthere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . \\nthe first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . \\nthe second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . \\nvegas vacation comes off like the first . \\na good example of the latter would be last year\\'s black sheep . \\nthe problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn\\'t really fit into a movie mold . \\nin these cases , a \" plot \" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . \\nhave a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . \\nsuch is the case with this movie\\'s mini-plots . \\nclark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold\\'s money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d\\'lyn ) as an exotic dancer . \\nthe simple fact is : this movie isn\\'t funny . \\nat first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . \\nchase plays clark griswold really well . \\nhe made the character and he is the character . \\nd\\'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn\\'t show any signs of redemption . \\nas for the two new griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes to mind . \\nthe \" vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . \\nthey\\'re so generic , you\\'ll expect the credits to read \" girl #1 as audrey griswold \" . \\nvegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . \\nyes , it\\'s true that vegas vacation isn\\'t even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . \\nfirst off , why did they leave off the national lampoon\\'s heading on the title ? \\ni couldn\\'t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn\\'t want to be associated with such a lame film . \\nthat\\'s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they\\'d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn\\'t . \\nthere is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . \\nthe first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80\\'s including mr . \\nmom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller\\'s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . \\nwowzers ! \\nwhat a r ? sum ? ! \\nlooking at the names , you\\'d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980\\'s . \\nwell that\\'s not all . \\nthis guy also brought us 90\\'s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . \\nvegas vacation , however , didn\\'t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . \\nthis time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies . \\nvegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel . \\nif this sounds like a wild idea , it\\'s not . \\nrevenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . \\nvegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . \\nsunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it\\'s quite out of place . \\nstephen kessler\\'s jejune direction doesn\\'t help things either . \\nhe only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish . \\neach consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . \\nwe started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters . \\nnot too bad . \\nthen we had national lampoon\\'s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who\\'s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . \\nlastly we had national lampoon\\'s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . \\nkessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . \\ngranted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . \\nif you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn\\'t anything here worth seeing . \\nif you loved them , don\\'t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . \\nif you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ? \\n',\n"," b'plot : a dude and his brother are driving cross-country and decide to fool

harassing all three of the young whippersnappers . . . ? \\nyou bet ! \\nbuckle up , dorothy . . . this is gonna be one bumpy ride ! \\ncritique : a good ol\\' time at the movies ! \\nhere\\'s a film that actually gives away most of its plotline in its trailer and doesn\\'t really bring anything \" new \" to the forefront ( if you\\'ve seen flicks like duel and breakdown , you\\'ve crossed this path before ) , but still manages to entertain you gangbusters , with realistic situations , believable characters , funny moments , thrills , chills , the whole shebang . \\nlet\\'s give it up for director john dahl , who continues to put out solid films every other year ( if you haven\\'t seen red rock west , do yourself a favor right now , and jot it down on a piece of paper and rent it at your earliest convenience ) . \\nand much like that film , this one has an excellent premise and sets everything up at an even pace . \\nit gives you a little bit of background on each of the main three characters , and then shows you how one small prank , can lead to a whole lotta trouble for everyone ! \\npaul walker really surprised me in this movie , since i\\'ve never much thought of him as anything more than a pretty face ( and damn , is it ever pretty or what ? ! ) \\nbut here , he actually manages to put some depth behind the looks and that\\'s always appreciated in films in which you are so closely tied to the main characters . \\nsobieski is also good , but she isn\\'t in the movie for as long as you\\'d think , but the man who really takes this film to another level , is steve zahn . \\nif you\\'ve loved this guy as the \" goofball \" in most of his previous roles , you\\'ll appreciate him even more here , as the dude who starts off as one of the most manic and excited human beings i\\'ve seen in quite some time ( \" this is so awesome ! ! \" ) , \\nonly to turn into a man scared out of his wits by the end of the flick . \\nand speaking of the ending , boy , does this movie deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what ? ! ? \\nthe arrow and i were practically in each others arms ( well , maybe i\\'m exaggerating , but you catch my drift ) as each minute brought about another turn of events which in turn , took it all to an even higher level . \\nonce again , kudos to director dahl for being able to generate that type of intensity , suspense and tension , with a great score , editing , style and camerawork . \\nplot-wise , i too did wonder how the \" bad guy \" was able to track them so well , but it didn\\'t really bother me all that much ( you can assume that he had bugged their car ? ) . \\nbut pretty much everything else in the story stuck like glue and i couldn\\'t help but put myself in their shoes and appreciate their thoroughly desperate circumstance . \\na great movie with an even cooler ending , this film will likely be remembered as one of the better thrillers of the year . \\n \" this is

end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon . \\nhere we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life . \\nwhat i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution . \\ni mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ? \\nas was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior . \\nin fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything . \\nbut it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison . \\na bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs . \\nin fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining . \\ni haven't had such a good time at the movies in months . \\nit tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker . \\nthe ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers . \\njust before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead . \\nflick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them . \\nhe heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) . \\nflick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position . \\nthe most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation . \\ncreated by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen . \\nthe bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action . \\nthis is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative . \\nthe film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) . \\nbut the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters . \\nflick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story . \\nbut the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar . \\nall of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory . \\nin my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence . \\nin concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it . \\nwith such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through . \\nit really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience . \\nafter a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty . \\n\",\n"," b'my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled \" dragnet \" reruns off the air . \\nsure , i\\'d seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv . \\neven though \" dragnet \" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50\\'s propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous \" blue boy \" episode of \" dragnet . \" \\nfor anyone like me who got laughs out of webb\\'s rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i . \\nas what would happen if sgt . \\njoe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic . \\nin this election year , i\\'m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth . \\nthe movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb\\'s office door and enters . \\nhe gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up . \\nthe \" produced and directed by jack webb \" card pretty much goes without saying . \\nthis is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot . \\ni certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i . \\ngives us more -- much more . \\nwebb\\'s mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up . \\nthe captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will \" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . \" \\n ( whether the \" lace panties \" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . ) \\nthis , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens\\' life a living hell . \\nfor those of you who haven\\'t been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here\\'s a reprint of a typical monologue of his . \\ni can\\'t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i\\'m talking about . . . \\n \" now you listen to me , youngster . \\nsomeday you\\'ll wake up fighting on a beach and you\\'ll pray to god somebody doesn\\'t get killed because of your foolishness . . . \\ni\\'ve got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you\\'re gonna turn around and i\\'ll be standing right there . \" \\ni couldn\\'t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i . \\n ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day\\'s work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) . \\nhe meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i . \\nwebb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , \" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? \" \\nbogart he ain\\'t . \\nthe other d . i . \\ngets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , \" he\\'s a damn good d . i . \\n . . . \\ni guess i\\'m just a little jealous . \" \\njoin the club , we\\'re all jealous of jack webb\\'s way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman\\'s place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display . \\n \" you expect me to talk to you . . . \\nin _here_ ? ! \" he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras . \\nthe woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen . \\na little girl spots him in the store and demands , \" what are you doing in here . . . you\\'re a man , aren\\'t you ? \" \\nhe doesn\\'t reply , but you know he\\'s thinking in his head , \" what an odd species of human -- so small . \\nmust be one of those children everyone\\'s been talking about . \" \\nthis poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he\\'s responsible for . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t focus too closely on webb\\'s romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills . \\nafter two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , \" was that flea you killed a male or female ? \" \\nowens replies , \" a male , sir . \" \\nwebb yells to the platoon , \" this ain\\'t the one ! \" \\nthat such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment . \\nbut we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century . \\nwebb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines . \\nsomeone wanting to parody this movie couldn\\'t do a more comical job than webb did . \\nit makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself . \\nthere\\'s a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter . \\nwebb bursts in the room and shouts , \" what did i tell you about laughing ? ! \" \\nto which the private replies , \" sir , only nine-year-old girls laugh , sir ! \" \\nand let me tell you , i was as happy as a nine-year- old girl while watching this movie . \\n',\n"," b'uncompromising french director robert bresson\\'s \" lancelot of the lake \" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory\\'s \" morte darthur . \" \\ninstead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . \\nchivalry has no place in \" lancelot of the lake , \" except as that of a dying ideal . \\nbresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin\\'s command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ\\'s blood . \\nbresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . \\nthe opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . \\nsince the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn\\'t carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films . \\nwe never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness . \\nbut , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . \\nrather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . \\nlancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . \\nthe greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur\\'s wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . \\neven when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . \\nhe knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . \\nwhen sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot\\'s defense . \\nit is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . \\nbresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men\\'s hearts and minds . \\n \" lancelot of the lake \" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . \\nhe uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . \\nthe music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film\\'s thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . \\nlike most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . \\nall the actors he used in \" lancelot of the lake \" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . \\nnever once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . \\ninstead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . \\nin some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn\\'t . \\nthe final montage of arthur\\'s men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment . \\nhowever , other times bresson\\'s uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . \\nfor instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses\\' legs . \\nhe does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . \\nwhile there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . \\nnevertheless , \" lancelot of the lake \" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . \\nbresson\\'s style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . \\nby re-evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns \" lancelot of the lake \" into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film . \\n',\n"," b'your first clue that something isn\\'t gonna be quite right with the movie you\\'re about to see : it\\'s heavily christmas-themed and its release

\" diversions \" and rob the place . \\non paper , it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy , but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he\\'s looking at the makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller . \\nit\\'s not like the man isn\\'t capable . . . \\nfar from it . \\nhe\\'s the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may . \\nhe wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i\\'ve ever seen in last year\\'s ronin . \\nbut he\\'s certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers . . . \\nput reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr . moreau . \\nstep one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : cast ben affleck in the role of the world\\'s most generic hero . \\nhe gets no good one-liners , he doesn\\'t get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways , and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie . \\nhis name is rudy ( short for rudolph , in all likelihood . \\nsee , it\\'s called reindeer games . \\nget it ? \\nget it ? \\nshut up . ) \\nin the past , affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor , and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man . \\nstep two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : gary sinise\\'s villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with . \\nhe\\'s dirty and potty-mouthed , he\\'s got long , scruffy hair and a goatee , and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them . \\nhe\\'s also extremely inept at what he does . \\nhe thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises , and he trusts affleck\\'s character to pull through even after , time and time and time again , he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him . \\nbut instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role , sinise seems to think he\\'s playing some sort of tough , smart , and smooth criminal mastermind , rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script . \\n[on a side note , gary sinise wins this week\\'s \" title ! \" \\naward , as he\\'s the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings . \\nlast week\\'s winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards . ] \\nhow to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that , instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent , make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely . \\nthis is a bad movie . \\nand what\\'s worse is that , except for a few moments near the not-so-stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous , reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad . \\nif they\\'d done that much , at least i would have been entertained . \\n',\n"," b' \" you can\\'t have any of this . \\nit\\'s all mine ! \" \\n--- a

threat that needs to be stopped . \\nthey enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm . \\nher mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed . \\nthe king\\'s sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice . \\nduring the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled . \\nabraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love . \\nin this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm . \\nafter each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn\\'s . \\nbecause of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself . \\nas alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered . \\nif there\\'s one thing i can\\'t stand when i see a film , it\\'s when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty . \\nfilms like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list . \\nthis film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dante\\'s inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot . \\nif there aren\\'t bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone . \\ncompelling , but ultimately not . \\nthe opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images . \\nthe credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn\\'t pop up until near the end of the sequence . \\nwhen the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv . \\nat least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett . \\nat the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing ) . \\nfor some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance . \\none over-alled cretin handles the presence\\'s gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there\\'s an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier-wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds . \\nwhy would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of \" rednecks \" when you yourself had all of these cool powers ? \\nand how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? \\ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment . \\nthe most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence . \\nthe character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . \\na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . \\nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . \\nwhen she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . \\nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . \\nwhen it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . \\nthe box for the film claims \" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . \\ncontains nudity and graphic violence \" . \\nwhile both is certainly true , there doesn\\'t seem to be much of either in any large amounts . \\nbesides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . \\nas for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . \\nice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com . \\nit has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent . \\nbesides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice . \\ni haven\\'t had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set . \\n',\n"," b'when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to

just can\\'t help but have fond memories of something like that . \\nsometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid . \\nat the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me . \\ndespite how horrid a film may be

wish someone had stopped him . . . \\nbecause he\\'s done it again . \\nthe plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale . \\nin fact , it was everything that 8mm is not . \\nin the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government . \\nkeep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves . \\nhe returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it\\'s important as well ) . \\nhe\\'s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery . \\nafter her husband\\'s death she comes across a film in his private safe . \\nit appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera . \\nthe woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film . \\nso he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film . \\nthe main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless . \\nwelles is actually selected for the case by the old woman\\'s lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) . \\nwhen you first see him , your first instinct is that he\\'s behind the whole thing . \\nthe choice of casting does the film in . \\nthen , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him . \\nthe only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet . \\nso your first instinct has now been confirmed . \\nthen , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous \" since we\\'re going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing \" moments ) . \\nbut earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he\\'s told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended . \\nhuh ? \\nalso , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back . \\nso why did he give it up in the first place ? ! \\nthe lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! \\nit\\'s totally absurd . . . \\nand this is the screenwriter of seven ? \\nlate in the film there\\'s a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character\\'s guns ends up underneath a car . \\ncage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table . \\njames gandolfini\\'s character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of \" suspense \" . \\nyou see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he\\'s trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching . \\ngo around to the other side of the car ! ! \\nthis goes on for minutes . \\nthen , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car . \\nboy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves . \\ni think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he\\'s seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn ! \\nwe actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard . \\nother things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that . \\nwhenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it . \\nawful decision there joel . \\nanother is cage\\'s performance . \\nat this point he\\'s capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad . \\nfor 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he\\'s interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) .

of course , and then is pursued by a determined u . s . marshal named fergus falls ( richard crenna , unnecessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones\\' already smirky oscar-winning role ) . \\nthere\\'s also a mystery brunette ( melinda mcgraw ) and an assassination subplot involving the u . n . secretary general , but like any of it matters . \\n \" wrongfully accused \" gets off to an assured start , with an in-concert nielsen , touted \" lord of the violin \" by bare-chested posters , pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo-clad mosh in front of the stage . \\nnice touch . \\nmost of the scenes that follow , however , never top the opener . \\n ( hysterical exceptions : the mentos and \" baywatch \" goofs . ) \\nmovie parodies are crammed in at an almost-subliminal rate , but most are empty . \\nwhen a giant snake lunges onto the screen and snatches a cast member a la \" anaconda \" or baseball players disappear into a \" field of dreams \" -esque cornfield , there\\'s really nothing to laugh at . \\nother moments , like an interlude in a fishing shop , are so unfocused that you\\'re not sure what you\\'re supposed to be laughing at . \\nthere seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send-ups here , so it\\'s possible that director/writer pat proft , by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture of the two , guarantees something is sure to stick . \\nand what does stick sticks well , particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks and hard-boiled dialogue , what those \" naked gun \" s ( which proft collaborated on ) did great ; these bits are so on-target that they allow you to remember \" wrongfully accused \" as an almost-halfway-there spoof instead of a lame-brained failure . \\nthe movie might have been cursed to begin with , opening fast on the heels of \" mafia ! \" , from proft colleague jim abrahams , and \" baseketball , \" from proft colleague david zucker , but it\\'s a strong possibility that nobody is going to be accusing \" wrongfully accused \" of being nielsen\\'s funniest . \\n',\n"," b'if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don\\'t look particularly good because i\\'m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . \\nif that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : \" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don\\'t have to . \" \\nbut i know that\\'s bunk-you\\'re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . \\nso i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . \\nyou know the feeling , when you\\'re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . \\nsometimes i think that\\'s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . \\nadmit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . \\nso do i . \\nso i saw \" supernova . \" \\ntruth be told , \" supernova \" wasn\\'t quite as bad as i thought it might be . \\nmaybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn\\'t started tinkering with the director\\'s ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . \\nmaybe i\\'m becoming a softy . \\nin any case , i didn\\'t find \" supernova \" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . \\nbut it\\'s still bad . \\nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel \" nightingale . \" \\nthe crew includes captain a . j . \\nmarley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . \\nthere are some attempts at \" characterization , \" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . \\ndon\\'t expect any more explanation , because you won\\'t get it . \\nanyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . \\nduring the dimension jump ( i think that\\'s what it\\'s called , but don\\'t hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . \\nhe calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . \\nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . \\nhave you seen \" alien ? \" \\nhave you seen \" event horizon \" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \\ngood . \\nthen you\\'ve seen \" supernova . \" \\npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \\nafter all , no one\\'s going to think for a second that troy won\\'t turn out to be a villain . \\nbut the bigger problem with \" supernova \" is that it can\\' t just stick to the simple plot it\\'s afforded . \\nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it\\'s a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \\nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \\ndid the ship\\'s computer learn something about humanity ? \\nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \\nand just what does the film\\'s title signify , if anything ? \\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn\\'t developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\nbassett and spader\\'s characters start off hating each other . \\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they\\'re engaging in some hanky-panky . \\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\nmaybe that\\'s why the film\\'s title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you\\'re seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\ndoesn\\'t make sense . \\nsince i didn\\'t understand anything about these characters\\' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\nnot a whit . \\nit\\'s a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\nthey don\\'t find it . \\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\nsexual tension ? \\nmore like constipation . \\nmaybe they\\'re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \" \\nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film\\'s biggest forehead-slapper . \\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\nhe\\' s awfully one-note , but it\\'s not as if he\\'s given any more notes to work with . \\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\nphillips broods . \\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn\\'t paying much attention by then . \\n \" supernova \" is pretty awful , but i\\'m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\nthat\\'s it . \\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you\\'ll probably hate it more than i will . \\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven\\' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn\\'t going to save the film . \\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \\nit usually results in a bad movie , and that\\'s what \" supernova \" is . \\n',\n"," b'when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called \" the postman , \" i thought , \" an american version of \\'il postino ? \\' \\nstarring costner ? \\ngod help us ! \" \\nwhen i found out that it was not a remake of \" postino \" but an postapocalyptic epic , i thought , \" \\'landworld ? \\' \\nplease , god , make him stop ! \" \\nas it turns out , \" the postman \" is a much better film than i had expected . \\ndespite being set in 2013 , the movie is , at heart , a western : a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers ; a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back . \\nthe setting , however , allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance : american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars , and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages . \\nthe struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it . \\ncostner\\'s nameless character , a wandering actor , rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy-machine salesman turned bandit king . \\nour hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman . \\ntaking the uniform and bag of mail , he passes himself off as a representative of \" the restored united states . \" \\nhe is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets . \\none young disciple , ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , organizes a full-scale postal service . \\nford spreads the postman\\'s message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once-meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule . \\nas war breaks out between bethlehem\\'s army and the postal workers , costner\\'s character steps into the legend he created and goes from self-centered loner to leader of the revolution . \\nhis lie of the restored united states becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy . \\n \" postman \" is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide-eyed optimism ( sort of \" sergio leone meets frank capra \" ) , but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling . \\nwhat could have been another knock-off of \" the road warrior \" ( like \" waterworld \" was ) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble . \\ntate is the stand-out in the movie\\'s large cast . \\nford lincoln mercury ( self-named ) is the polar opposite of o-dog , tate\\'s character in his debut film , \" menace ii society \" ( 1993 ) , and tate makes ford\\'s innocent belief in hope as convincing as o-dog\\'s cynicism and brutality . \\nhis performance sells the movie . \\ninterestingly , as tate moves from his usual street-smart roles to youthful optimism , the soft-eyed patton , who usually plays nice guys , proves a disarming villain . \\nolivia williams makes her film debut as the postman\\'s love interest , abby . \\nwhen they first meet , abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile . \\npredictably , the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits , and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero . \\nhowever , their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored ( she , torn by grief , guilt , and anger ; he , resisting his destiny ) . \\n \" the postman \" is costner\\'s best work thus far . \\nperhaps that alone gives us hope for the future . \\n . \\n . \\n',\n"," b'the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film \" the world is not enough \" is its final frame : white letters on a black background proclaiming \" james bond will return . \" \\noh i certainly hope not . \\nwith pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go-round as james bond 007 , \" the world is not enough \" is the best example to date that \" \\'enough \" is enough . \\nin this , the 19th chapter in the seemingly-endless franchise featuring ian fleming\\'s debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis--and his nemeses--shaken not stirred , the sub-inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups , stunts , and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original . \\nwe\\'ve got previously-used speedboat chases , ski chases , and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines . \\nwe\\'ve got a couple of hot-to-trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them . \\nwe\\'ve got a post-cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction ( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean , lean panache ) . \\nand , as has been the case since 1977\\'s \" the spy who loved me , \" we\\'ve got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr . fleming . \\nwe\\'ve also got a main title song by garbage to which , with very little effort , you can fit the lyrics to * both * songs from \" tomorrow never dies . \" \\nwhile originality was never the series\\' strong suit , the films were almost always fun , with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts . \\ni can\\'t think of one memorable set-piece in the entire--and very dull-- \" the world is not enough . \" \\nin addition , michael apted ( yes , the respected director of such films as \" coal miner\\'s daughter , \" \" nell , \" and the \" 28up \" documentary series ) takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich ? s . \\nyou get the \" talking killer \" plot device--you know the scenario : the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age . \\nand you get a slew of high-priced assassins who can\\'t hit a barn door at 20 paces : in the film\\'s opening minutes ( of an endless 128 ) , bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leather-clad lovely fails to hit bond\\'s souped-up \" fishing boat \" with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her . \\nlater , she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out . \\nthese reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles , vodka , or credit cards . \\nin and among the rampant product placements , brosnan grapples with carlyle , \" braveheart \" \\'s sophie marceau ( as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king ; she\\'s terrible ) , \" wild things \" \\' denise richards ( as a nuclear physicist lord help me ; she\\'s laughable ) , and judi dench as m . dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its self-respect ( about the time roger moore inherited bond\\'s walther ppk ) . \\nbrosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm you\\'d expect of the former \" remington steele \" star , but even he has to be thinking there\\'s more to life than an easy paycheck . \\nhe\\'s given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver , but only one of them-- \" i don\\'t know any doctor jokes \" --made me chuckle ( although \" i thought christmas only comes once a year \" is more in keeping with the series\\' penchant for grown-worthy puns ) . \\n',\n"," b'plot : set in the future , a courier has uploaded some data into a \" hard drive \" that resides in his head , and

a hilarious ending . \\nit\\'s too bad because the premise of the film was interesting , but unfortunately for my friends and i , this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us . \\nit\\'s one of those films that makes you start laughing half-way through , when you realize that most of the actors in it suck , the location shots are filmed in dark \" junkyard \" type areas

include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass , henry rollins as a pumped-up cyber-doctor or something , and ice-t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face ( don\\'t ask ) . \\nthe ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost-lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no one really cares about by that point . \\ni\\'m ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal , canada , but sadly enough for us all , it was . \\nsome of the cyber-travelling special effects were okay ( hence , the 2/10 ) ,

plaudits bestowed upon pam grier , who likewise returned from out of obscurity to appear in another recent elmore leonard adaptation , \" jackie brown , \" but it is intriguing to see her name kicking off the \" also starring \" credits given her limited screen time . \\nthe real stars of \" out of sight \" are george clooney ( \" batman & robin \" by way of \" e . r . \" ) and jennifer lopez ( \"

) and nearly all of its original charm . \\ndan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self-proclaimed \" mission from god \" along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago . \\nas we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother\\'s death in prison years ago . \\ncompletely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away . \\nbut elwood isn\\'t completely without family . \\nit seems he has a half-brother of sorts - not a real brother mind you , just the illegitimate child of his bluesman

while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story . \\nonly the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours . \\nfor those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing . \\nappearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors . \\nblues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star

( 1903 ) was the first western ever made and \" jesse james under the black flag \" ( 1923 ) first introduced the outlaw folk hero . \\nnow , more than 20 similarly-themed pictures later , jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend . \\nthe story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , cole and scott younger ( scott caan , will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ) , after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war , return to liberty , missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown . \\nand an avaricious east coast railroad baron , thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) , is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value , aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who , back then , were just thugs who provided security . \\nbut when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims , jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith , ty o\\'neal , joe stevens ) form the james-younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad\\'s supply lines , sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept . \\nplus there\\'s romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal , lee mimms ( ali larter ) . \\nworking from a politically-correct , clich ? -drenched , sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers , director les mayfield keeps the action fast-paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can . \\nthe choppy editing hurts but russell boyd\\'s cinematography , luke reichle\\'s designer duds and trevor rabin\\'s music lend authenticity . \\non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" american outlaws \" is a galloping , formulaic 3 .

created evil bats . \\nalright folks , stop me if you\\'ve heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal\\'s field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth . \\noh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time . \\nsound familiar ? \\nsuch is the plot of the destination films release of bats . \\ndina meyer stars as the \" bat specialist \" sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently . \\nwith the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton\\'s character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! ) . \\ni have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film . \\nthere\\'s not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good . \\nin this respect , the film never disappointed me . \\nthis film reaches a level that transcends the \" so bad it\\'s good \" level and borders on the downright insane . \\nthe effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) . \\ni challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face . \\nthankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with . \\ndina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . . \\nthe latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception . \\nwhile one never really gets the impression that meyer\\'s character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either . \\nshe gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she\\'s nice to look at for an hour and a half . \\nlou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero . \\nalthough when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what\\'s going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats . \\nthe only bad performance in the film is that of leon\\'s . \\nhe is relegated to the \" i\\'m not sticking around here ! \" \\ncharacter and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . \\nanyone who can\\'t immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . \\neven if he hadn\\'t been the villain in just about every film he\\'s ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . \\nin fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . \\nif the plot doesn\\'t sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . \\nan entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor\\'s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . \\na government official blows off shelia\\'s instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats\\' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . \\na cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . \\nfinally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it\\'s single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we\\'re lucky to even get kevin smith\\'s dogma ) . \\nthe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets . \\nwhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what\\'s going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key . \\ntherefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . \\nbeing able to see the puppeteer\\'s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . \\nafter all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don\\'t say you haven\\'t been warned . \\ntrust me when i say that it\\'s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . \\ni just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . \\nshe\\'s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these . \\n',\n"," b'wizards is an animated

\\nthe twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire . \\nwe are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology . \\nas unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out . \\nthere\\'s a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all . \\ni soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film . \\nonce the transition was made from still art to color

mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk boing \\nfor years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited

you know it , there are dead elves everywhere . \\nthis is just as well . \\nthe characters are so bad that the viewer doesn\\'t care about any of them . \\nthey\\'re either silly , sappy , or both . \\nthe dialog gets much of the credit for this . \\nan example is when avatar nonchalantly says , \" well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . \" \\nnot very formidable when he\\'s also the guy who says , \" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i\\'ve ever been on . \" \\nmy favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can\\'t fight back against the nazi-charged evil . \\nher response is , \" they have weapons and technology . \\nwe just have love . \" \\nsuffice to say , the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don\\'t expect anything more than the obvious to happen . \\nwhich it does . \\nthe only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing . \\nplease note that it is the action that is unexpected . \\nthat it is disappointing is not . \\nthe film couldn\\'t settle on a particular mood . \\nit seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle . \\nscenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity . \\nthe dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned . \\nralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad . \\nso who doesn\\'t know this already ? \\nwell , maybe children . \\nokay , so you might say that this is a movie for children . \\nit\\'s not . \\nin the scenes where good fights evil , there\\'s a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they\\'re watching a cartoon . \\nso is the film for adults ? \\nif so , we probably don\\'t need to be bashed over the head to get the point . \\nwhy not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ? \\nwizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes , and hitler giving speeches . \\nhowever , we don\\'t see any reason why they should be considered bad . \\nwe see no atrocities being committed , not even any real battle footage . \\nthere is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich , and we\\'re not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place . \\nthis needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment . \\ni\\'d like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere , at any time , and we must therefore be vigilant . \\nhowever , i\\'m not sure if i want to give him that much credit . \\n',\n"," b'tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance , and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered marketing materials for crap movies . \\nand here he hits rock bottom , with planet of the apes . \\ni didn\\'t expect much from this latest \" interpretation \" of pierre boulle\\'s classic novel planet of the apes . \\ni mean , how could you top the force and impact of the original film , intelligently co-scripted by rod serling ( of twilight zone fame ) combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those \" damn dirty apes , \" in one of his best roles of his career ? \\nsadly , i sat down to watch burton\\'s version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes , i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off . \\nthis time around , the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine , braveheart , and project x . marky mark wahlberg , who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter , plays leo davidson , a hot shot u . s . air force pilot . \\nleo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms ( no real explanation given in the film ) and leo sends one of his genetically altered \" smart \" chimps into the storms to collect data . \\nleo and his crew lose communication with the chimp , leo hops in another ship to find the monkey , and then he\\'s thrown through some type of time-space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot , all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle . \\nleo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter ) . \\nthe kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo\\'s ship . \\nalong the way , monkeys played by tim roth ( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade ) and michael clarke duncan ( who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie ) strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages , just like battlefield earth ! \\nin the end , it all culminates into another braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene . \\nwhile rick baker\\'s makeup work is amazing , the script is a pathetic hodgepodge ( courtesy of three writers ) , the acting is horrible , and the \" surprise \" ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple . \\nwahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences . \\nthis remake , or re-interpretation , as tim burton has proclaimed it , is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film . \\nthe ethical arguments about the equality of species , fascism , and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue , an unimaginative narrative structure , and a romance between a monkey and a human . \\neven chuck heston\\'s anti-gun tirade ( in the de rigeur cameo ) seems shallow and jokey . \\nbut the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton . \\neven though his name is plastered across every billboard in america , john badham could have directed this film . \\neven joel schumacher could have directed this film . \\nhe probably should have . \\nburton\\'s predominant themes of rejection , isolation , and the search for one\\'s place in the universe , as seen in ed wood , edward scissorshands , and pee-wee\\'s big adventure , are completely absent in this planet . \\ni

beautiful pictures made by danish artist per kirkeby , accompanied by music from the era ; procol harum , deep purple , t-rex and others . \\nthe use of hand-held camera and lack of any make-up make the characters solid and help to separate this movie from others in the sentimental genre . \\nthe incredible performance from the actors makes the movie brilliant , though a bit too gloomy for my taste . \\ni would say that it is in the genre of betty blue ( 37 . 2 le matin ) and bitter moon ( lunes de fiel ) . \\nemily watson as bess and katrin cartlidge as her best friend dodo deliver outstanding performances , this must be the reason for giving it the \" grand prix du jury \" in cannes this year ( although we had hoped for the \" palme d\\'or \" ) . \\nthe screenplay is now

. \\n \" the sculptress \" is a scary proposition all right , but not in the way its producers intended . \\nfrom the outset it\\'s easy to see why some of the larger , more reputable chains aren\\'t carrying it : the film looks like a straight-to-video release from the early \\'80s that\\'s been dusted off ( not very carefully ) and re-issued in theatrical format . \\nthat staple of schlocky z-movies jeff fahey ( \" the lawnmower man \" ) plays a washed-up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills . \\nwhen he\\'s not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment , screaming scotch-induced \" hamlet \" soliloquies well into the night , he\\'s out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women . \\nfahey\\'s dobie sizes up his victims ( actually just one , a peep show performer name of sylvie ) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk , and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane , dark glasses , and a false beard ( just in time for halloween ! ) . \\n \" do you have a castle ? \" \\nsylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop . \\n \" jah . \\nwith ze many turrets \" is dobie\\'s perplexing reply . \\nthe real \" star \" of the film ( and i use that term extremely loosely ) is katie wright , who plays the sculptress of the title . \\nsarah is new in town , studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a \" genius \" frenchman , played by the beret-wearing patrick bauchau . \\nthat\\'s convenient , because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris ( you won\\'t believe the film\\'s final shot , with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop and \" rosemary\\'s baby \" -inspired imagery ) . \\nbauchau\\'s character criticizes sarah\\'s work publicly ( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles--perhaps she\\'s possessed . . . \\nby an incubus ! ! ? ) but he still manages to talk her into dinner . \\nwhereas wright does a decent english accent , her talents pretty much end there . \\non the other side of the wall , dobie\\'s troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like \" actor delivers a stunning macbeth , \" actor courted by hollywood studio , \" \" actor renounces hollywood for priesthood , \" and \" prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal . \" \\nthe film\\'s plot could have been just as easily condensed . \\n \" artist moves in next door to shakespearean

dawson\\'s creek . \\nfollowing in the foot steps of mtv\\'s two other live action films , joe\\'s apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace . \\nset in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john \" mox \" moxon ( van der beek ) . \\nwe know he\\'s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook . \\ncoach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him . \\nthe star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) . \\nalso on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin . \\nwhen lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies . \\nhis relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there\\'s a big game at the end . \\nguess who wins ? \\nnothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love . \\nthere\\'s a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow . \\nvan der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes . \\nalso , the role isn\\'t very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character . \\nhe\\'s still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock . \\nvoight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out . \\nthe other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don\\'t fare much better . \\non the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) . \\nscott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team\\'s wild man . \\nlarter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film\\'s most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening \" whipped cream bikini . \" \\nit\\'s interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) . \\nall this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson\\'s creek , presumably the target audience for the picture . \\ndirector brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression . \\nthe look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it . \\nthe football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out . \\nthere\\'s an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it\\'s not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film . \\n',\n"," b'anyone who saw alan rickman\\'s finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart . \\nhowever , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock . \\nnevertheless , \" poetic \" is an excellent term to describe rickman\\'s feature debut as a director , the winter guest . \\nthe film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole . \\nthe result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama . \\nthe winter guest isn\\'t about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it\\'s about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages . \\nthe winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end . \\ninstead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans . \\nthey represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin . \\nwe see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled . \\nthere is comedy and tragedy . \\nmost importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth . \\nthe setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year . \\nit\\'s so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over . \\nthe onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance . \\nit is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured . \\nthere are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest\\'s focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship . \\nthe first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) . \\nthese two have a stormy relationship . \\nthey love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other . \\nmuch of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other . \\nfrances\\' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father . \\non this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks . \\nalthough their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction . \\nonce they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don\\'t go exactly as planned . \\nlily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees . \\ndeath is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area . \\nit doesn\\'t matter whether or not they knew the deceased . \\nit\\'s the ceremony that they\\'re interested in . \\nsam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water . \\nunlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them . \\nthey are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience . \\nthe acting is strong and believable . \\nthe mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles . \\nthere is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors . \\nand , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child . \\nthe winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director . \\nfour of the film\\'s principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film . \\nunlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up . \\nthe rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans . \\nin fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman\\'s microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie . \\nif you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater . \\n',\n"," b'you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . \\nwhile watching instinct , i couldn\\'t help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . \\neven beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn\\'t a very good film . \\nit\\'s painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly . \\ni didn\\'t hate it -- it\\'s simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . \\nbut i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . \\ni can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it\\'s pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . \\nthings start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . \\ncaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . \\nthe subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . \\npowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it\\'s now caulder\\'s job to find out of he\\'s mentally competent enough to stand trial . \\nthrough a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . \\neven though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . \\nas i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he\\'s on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he\\'s not acting , that he\\'s actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . \\nthe character himself isn\\'t very interesting -- he\\'s just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . \\ngooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . \\nthe screenplay , written by gerald di pego and \" suggested by \" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he\\'s obsessed with his work ) . \\nnonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . \\nunfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . \\nturtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct\\'s artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . \\nfirst , we have the prison warden subplot . \\nthe prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder\\'s progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that\\'s fine . \\nthere\\'s also the prison guard subplot . \\nthe prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he\\'s instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . \\nthen there\\'s the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . \\nif some of this stuff sounds familiar , that\\'s because they\\'re all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . \\nthe evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . \\nthe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest had . \\nashton\\'s evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown\\'s in the shawshank redemption . \\nhopkins\\' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . \\nand then there\\'s the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . \\nperhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . \\nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are \" takers , \" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . \\ni can sympathize with that , but only when it\\'s in a compelling film . \\nthis is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . \\nwhat does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? \\nif all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . \\nif the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn\\'t rely on the strength of its actors . \\n',\n"," b'it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film . \\nthey seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like . \\n ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . ) \\nthey also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user\\'s answer to deep impact . \\nbruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond \" zero barrier \" and destroys our planet . \\nwhy an oil driller ? \\nthey require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid . \\n ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) \\nhilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . \\nwe trust nasa to build space shuttles ? ) \\nharry assembles the obligatory \" ragtag \" bunch of \" cowboys \" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . \\nonce they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . \\nwhether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . \\nnor will you care . \\ni will say this : you know you\\'re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . \\nwillis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . \\ntheir big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material . \\nsteve buscemi\\'s character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . \\n \" rockhound \" , as he\\'s called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . \\nso why did they bring him up there to begin with ? \\nrather , why write him into the film ? -give \\nhis almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . \\ni\\'m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . \\nliv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father\\'s band\\'s ( \" aerosmith \" ) songs grace the soundtrack . \\ndirector michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . \\n ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate\\'s brain . ) \\nwhenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out \" we lost ( insert dead person\\'s last name here ) ! \" \\ni must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses\\' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . \\narmageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . \\nit looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . \\nit has a vivid soundmix . \\nbut at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . \\nthe love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . \\nbollocks ! \\nthe lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . \\nremember a little film called jaws ? \\nin this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . \\nthey didn\\'t much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . \\none of jaws\\' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . \\nthis is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we\\'ll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . \\nnot once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i\\'d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before \" action \" was called . \\na male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don\\'t bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . \\nto this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn\\'t build a birdhouse . \\nand if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i\\'ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life . \\n',\n"," b'three things i learned from \" being john malkovich \" : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don\\'t stand in the way of your wife\\'s actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it\\'s muddy in there . \\n \" being john malkovich \" is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time . \\nwildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head . \\nafter savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it . \\nfrom the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there\\'s a lot to think about here . \\njust don\\'t forget to have fun . \\nclearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman . \\n \" i wrote \\'being john malkovich\\' without an outline , \" he explains in the press notes , \" blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose . \\nit\\'s important to me that i don\\'t have a map before i start . \\nthis allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface . \" \\nspike jonze ( mark wahlberg\\'s na ? ve buddy in \" three kings \" ) takes it from there . \\nthe white-hot director of the beastie boy\\'s \" sabotage , \" an award-winning parody of \\'70s tv cop shows , as well as numerous other music videos and commercials , eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut . \\njonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style . \\nhis flat , matter-of-fact approach works perfectly . \\nand then there\\'s the cast . \\njohn cusack plays control freak craig schwartz , a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive , but decidedly erotic puppet shows . \\nover the years , his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte ( cameron diaz ) has devolved . \\nonce passionate lovers , the two are now little more than courteous roommates . \\nfinancially strapped , craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk at lestercorp , located on the 7 1/2th floor of a manhattan building . \\nnavigating around dr . lester ( orson bean ) , his 105 year-old boss and floris ( mary kay place ) , lester\\'s dotty secretary , craig tries to settle into his new position , but two things keep him distracted . \\nfirst , there\\'s the beautiful and imperious maxine ( catherine keener ) , who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her . \\nand then there\\'s the hole behind the file cabinet , which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich . \\ncraig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich , where they can experience life from his point of view ( with enough concentration , you can even influence his actions ) . \\nafter 15 minutes , the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike . \\nthen things get a little weird . \\nby the way , if you\\'re concerned that i gave away too much of the plot , rest assured - - i barely scratched the surface . \\none of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up . \\ninstead , he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich , rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another person\\'s identity . \\nhe also examines the consequences of the malko-visits to craig , lotte , maxine and , of course , john malkovich himself . \\nthe performances are superb . \\nmalkovich ( best known to mainstream audiences for his work in \" dangerous liaisons , \" \" in the line of fire , \" and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasure \" con air \" ) tweaks his own image in a dandy self-deprecating turn . \\nfar from his effete , vaguely reptilian persona , this malkovich is just another schlub , drinking with his pals and trying to get laid ( incidentally , charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well-earned bad boy reputation ) . \\nas always , john cusack nails his part , handily pulling viewers along even as craig\\'s actions become unconscionable . \\nthe big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz , both playing against type . \\nkenner , usually cast in icy subordinate roles , is terrific as a highly intelligent , extremely manipulative femme fatale . \\ncameron diaz , barely recognizable under a mess of brown , curly hair , sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich . \\n \" being john malkovich \" stumbles towards the end , as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots . \\nadditional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale . \\nregardless , this contemporary \" alice in wonderland \" is a real treat . \\ni enjoyed watching \" being john malkovich , \" but only later , after reflecting on the film , did its resonance fully hit me . \\nat one point , craig says , \" do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is ? \" \\ntruer words were never spoken . \\n',\n"," b\"my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies . \\nwe are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills , the corny dialog , the ludicrous premises and the bad acting . \\nsince other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment , we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together . \\ni can't remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along . \\nhe was not amused . \\ni on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained . \\nperhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity . \\ni on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft . \\nthe movie could have been better if it were not so brusque . \\nthis movie slaps you with conception , pregnancy , delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames , without pausing for infancy . \\nthe producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman's womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm , and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean . \\nan autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone , to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect . \\nin a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed . \\nthe opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good . \\nthe writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets' . \\nas the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck . \\neve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil , the original alien sexual predator , but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated , which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner . \\nin a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet . ' \\nit's enough to melt the most callous heart . \\nat another point she protests : `i'm human too , you know . ' \\nshe is only half right . \\npeter medak , the director , knows his business . \\njustin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials . \\njames cromwell , his father , is perfect in a short role . \\nmarg heldenberger , the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful . \\nnatasha is an exquisite ornament . \\ngeorge dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up . \\nmichael madsen was there . \\nblack buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits , which is more that we can say for lazard . . \\n\",\n"," b\"best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . \\nusually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . \\nif you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda . \\ncox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . \\nbig john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . \\nwhat bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . \\nhe's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) \\nhe'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . \\nl . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . \\nfilmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . \\nin his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . \\nhighway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . \\nhe's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do . \\nthis makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . ) \\nl . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven . \\nthere is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . \\nrather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . \\nconcurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . \\ncox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . \\ndano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . \\nwe're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . \\nthe restraint is admirable . \\nbut l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material . \\nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \\ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations . \\nit's too much . \\nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \\nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \\nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \\nit's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \\nin this regard , l . i . e . \\n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \\nhow often does real life work this way ? \\nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism ,

to what he has to say even though he\\'s got a bad reputation . \\nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . \\nhe tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn\\'t seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . \\nfor example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there\\'s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . \\nthis angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . \\n \" do we have ammunition factories ? \\ndo we have food ? \\ndo we have a navy ? \\nall we have is tobacco . \" \\nall true statements and yet the south still insists he\\'s wrong . \\nbutler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it\\'s appealing . \\nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he\\'s not going to stop until he has her . \\nbut scarlett can\\'t get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . \\nand so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . \\nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is \" marked \" for life when her first husband dies . \\nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . \\nsome are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . \\nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . \\neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . \\nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . \\nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . \\nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . \\nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . \\none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , \" no ! \\nnot my leg ! \\ndon\\'t cut off my leg ! \" \\nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that\\'s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . \\nas the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . \\nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can\\'t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south\\'s ultimate defeat . \\nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . \\nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . \\neach uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . \\nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can\\'t help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . \\nthey say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . \\nthey need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . \\nperhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . \\nboth have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . \\nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we\\'re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . \\ngable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . \\nall ? \\nnone ? \\neither way is possible and it\\'s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings . \\nit\\'s safe to say most of us won\\'t live such overly dramatic lives as those in \" gone with the wind , \" but it\\'s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we\\'ve just experienced a life\\'s worth of joy and pain . \\n',\n"," b'when i first heard that disney\\'s next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified . \\ni was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) . \\nthat effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation . \\nwhen i saw the trailers , i was thinking \" hmm . . . \\nthis isn\\'t bad at all . \\nthis just might have potential . \" \\nwhen i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features . \\ni have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ? \\ni was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch . \\nphil collins\\' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs . \\nthe score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original . \\nso , the soundtrack wasn\\'t bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with . \\nthis film could be good . . . \\nbut will it be ? \\nwhen i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney\\'s tarzan is surprisingly decent . \\nthe story starts out with tarzan\\'s parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace . \\nhowever , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan\\'s parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him . \\nkala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure . \\n \" it\\'s not our kind , \" he says . \\nhe agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but \" that doesn\\'t make him my son . \" \\ntarzan grows up , vowing to be \" the best ape ever \" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can\\'t convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle . \\none day , a new animal shows up : humans . \\nthis is where jane comes into the picture . \\nshe is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas . \\ntarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other . \\neven though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong . \\nclayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them . \\nworse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money . \\nwill tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ? \\ni\\'m not gonna tell you , sorry . \\nyou\\'re gonna have to see for yourself . \\nand see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) . \\nthe deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in . \\nin fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox\\'s anastasia and dreamworks\\' prince of egypt . \\ncould it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ? \\nthe casting is fairly good . \\ntony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules . \\nnicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) . \\nlance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson\\'s beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping . \\nminnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane . \\ni thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn\\'t have a problem with her . \\ni take back my insult on driver . \\nit\\'s nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney\\'s most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter . \\non the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton . \\nhe might not be the strongest character in the film ( he\\'s just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed\\'s vocal work contributes greatly . \\nbut if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o\\'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk . \\nshe also has a fiesty attitude ( \" i\\'m gonna kill ya ! \" \\nshe says , more than once ) . \\ni almost sung along with her during one of the film\\'s best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human\\'s camp , via song , er , scatting \" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah \" . \\ni can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she\\'s a good singer . \\nnot that she was the only funny character in the film , though . \\nwayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into \" un-sanitary \" water . \\n ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) . \\nthe songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins . \\nthis sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing . \\ni tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace . \\nthe story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules . \\nif there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the \\'n sync version of \" trashing the camp \" from the film . \\ni heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be . \\ni was upset that it wasn\\'t , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like \\'n sync to see tarzan . \\noh , well . . . \\noverall , i was enthralled with tarzan . \\ni wouldn\\'t hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney\\'s greatest achievements . \\ni give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough\\'s tarzan . \\n',\n"," b\"well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you . \\nbecause thats all that there really is . . . . \\ni found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot . \\nfor one thing , a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity . . . . \\ni am not saying that this isn't possible . . \\nbut it does leave one to wonder . . . i \\nknow i did . \\nanother thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out . . . . \\nand certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations . \\nthere was one scene that should have been short . . . \\nbut it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking . . \\nok enough already get on with it . \\nthere are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do . . . \\nthings just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort . . . \\nanother thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning . \\nthis movie is also very predictable . . . \\nyou can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment . . \\ngranted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you . \\nalso some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated . . . \\nit gets boring at times to tell you the truth . . . \\neven though there is still action going on . \\nanother little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero . \\nsome of the characters are not proper for their roles . \\nthe acting is fine but the characters just don't seem to add up . \\nif i was to base my review totally on the plot then i wouldn't rate this movie too highly but that's just the thing this movie isn't just the plot , its the whole package and this package is really well done . \\nthe whole movie is really well done and looks really good and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot and characters then this is really a movie . \\nthe special effects are just amazing , you can't tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks like they were there live , in a few instances of course you know its fake but there are other times that you just wouldn't be able to say that the creature wasn't there during filming , extinct or not . \\nanother thing is the destruction scenes . . . \\nwow , those were masterpieces . . \\nwell some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino's make this one of the reasons to see this movie . \\nthis movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office . . \\nunfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do . . \\ni may be too cynical for my age but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects and for it few funny moments . . \\ngo see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me . \\none little side note , although my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid , there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some people really want money badly . . . . \\nand i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance . . . . \\nyou know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made . . . . . \\ni thought i'd put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick . . . \\nits not that bad a movie but its not that great either hope you people realize this . \\n\",\n"," b'wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles . \\nmurder at 1600 , u . s . marshals , money train , drop zone , boiling point , and the ultimate camp film - passenger 57 . \\nthe art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category . \\nultimately , it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report , ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe , and terrible acting by b-list actors like michael biehn and anne archer . \\noddly , it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes \" masterpiece , \" rising sun . \\nthe movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador , the chinese triad brotherhood , a rich chinese businessman ( played by ? that bad guy from rising sun , cary-hiroyuki tagawa ) a chinese un interpreter , and , inexplicably , donald sutherland . \\nthe film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island . \\nor should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo\\'s hong kong films combined . \\ni am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film . \\ni usually enjoy snipes\\' movies - though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films . \\nsimply , i am amazed by the how inane the script was , filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences . \\ndirector christian duguay ( screamers ) has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts -- showing splattering brains , people impaled with broken shards of glass , and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere . \\nit also sickens me to know that oliver stone , one of the greatest directors working today , had his hand in producing this monstrosity . \\ni guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script , watch the dailies , be involved in casting , or anything else -- or else he\\'d be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits . \\nit\\'s also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese . \\ni\\'m sure over the next couple of months , even more \" chinese conspiracy/martial-arts action flicks \" are going to be popping up in your local multiplex . \\nhopefully they won\\'t include wesley snipes . \\n',\n"," b\"it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens . \\nhowever , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill . \\nin his live-action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture . \\nthe story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps . \\npeter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation . \\nevery day in his mundane life is worse than the one before . . . in \\nother words , every day is the worst day in his entire life . \\nhe's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities . \\nhe's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but hasn't the guts to even introduce himself . \\neverything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck . \\nbut all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over-effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions . \\nhe realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing . \\nhe begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like . \\npeter's friends and co-workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . . no , \\nnot that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend's sudden change in attitude . \\nbut , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . . \\nas bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one . \\nalthough it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life . \\neach mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible . \\nyet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal . \\nron livingston tackles his role straight-faced , and becomes much funnier because of it . \\nhis character isn't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen-like clarity . \\nhe is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life . \\nanyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film . \\nin fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic . \\nthe animated roots of office space show in the film's lack of complexity . \\nmost of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk . \\none employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh-and-blood cartoon . \\nhowever , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny . \\nit's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far-fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) . \\nthe film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny . \\n\",\n"," b\"don't let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare . \\nno one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work , and this movie makes a vain attempt at that . \\nany moves to ? glamorise' his life , which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do , will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness . \\nthis movie about his life , although well written , puts too much make-up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes , rather than lobster and champagne . \\noh well , let's fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play-write , who falls in love with a beautiful woman ( gwyneth paltrow ) and from her inspiration , several plays develop - ? romeo and juliet' , and ? the twelfth night' . \\nit is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that's how all his plays develop , but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama . \\nbut i guess my version probably wouldn't draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen . \\nso is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare , when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul . \\ni think not . \\nas for the oscars were they deserved by this movie ? \\ni think not . \\nin many aspects ? private ryan' and ? life is beautiful' were far superior movies , but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar , as time and again , for reasons unexplained , an undeserving movie will win the accolade . \\nanother sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead , over a more polished cate , but i

\\nhe has had his typical action movies , \" boiling point \" , \" passenger 57 \" , but his new movie \" the art of war \" should just be called \" rising sun 2 : the art of war \" cause basically it\\'s a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller , that is high on style and low on substance . \\nwesley snipes plays a james

, kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way . \\nall this leads to a finale that is so dumb , and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb , and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie . \\nwesley snipes isn\\'t one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays in the movie before . \\nthe only good role snipes has really had was in 1998\\'s \" blade \" . \\ni walked into \" the art of war \" expecting a good , high octane thriller , and all i got was a pile of mush . \\nthe only real \\'good\\' thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it , but i noticed it is badly filmed , the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on . \\nthe ending finale is so worthless and pitiful , that it even tries to mock \" the matrix \" , laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid . \\nchristian duguay\\'s direction is also not that great . \\nhis camera angles and sense of style are all in place , but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done . \\neven the whole \" matrix \" ending wasn\\'t even good . \\nthe stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed . \\nhis placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassador , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable , that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie . \\nanne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here . \\nshe is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves . \\neven donald sutherland as a co-star can\\'t save this movie from being a bust . \\nso for an overall opinion : \" the art of war \" is a total waste of time . \\nit\\'s not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed . \\nit is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all . \\nif you really want to see a good version of \" the art of war \" , rent the wesley snipes and

able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation . \\nas usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again . \\nthis time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist's will . \\nit turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists . \\nof course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists . \\ninsurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films . \\nthe film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group . \\nin this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction . \\nit doesn't do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line . \\nmany of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat . \\nthe other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . \\nthere are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ? \\nthe explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen . \\nso the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible . \\nbut in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever . \\nthe other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon . \\nworf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films . \\nno problem so far . \\nworf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up . \\nin the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie . \\nwhat little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren't hanging on every word on the screen . \\nmy minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones . \\nwhile many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non-trekkies . \\nthe special effects are among the best for the star trek series . \\nthe action is plentiful and well done . \\nthis is a very good-looking movie . \\nit should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate . \\nit is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade . \\nthey interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster . \\nmost star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series . \\nif you've always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change

charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . \\nsadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver . \\nand not a particularly good one at that . \\nwhat went wrong ? \\nmi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it\\'ll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise\\'s firing gun just so they can die really cool . \\nearly on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . \\nin one

sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . \\nprior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . \\nwhy ? \\ni haven\\'t the foggiest . \\ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical

vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . \\nbetween the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . \\nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . \\nsure it\\'s all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . \\nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that\\'s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \\\\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . \\nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . \\nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously . \\ncruise grins a little too slyly . \\nthe cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . \\nhere cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . \\nhe\\'s cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90\\'s ) . \\nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise\\'s initial \" i\\'m the man ! \" \\ncharm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . \\nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won\\'t stop . \\nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could\\'ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the \" symbolic \" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . \\nwe\\'ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . \\nit isn\\'t done any differently here . \\nthe action is pure hard target \\\\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . \\nhe\\'s cool for sure but he\\'s made to be as empty as the movie . \\nthe actor isn\\'t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . \\nwhen he\\'s not beaming away , he\\'s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo\\'s editing seriously undermines the effort . \\nhe fetishizes cruise\\'s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . \\ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he\\'s really austin powers . \\nin a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . \\nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . \\nthe lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles . \\nthough instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a \" so you thought i was dead . . . \" . \\nnot to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat . \\nwhat a hero ! \\nyou may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2\\'s plot . \\nmy reasoning is simple : i\\'m not sure of any good it would do . \\nthe film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next \" special \" effect . \\ni wasn\\'t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . \\nnobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they\\'ll surely regret it . \\nas summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . \\nin mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma\\'s ( that film\\'s director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo\\'s non-stop masturbatory pandemonium . \\nit\\'s irrelevant in every sense , as is character . \\nall that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors . \\n',\n"," b\"ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church \\nsynopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy . \\nin a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids . \\nto atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station . \\nsoon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple . \\nbut sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him . \\nopinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms . \\ni believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film . \\nduvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs . \\nincidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway . \\nsince no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) . \\nin terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film . \\nsimilarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience . \\non the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience . \\nin terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone . \\nteenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church . \\nin other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience . \\n\",\n"," b'fritz lang\\'s first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town . \\njoe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago . \\nhe is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can\\'t save up enough money to marry her . \\nshe takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher . \\nbefore she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye . \\na year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station . \\ndriving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand . \\nbut the deputy sheriff \" buggs \" meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him . \\nhe accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl . \\nthe sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect . \\nlocked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence . \\nin the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping . \\nfueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can\\'t get through to the prisoner\\'s jail cell . \\nthe sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn\\'t look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him . \\nsomehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies . \\nkatherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died . \\nthe next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses . \\njoe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge . \\nhe thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob . \\nan ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder . \\nkatherine , not knowing he\\'s alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death . \\nthe defense claims that it can\\'t be a charge of murder without a corpse . \\nthe trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn\\'t have been at the jail . \\nthe sheriff also lies , saying he can\\'t identify anyone in the mob . \\nbut proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film . \\nas for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe . \\nin the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive . \\nwhen the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened . \\nkatherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have . \\nbut don\\'t blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive . \\nmgm couldn\\'t bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching . \\ninstead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script . \\nto lang\\'s credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook . \\nhis portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised . \\nyou couldn\\'t help get the feeling that the citizens didn\\'t care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves . \\ntheir reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren\\'t going to be convicted . \\nlang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident . \\nhe does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience . \\n',\n"," b'synopsis : easily-angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce . \\ndiedre easily cons david\\'s not-so-bright new wife molly into believing she\\'s a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david\\'s quick-tempered son , michael . \\ndiedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people . \\ncomments : the ex is a very bad movie . \\ni haven\\'t seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while . \\ni kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars ) . \\nas summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned-psycho-lover-gets-her-revenge type movie . \\ni\\'m not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000 . \\nthe ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn\\'t take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind ) . \\nthose involved in the movie realize they\\'re in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script . \\nthe ex\\'s storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie . \\ndiedre , david\\'s first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it\\'s not as though she\\'s bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime ) . \\ndavid and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger . \\nthough david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made . \\nmolly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she\\'s a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son . \\ntime and time again , things do not add up in this movie . \\nif a viewer can\\'t accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex . \\nif , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he\\'ll probably like it much better . \\ni don\\'t mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp . \\neven when viewed from an it\\'s-so-bad-it\\'s-good angle , this movie isn\\'t all that successful . \\nthe ex does have its moments , though , almost all of which involve yancy butler ( the psychotic diedre ) and nick mancuso ( david ) . \\nthese two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which , oftentimes , elicit chuckles from the audience . \\nthe truly awful lines written for them help this humor along . \\nbutler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue ; every time her character kills someone , she has a punchline that\\'s unbelievably inane . \\nwhen she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david , for example , diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states \" i\\'m so sorry , your lease is terminated . \" \\nor how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ? \\n ( diedre\\'s therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it\\'s not her\\'s . \\ntherapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies ) . \\nhaving successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : \" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ? \\noh , that\\'s right . \\n\\'i\\'m sorry , but your time is up ! \\' \" \\nthis is what passes for humor in the film . \\nthe audience doesn\\'t necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can\\'t believe they\\'re watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . \\nnick mancuso\\'s chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler\\'s character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . \\nin between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie\\'s best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is . \\nin exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts \" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! \" \\n ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) \\nand so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . \\ni won\\'t reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . \\nmolly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! \\nmolly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family\\'s to spy upon them , that \" she\\'s crazy . \" \\nyou\\'d be pretty crazy too if you\\'d rented this turkey . \\ni\\'d avoid it unless it\\'s on tv and you come across it . \\nif you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn\\'t spend money renting it . \\n',\n"," b'retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 ) \\na film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson \\ni once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as \" dim-witted \" . \\nand by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead . \\nalthough the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them . \\ntwo points in the movie\\'s favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure . \\nand like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction . \\nthe story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts . \\nfor reasons we won\\'t go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth . \\nthe medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) . \\nthat scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ? \\nand don\\'t cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they\\'re buried ? \\nanyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches . \\nfulci\\'s graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight the film\\'s flimsy script and plodding direction . \\nthe dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable . \\nnot bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious \" lets explain the plot \" type approach . \\nmccoll doesn\\'t have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is genuinely hard to watch . \\nand the geezer ( the actor\\'s name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses . \\nchristopher george\\'s performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don\\'t care . \\nin fact we don\\'t care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn\\'t mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond . \\nas a director , some of fulci\\' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here . \\nhe constantly uses extreme close-ups of people\\'s eyes , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren\\'t capable of . \\nand despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film . \\nlong-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that\\'s quite frankly embarrassing . \\nfulci\\'s other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery , the beyond , the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration , atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey . \\nfor completists only . \\n',\n"," b'topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil\\'s advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don\\'t know how to end . \\nit begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other . \\nthere is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz\\'s boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay . \\nfor the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line . \\nthe interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them . \\nat times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives . \\nthis doesn\\'t sound like a brilliant premise for a film - \" we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related \" - but it\\'s the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing . \\nunfortunately this level of honesty isn\\'t maintained . \\nwith about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama . \\nsuch a disappointment after such a brilliant start . \\nthe actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive . \\nthe energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable . \\na lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film . \\nit seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles . \\nthat is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock . \\nup till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place . \\nwhile the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it\\'s unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film . \\nnot just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it . \\nthis is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film . \\nas stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average . \\nit just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss . \\n',\n"," b'airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making . \\nafter all , it\\'s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams . \\neven if most people don\\'t recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few . \\nbut although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! \\nremains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts . \\nin the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high . \\nfilms like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits . \\nthere was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade . \\nand so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film . \\nthis time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . \\n . \\n . \\nit had to do with bad fish . \\nairplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades . \\nunable to stop living in the past , ted\\'s world fell apart . \\nhe spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) . \\nin a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working . \\nunfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity . \\nin the midst of it all , something happens . \\nsomeone gets sick . \\nthen another . \\nthen another . \\nsoon , the whole plane is full of deathly-ill chicago-bound people . \\n . \\n . \\nand when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ? \\n ( gee , i wonder ) \\nof course the main draw here is the non-stop \" whiz-bang \" comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags . \\nalthough i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing . \\nthe most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen . \\nhe\\'s a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film . \\nin a film like this , you\\'re not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can\\'t complain about the amateurish quality . \\nwhat you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker . \\nthis character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny . \\ni don\\'t know why he was put in there , and i don\\'t think anybody will find a good excuse . \\nand when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old . \\nyou gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long . \\naside from that , airplane ! \\nis really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic . \\nit would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven\\'t seen it . \\nand if they ask what the plot is , just tell \\'em \" it\\'s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that\\'s not important right now . \" \\nif you\\'ve seen the film , you\\'ll understand ; - ) \\n',\n"," b\"mugshot ( director/writer/cinematographer/editor : matt mahurin ; cast :

: 87 ; mortal films ; 1995 ) \\nreviewed by dennis schwartz \\na bleak indie film about a stolen identity . \\nthere's not much more to this visually stylish film than what meets the eye , as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging . \\nit falls into the category of being a pretentious art-house film , leaving a bitter taste in one's mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues . \\nit tries to make a heavy-handed point about disenfranchised black youths trapped by their environment , with their only way out being crime . \\nbut the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell , that it's hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean . \\nthe relationship between the black mugger and his white victim is a cloudy one , which the film never determines what it wants to say about it . \\nmatt mahurin is virtual one-man crew in putting this film together ( director/writer /cinematographer/editor ) , who is a still photographer in his day job . \\nthe film works best as a visually challenging piece , as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding . \\na white photographer ( robert knepper ) is mugged by a black gang while he's on a freelance assignment to take a photo shoot of harlem at night . \\nhe becomes a victim of amnesia and his head is bloodied as he's left in a deserted harlem building , as the gang leaves him for dead ; but , one of the muggers , rumor ( michael williams ) , comes back and pretends to help him . \\nhe's a would-be photographer , who keeps a scrapbook entitled mugshots in the project apartment he shares with his mother and younger brother . \\nkeeping his victim in the dark about who he is by calling him joe and not telling him what's happening , he becomes the photographer for a few days . \\nhe enters the photographer's stylish greenwich village apartment and steals his expensive camera , and decides to hold the mugging vic for ransom when he finds out he has a black girlfriend , stella ( belinda becker ) . \\nshe's the only one in the film who could act . \\nthe film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism , as it ends with nothing more to tell after the shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground .

presumably make a good feature . \\nemphasis on the word \" presumably . \" \\n_a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that

soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out \" hotties \" at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts . \\nthere is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak . \\nthat little fact has been used as justification for the film\\'s existence , that the butabis\\' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters . \\nthe doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that\\'s for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends . \\nthere is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots . \\nthe brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club . \\nthere , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously

dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two . \\nthe narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is . \\nthe assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end . \\nalas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film . \\ngranted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film\\'s best joke is completely dependent on one\\'s familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_\\'s lack of inspiration . \\nthat lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves . \\nlike too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , \" the roxbury guys \" is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context . \\nafter watching one of the \" roxbury \" skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to \" what is love ? \" , \\nbump unsuspecting women , and . . . that\\'s all . \\nafter watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you\\'ll be left with exactly the same . \\n',\n"," b'in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can\\'t be longer than a paltry 90 minutes . \\nthis is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter . \\nold friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings . \\nthrough process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand . \\nwhat results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit . \\nafter all , old ned won\\'t miss it . \\nrather than divulge the later twists and turns , i\\'ll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage . \\nbannen and kelly are a perfect pair . \\none slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail . \\nboth getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers . \\nwaking ned devine may even be seen as a \" full monty \" for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff-o for one amusing scene . \\nwaking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films . \\nthe performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads . \\nthere is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture . \\nwriter/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters . \\nscripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception . \\nperhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more . \\nhad i held off on my year\\'s best/worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year\\'s finest films . \\nit is light , but thought provoking and sweet . \\ni can\\'t think of anyone who shouldn\\'t see ( or wouldn\\'t enjoy ) this film . \\n',\n"," b\"warner brothers ; rated pg-13 ( mild violence , sexual situations ) ; 132 minutes \\ndirector : luis mandoki \\nscreenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks ) \\ncast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage . \\nreview by : geoff berkshire \\ni'm not an overly cynical guy . \\nthere have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years . \\nhowever , i have my limits and i also have standards . \\nthis brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine's day . \\nthe story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james ) . \\nduring a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean . \\nthe letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her . \\nupon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it ) . \\nit turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down . \\nhe turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing . \\nthis is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship . \\nof course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love ) . \\nthis way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened . \\nthe discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film . \\nthere's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending . \\na fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel . \\nthe actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since . . . \\nwell , since costner's the postman ( 1997 ) . \\nmessage in a bottle is one slow moving film . \\nlast year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this . \\nthey also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work . \\nmessage in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly . \\ncostner and , especially , wright-penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring . \\nthey also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry . \\nthe supporting players are given very little to do . \\nthe reliable douglas is particularly wasted . \\nold pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film . \\na confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played . \\nhowever , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are . \\nthe film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story . \\ngabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here . \\ncaleb deschanel's camera makes everything look a little too beautiful . \\ndo the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ? \\nthe editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times . \\nthe real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego . \\nworking from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times . \\nits strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) . \\nthere simply isn't an original scene in this film . \\nthe dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking . \\nthis is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance . \\nhe's simply going through the motions with this . \\nmessage in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade . \\n\",\n"," b'when i first saw the previews for ron howard\\'s latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low . \\na show about nothing ? \\nsounds like \" seinfeld . \" \\na guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ? \\nsounds like \" the truman show . \" \\nwhat is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ? \\nwhich is why i was pleasantly surprised by \" edtv , \" which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity . \\nthe writing , by howard\\'s longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus . \\nin the hands of a less-experienced director , \" edtv \" could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday\\'s meatloaf . \\nwith their \\'true tv\\' cable ratings being threatened by \\'the gardening channel\\' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers . \\nprogram director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment . \\nthe hook is to find a regular guy , someone normal that people can relate to . \\nwhile scouting possible candidates , cynthia\\'s camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray ( woody harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame . \\nbut on watching the videotape , the show\\'s producers are more taken with ed than with ray . \\nhe\\'s cute , he says all the wrong things , and he\\'s 100% usda hick . \\ncynthia\\'s boss , played by rob reiner , gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it\\'s tough going in the early stages . \\nthe most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth . \\n \" action shot ! \" \\nwags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster . \\nyou get the idea . \\nbut soon enough , things--nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the \\'true tv\\' cameras are right there to document it . \\ned\\'s privacy is no longer his own , his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life , and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media . \\nwho should ed go out with ? \\nyou can be sure the pollsters have a list . \\nnot only is the film exceedingly well cast , but its performers are consistently excellent . \\nmatthew mcconaughey provides the face , the body language , and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america\\'s latest phenomenon . \\nhe and harrelson look like they really could be brothers . \\nsally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed\\'s mother , and martin landau is one of the film\\'s highlights as al , ed\\'s ailing stepfather . \\njenna elfman ( from tv\\'s \" dharma and greg \" ) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau , although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting . \\neven degeneres and reiner are better than you\\'d expect . \\nin 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called \" real life \" in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time documentary about a typical american family . \\nthe scenes of ed\\'s family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor . \\nas with most films by albert brooks , \" real life \" was funny , but absurd . \\nthe funniest--and scariest--thing about \" edtv \" is that it is absolutely believable . \\n',\n"," b'if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ? \\n \" gattaca \" is a film which presents a future where society has answered \" yes \" to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision . \\n \" gattaca \" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening . \\nthe way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future \" gattaca \" presents becomes true . \\ncontrary to the misleading trailers , \" gattaca \" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there\\'s lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes . \\nthis is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories . \\nin fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who\\'s novel \" brave new world \" featured genetically engineered children ) . \\nit\\'s a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what \" gattaca \" presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much . \\nthe story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years . \\nas a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired . \\nvincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it\\'s as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) . \\nbut one day , he finds out that it\\'s probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( \" wings \" \\' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in \\'97 : \" men in black , \" \" a life less ordinary \" . . . ) , who\\'s client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled . \\nfortunately , though , there\\'s no record of the accident , and he\\'s willing to give someone else his life . \\nsince vincent looks a bit like him . . . \\nafter a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job . \\nthere , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who\\'s genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man\\'s stats are . \\nhowever , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome\\'s eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent\\'s long lost brother , anton , who hasn\\'t seen him since they were teenagers . \\nwe know vincent/jerome didn\\'t do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome\\'s in trouble , but also the real jerome , who\\'s as much in it as he is . \\nhowever , there isn\\'t many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it\\'s message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson . \\nthe suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin . \\nwhile there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences . \\nwhat is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created . \\nirene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people . \\nand the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident . \\nwhat jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it\\'s a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn\\'t have the down ending of other works of this kind . \\nthe production design of this film is probably the best i\\'ve seen this year : it\\'s stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold . \\nsince genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery . \\nand the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life . \\nthe ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy . \\nthe acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child ) . \\nbut the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he\\'s in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden . \\ni think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i\\'m not sure of . \\n \" gattaca \" warns us not to go any farther , chiefly because we\\'ll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy , and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are . \\nand when i see a possible future featuring a 12-fingered piano player , well folks , that just creeps me out . \\n',\n"," b'according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors \" hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness . \" \\nhmm . \\nyou never know , they just might be on to something . \\nwhat with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own . \\nbut then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it . \\nit\\'s cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch . \\nthat\\'s a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more . \\nwoody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson . \\nthe movie opens in the fifties with roy\\'s dad dishing out the reader\\'s digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever . \\nthe sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken . \\nit\\'s thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy . \\nmccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy\\'s hand . \\nthen it\\'s fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand . \\nhe\\'s hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege . \\nso together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way . \\nwith the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that\\'s . . . \\ndumb and dumber . \\nyes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle . \\nso , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen . \\nget set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking . \\nnow , don\\'t get me wrong , there\\'s nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy . \\nthe trouble is that these jokes aren\\'t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction . \\nit lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together . \\nsome gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don\\'t do anything . \\nwhy the long , unfunny fight in the car park ? \\nwhy two of these ? \\nwhy does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ? \\nthe film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , \" wouldn\\'t that be funny ? \" . \\nwell , no , actually . \\nthe actors don\\'t do the movie much favours either . \\nwoody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . . please \\n ) . \\neven murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie\\'s climax . \\nall in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no-hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance . \\nwe\\'ll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( \" strictly bowling \" , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n',\n"," b\"books could be , and indeed have been written about the star wars trilogy , and rightfully so . \\nthis is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s/early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre . \\nthe special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later . \\nliterally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it . \\nand now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy . \\nmuch has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now . \\nsome fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday's star wars updated with today's special effects wizardry . \\neither way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen . \\ncan there be anyone in the world who doesn't know what star wars is about ? \\nin a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . \\nit's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . \\nit's high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it's just an _experience_ . \\nsomething about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and \\nit's about to do so again . \\nthis new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . \\ninterviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html \\nor , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ \\n ) . \\npictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even \\nmonths before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . \\nin some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . \\nthe digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . \\nfor instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . \\nand mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . \\nall the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . \\nfour and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice . \\nhowever , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . \\nthe negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . \\nthe audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . \\nand _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . \\nit's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . \\neven letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition . \\nin regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it . \\ngo and see it more than once . . . it \\nmay be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time . \\ntake along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . \\nthere's magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it's still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . \\nlet's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . \\n\",\n"," b\"meteor threat set to blow away all

seems to get the girl thanks to his 'hard man' nature . \\nvaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner . \\nthe conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach . ) \\nthere are some excellent , laugh out loud jokes in the film , and some superbly funny set pieces ( such as favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence . \\nembarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience . ) \\nmike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them . \\nalthough this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends . \\nthey just seem to wander aimlessly in the background . \\nbut again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts . \\nit's just a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles . \\nthe acting is superb . \\nas said above , vaughn is superb as trent , he's definitely the best thing in the film . \\nfavreau is also good , acting as 'the little man' very well , and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny . \\ngraham ( boogie nights , 1997 ) has a small but good role as lorraine , a girl mike finally falls in love with . \\nshe hardly features in the film at all , but she still manages to make an impact on the audience . \\nswingers , then , is funny , but it does have some flaws . \\nfirstly , the running time is a bit too short . \\nthe film comes to an abrupt halt , and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer . \\nit never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long ! \\nalso , this type of film has been done too many times , such as sleep with me ( 1994 ) . \\nbut these small flaws don't really spoil what is a funny , entertaining comedy . \\n\",\n"," b'magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft . \\nat nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film . \\nit not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions . \\nit is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking . \\nit\\'s also a movie that will polarize its viewers . \\ndirector paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn\\'t let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax . \\nthe character\\'s make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives . \\nthere is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose \" search and destroy \" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants . \\nthere is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son . \\nthere is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public . \\nand there is police officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process . \\ngiven equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h . macy ) . \\na materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) . \\nhovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair . \\nit is not a pleasant movie . \\nthere is not one bad note in the acting . \\nit is affecting and layered and wonderful . \\nthere is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films . \\nthen he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene . \\nwalters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing . \\nrobards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion\\'s roar when he speaks . \\ndirector anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote . \\nthe problem is that he stays on them too long . \\njulianne moore\\'s character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it . \\nafter a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture . \\nquite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around . \\nand just what is the theme ? \\nalienation ? \\nhopelessness ? \\nanderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn\\'t make it easy . \\nthe film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events . \\nit\\'s a harbinger of the synchronicity to come . \\nat times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time . \\nother times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening . \\nanderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film ! \\nwhat\\'s surprising is that it mostly works . \\nif you have doubts about anderson\\'s intentions , i\\'ll ask you to pay attention to the final frame . \\ndespite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man\\'s capacity for hope and attempts at redemption . \\ndespite magnolia\\'s needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts . \\nthis is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling . \\nmy rating : a bulleye . \\n ( stars ) \\na side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann . \\nher lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful . \\nwhen she sings \" save me \" at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as \" wise up \" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives . \\n',\n"," b' \" payback , \" brian helgeland\\'s inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997\\'s \" l . a . confidential \" ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it . \\nmel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( \" conspiracy theory \" and \" lethal weapon 4 , \" anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead . \\nporter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay . \\nthe tagline for \" payback \" is , \" get ready to root for the bad guy , \" and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way . \\ni wouldn\\'t have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn\\'t , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \\nno attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them . \\njust because the protagonist , a \" bad guy , \" is played by mel gibson doesn\\'t mean i will \" root for him , \" and i didn\\'t . \\nquite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) . \\nsince none of the respectable actors in \" payback \" actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out . \\nlucy alexis liu ( of t . v . \\'s \" ally mcbeal \" ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat . \\nmeanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging . \\nunger , who made an impression in 1997\\'s \" the game , \" is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback . \\nfinally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn\\'t appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) . \\nlike most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking . \\nin the course of the 102-minute running time of \" payback , \" porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer . \\nand guess what ? \\nnot only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) , \\neven though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag . \\n \" payback \" is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen . \\nperhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours . \\n',\n"," b'synopsis : wealthy cuban landowner luis ( banderas ) gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride . \\nnot only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia ( jolie ) , she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit . \\nsoon , julia has absconded with both luis\\' fortune and his heart , and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld , luis begins to realise that , for him , there is no turning back . \\nreview : given the absurdism of its would-be plot , it\\'s unlikely that \" original sin \" could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking , regardless of writer , director or stars . \\nthis is , at its heart , b-movie junk : a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions . \\nthat said , \" original sin \" could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it . \\ninstead , cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production , and directs it as such . \\nthe result is a vapid , uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses , as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill . \\nconsider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie : brightly-lit and mostly filmed from above , it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show . \\ncristofer doesn\\'t even manage to capture the allure of cuba ; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy , sensuous island paradise , it appears bland and lifeless . \\nat least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest ; there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script , but aren\\'t being given the chance . \\nthe same cannot be said of jane , whose billy is nebbish and transparent . \\nalso unwise is the jolie framing sequence , which practically gives away the film\\'s denouement . \\n',\n"," b'the general\\'s daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters . \\ndirector simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth . \\nwhat\\'s worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm . \\njohn travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . \\nbrenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth\\'s mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) . \\nsoon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who . \\nebert\\'s law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story . \\nperhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it\\'s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something . \\non a story level , the general\\'s daughter is ineptly constructed . \\nthe film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille\\'s novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and \" shocking \" plot developments . \\nhaving not read the novel , it\\'s difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree . \\nscene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines . \\n ( sunderland actually asks brenner , \" why was she killed ? \" \\nto which i would have answered , \" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . \" ) \\nonly after we\\'ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . \\nnot that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . \\nin one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . \\nshe sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . \\ninstead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner\\'s houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . \\nthis scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it\\'s gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film\\'s complete disregard for the characters and the audience . \\nit was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . \\ni realized that these constructs on screen aren\\'t actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . \\nthis would have been bad enough without the west\\'s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . \\ncompelling films about sexual crimes don\\'t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don\\'t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . \\nthese scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they\\'re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . \\nin addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it\\'s a perversion of everything we know to be pure . \\nthis standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up . \\nas it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . \\nperhaps the only positive elements in the general\\'s daughter are a couple of the performances . \\njames woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . \\ni also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . \\nnonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . \\nthe general\\'s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments . \\n',\n"," b'michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for a stint as a lanky , goofy best friend to jeff

after charles is left unintelligible from a night of heavy drinking at his bachelor party . \\nthe film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery . \\ncritique : this movie did not make me laugh once . \\nperhaps it was because i was tired when i watched it . \\nperhaps . \\nperhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld . \\nperhaps . \\nperhaps it was because the movie just wasn\\'t funny . \\nabsolutely . \\nthe lack of humour wasn\\'t the only issue that i had with this film either . \\nthe movie

hollywood doesn\\'t loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions . \\nthis film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . \\nthey fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges\\' life by shooting an unarmed pow . \\nthat\\'s against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances . \\ncertainly hodges is not complaining . \\nyears pass . \\nhodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer . \\nchilders , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould . \\nbecause of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops . \\nchilders does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command . \\nafter three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd . \\nmore than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down . \\nchilders is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians . \\nhe persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film . \\ndid childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ? \\nor are there simply no rules in war ? \\nthe answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions . \\nthe murder of 83 \" innocent civilians \" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? \\nwhere is the u . n . ? \\nthe film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? \\nthis film ( in a way akin to films such as \" a few good men \" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . \\nthese accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . \\nwhat director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . \\none of the earliest apparent problems with \\'rules of engagement\\' is its lack of credibility . \\nthe entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . \\na lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . \\nthat is precisely why it\\'s not offensive . \\nit is completely unobjective . \\nmany stories are started and never finished . \\nmany questions are asked , but never answered . \\na lot of parallels are referring to nothing . \\nit seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . \\nis it about arab mentality ? \\namerica\\'s foreign policies ? \\namerica\\'s role in the world ? \\ncorruption in the higher circles ? \\nit goes on and on . \\nit consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot . \\nit tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . \\ni think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin\\'s probably most acclaimed film was \" the exorcist \" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film . \\nin this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . \\nthough several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage . \\ni believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . \\nit\\'s obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . \\nthe characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict . \\neven the actors can not save this film from going under . \\nthough both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of . \\nthey have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . \\njackson is gray and jones uninteresting . \\nthe rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . \\nthe time has come for the verdict . \\non the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty . \\non the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty . \\nbut on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it\\'s inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population . \\ni must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys . \\nthis is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . \\nhowever , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . \\nand that it\\'s not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert . \\n',\n"," b'preposterous religious action film ( produced by the trinity broadcasting network ) about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world ( nice of

doomsday prophecies , while casper van dien ( terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a result ) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him . \\nmichael ironside ( great as always , despite the silly film surrounding him ) plays a fallen priest and right hand man to michael york\\'s character . \\nhere\\'s some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside\\'s character . \\nnow despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene , the filmmakers aren\\'t quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil . \\nhow do they fix that ? \\nmake specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes ! \\nthere are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking . . . \\noooooo scary . \\nbut even that wasn\\'t enough for the filmmakers apparently , as they later have to infer that ironside\\'s character is gay ! \\nit comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense . \\nmy main problem with this film is that , despite the silly story ( which could have been pulled off . . . \\nanything can be made believable if executed correctly ) , the events of the film aren\\'t shown with any sense of urgency or importance . \\nfor example , at one point york\\'s character is declared chancellor of the world or something , and we see one brief , cheesy news report about it . \\nthe movie keeps telling us that the apocalypse is coming , but it never seems that way . \\nthere\\'s no \" world reaction \" to anything . \\nthe omega code is available on dvd from goodtimes home video . \\nit contains the film in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and includes the original theatrical trailer , a documentary on the making of the film , production notes , and cast and crew information . \\nthe documentary runs about 25 minutes and is actually surprisingly good ( it looks as though it was made for broadcast on tbn ) , and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone in the cast and crew ( with the exception of michael ironside , unfortunately ) . \\nthe best thing about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed , they do an excellent job of explaining their profession and exactly what it is they do on a movie set . \\nmost documentaries tend to overlook this . \\ndoomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed ( you\\'ll remember his documentary from the 1970\\'s called the late great planet earth , where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist ) . \\nhowever , at the very

commercials , but there isn\\'t . \\ngeorge lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . \\nthis is the first star wars film i\\'ve seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . \\nwhat is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . \\nbasically , the film\\'s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . \\nqui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . \\nwhen their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . \\nqui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . \\nanakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon\\'s ship . \\nhowever , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . \\nmeanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit\\'s end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . \\nthere are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . \\nthis does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . \\nin all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . \\ndespite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . \\nfor starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . \\nwhat a klutz ! \\ngeorge lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . \\nsecondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie\\'s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments . \\nthis is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie\\'s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . \\nthe movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . \\ni can\\'t say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . \\nhowever , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . \\nnatalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . \\nthere is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . \\njake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . \\ndespite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . \\nthe heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn\\'t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . \\nthe film is a treasure to look at . \\nthe visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . \\nnot since 1997\\'s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . \\nthe production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick\\'s 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang\\'s classic silent metropolis . \\nhowever , all the sets are so original . \\nthe original star wars movies can\\'t even match the grandeur of this film\\'s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . \\nthe costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . \\nwhether its queen amadala\\'s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis\\' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . \\nthe costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . \\nas for john williams\\' score , i don\\'t think he\\'s done one as complex or powerful since ? i can\\'t even remember . \\nit is as epic as his schindler\\'s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . \\nit includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . \\nwhat with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . \\nthere is very little to hate in the film : it\\'s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . \\nit is the best \" fun \" film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely . \\n',\n"," b'well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task . \\nhe has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films . \\nin a domain that he owns , it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one . \\neraser , back in 1996 , was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense . \\nbatman and robin , in 1997 , was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting , idiotic action scenes , and painfully flashy costumes . \\nnow in 1999 , \" end of days \" ( not \" the end of days \" ) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold . \\nis this the end of a powerful action star\\'s long-lived career ? \\nwill arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past ( \" terminator \" , \" terminator 2 : judgement day \" , \" predator \" ) ? \\nor an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past ( \" commando \" , \" red sonja \" , \" true lies \" ) ? \\nit doesn\\'t look that way . \\n \" end of days \" begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably , due to the formation of the stars on that night , will be the carrier of satan\\'s baby the hour before new year\\'s of 2000 . \\nfortunately for the movie\\'s sake , the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers , subway trains in dark tunnels , and a myriad of inept nypd officers . \\nit\\'s an action film\\'s dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up . \\nimagine if the girl had lived in anytown , usa , where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office . \\narnold schwarzenegger ( jericho cane ) , in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church , who is trying to hide the girl ( or in some cases trying to kill her ) , and satan ( gabriel byrne ) who is trying to make her pregnant . \\nif the devil is successful , the world will no longer exist as we know it . \\njericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 ) he once had faith but no longer does and 2 ) his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it . \\njericho cane is your cliched , by-the-numbers hero right up to his name . \\narnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can . \\nhe shouts at everyone , from cops to priests , to the devil . \\nin one truly hilarious scene , which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point , jericho screams to the devil ; \" you are a @#$^% ! & \\nchoir boy ! \\nyou are a choir boy ! \" \\nthose two lines marked the high points of this film . \\na movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor . \\n \" end of days \" fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne . \\nbyrne , playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil , seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie . \\nhe wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time . \\nthe annoying thing about his character , however , is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face , yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho . \\ni can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody . \\nthe other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances . \\nkevin pollak , who plays the partner and close friend of jericho , is the supposedly funny character in the film ( every action movie has one ) . \\nthe one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line . \\nrobin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan\\'s baby with extreme annoyance . \\nshe gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film , except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter , or any of the viewers in the audience . \\nin one unnecessary scene , tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off . \\nis this her job in the film ? \\nthe actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible . \\nyou can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does . \\nthis little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie . \\nin a last attempt to make this movie good , special effects are used to try to entertain the audience . \\nbut without a memorable action scene in the whole film , the director has not done his job successfully . \\nthis film would have gotten a c+ if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted \" you are a ! $@^@ * ^ \\nchoir boy ! ! \" \\nfor two hours . \\n',\n"," b'you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they\\'re as real as life . \\ni once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person\\'s brain with microwaves . \\nthen i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections . \\ni even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted . \\nthese people had what are known as \" conspiracy theories \" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public . \\na little imagination goes a long way . \\nin richard donner\\'s conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything . \\nhis latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day\\'s work for him . \\nhe combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions . \\nupstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned . \\nlucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since . \\nwhat she doesn\\'t know is that jerry\\'s interest in her is far more than , well , professional . \\nhe goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment . \\nbut when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry\\'s ideas and his limited-circulation \" conspiracy theory \" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice\\'s help . \\none of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills . \\npart of this is a result of the film\\'s slow pace . \\nit takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement . \\nat over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it\\'s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film . \\ninstead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we\\'re treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite \" black elements \" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill . \\nthey come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time . \\nbig deal , we\\'ve seen it all before . \\nwatching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck . \\nnow , when i say it took forever to set up the \" relationship \" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement . \\noh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring . \\nyou see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory . \\nthe two just don\\'t click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he\\'s been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced . \\nthe script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us . \\ndialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening . \\neven gibson\\'s usual gift for ad lib couldn\\'t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry\\'s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing . \\nunfortunately , much of what\\'s discussed in the film is not inherently important to what\\'s going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it\\'s never followed through . \\nfor example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station . \\nhe even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man\\'s lungs for chlorine . \\nthis is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him . \\nyou know what happens then ? \\nnothing , zip , nada . \\nno follow-up whatsoever , so what\\'s the significance ? \\nokay , here\\'s another one . \\na couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel \" the catcher in the rye \" . \\njerry also has a bunch of copies . \\nwhenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one . \\nleaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we\\'re never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin . \\nnot when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question . \\nthe point becomes totally extraneous . \\noh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ? \\nyeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy . \\nthat\\'s about it . \\nfor all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he\\'s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory . \\nyou can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi . \\nthis guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time . \\nokay , here\\'s my theory . \\nthis really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true ! \\nthe government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over . \\n',\n"," b\"anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . \\nit's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . \\nanna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . \\nwith son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . \\nmongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . \\nanna function is to help provide that link . \\nthe core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . \\nfoster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder . \\nshe is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . \\nit is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career . \\nshe brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster . \\nit's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy . \\nwhen she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . \\nchow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so . \\nthis is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . \\nhe is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . \\nit is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . \\nprecious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . \\nit strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . \\nsome may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . \\nalthough a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . \\nanna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . \\nit shows a seduction of intelligence . \\never mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet . \\n\",\n"," b'about an hour or so into \" the jackal , \" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out \" i hope she gets killed now ! \" \\nat that point it hit me : i didn\\'t care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn\\'t really like . \\nwhen the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he\\'s being played by sidney poitier , you know something\\'s rotten in the state of denmark . \\nevery year , a couple films like this are released . \\nyou know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . \\nthis was the third one of \\'97 , following the very lackluster \" the saint , \" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun \" the peacemaker , \" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . \\n \" the jackal \" tries to mix both elements . \\nand you thought \" the saint \" was bad . \\n \" the jackal \" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i\\'ve yet to see , \" the day of the jackal , \" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . \\nwell , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or \\nis he ? \\nafter being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he\\'ll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion . \\nand like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people . \\nthe agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from \" romeo + juliet \" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of \\'97 ) who\\'s in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever . \\nsoon , he\\'s out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him . \\nthere are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on . \\nthe film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue . \\nsure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register . \\nthe film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one . \\nit doesn\\'t help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances . \\nthe script of \" the jackal \" is a complete mess , mostly because it can\\'t decide what it wants to focus on . \\nis this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ? \\nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who\\'s in everything for the money ? \\nor is it a combination of both ? \\n \" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . \\nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . \\nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . \\nthe supporting characters are worse . \\nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . \\nwhat is poitier doing here ? \\nhe\\'s one of the best living actors ! \\ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? \\ndiane venora\\'s russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . \\nit\\'s not that anyone\\'s bad here ; it\\'s that they have nothing to do . \\nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . \\nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . \\nthere are several times where he\\'s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . \\ntake a scene where he\\'s being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . \\ndoesn\\'t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? \\nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? \\ngeez ! \\nis there anything good here ? \\nwell . . . a \\ncouple things . \\ni did like willis\\'s icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . \\nrichard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . \\nand a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . \\nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they\\'re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is \" the jackal . \" \\ndirector michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior \" rob roy \" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . \\nevery now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( \" clear and present danger , \" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but \" the jackal \" is an example of when they go completely wrong . \\n',\n"," b'john carpenter makes b-movies . \\nalways has ( \" halloween , \" \" escape from new york , \" \" the thing \" ) and , by the looks of it ( \" they live , \" \" escape from l . a . , \" \" vampires \" ) , always will . \\ncarpenter\\'s latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled \" john carpenter\\'s ghosts of mars \" ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else\\'s \" ghosts of mars \" ) . \\nlike all those films prefixed by the very possessive \" john carpenter\\'s , \" \" ghosts of mars \" is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects . \\nin category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic ) . \\ndormant martians ( i . e . , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes . \\nall this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- \" species \" films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train . \\nofficer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james \" desolation \" williams ; what she found was not a pretty picture . \\nin the second category we have ms . henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named \" desolation \" ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming that the story and special effects were going to carry this film and therefore they didn\\'t need to try too hard . \\nin category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird\\'s-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also ) . \\nstate-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however ) doesn\\'t waste any of the film\\'s budget in that department . \\n \" ghosts of mars \" is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry . \\nthe film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly . \\ncarpenter might like to think he\\'s made a western here but it\\'s a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts . \\nit\\'s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken . \\ni never thought i\\'d miss the guy but i do . \\nit\\'s not * all * the same , however . \\ndubbed the \" one-note wonder \" for his minimalist music soundtracks , carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work . \\nfortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue . \\nthe final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless . \\nmars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn \" mission to mars \" and \" red planet \" ( with val kilmer ) . \\n \" ghosts of mars \" sadly adds to those disappointing returns ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them \" american pie 2 \" and \" rush hour 2 \" ) . \\nthe irony is that the mars in carpenter\\'s film feels sadly absent . \\nthere are occasional references to the red planet , of course , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth\\'s closest neighbor . \\ntwo things keep \" john carpenter\\'s ghosts of mars \" from getting a huge slap upside the head . \\n1 . \\nhenstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 2 . the film doesn\\'t pretend to be anything it\\'s not . \\nwhat that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck . \\n',\n"," b\"the word 'rest' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all . \\nwhat does takes place is more based on character development . \\nthe film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people : nick , beth , carol and sid . \\nwhat they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at . \\nnick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield , arizona to butte , montana . \\n ( and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different . . . ) \\ncarol is nick's ex-girlfriend and beth's best friend , sid is a joint-smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in . \\nobviously based on a stage play , the problem with the movie is that there's a lot of things left out . \\nit's not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason why nick was fired from his job isn't mentioned . \\nand why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery , when he hasn't seen them for many years . \\nset in a small ( fictional ? ) \\ntown in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings . \\nthe name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future . \\nparticularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her . \\nnot an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i'll keep an eye on her in the future . \\ninteresting trivia : this was rated r in the us but rated 'barntill ? ten' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it . \\n\",\n"," b'it\\'s terribly unfortunate that \" stir of echoes , \" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996\\'s unsung treasures , \" the trigger effect \" ) , should be released little more than a month after \" the sixth sense , \" which is still going strong at the box office . \\nthese two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , \" stir of echoes \" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while \" the sixth sense \" is closer to a psychological drama . \\nadditionally , while \" the sixth sense \" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , \" stir of echoes \" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist . \\nand where \" the sixth sense \" was disturbing , \" stir of echoes \" is just plain scary . \\ni have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits . \\nadapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , \" stir of echoes \" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath . \\nhe is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there . \\nfinally , he asks , \" does it hurt to be dead ? \" \\napparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike \" the sixth sense , \" this young child isn\\'t the focus of the picture . \\ninstead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist . \\njake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife . \\none night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie\\'s new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him . \\nit unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn\\'t normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months . \\nseeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door . \\nshe didn\\'t expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees . \\n \" stir of echoes \" isn\\'t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family . \\nkevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997\\'s \" dream with the fishes \" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems . \\nafter tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit . \\nbacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet . \\nin a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness . \\nlisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater . \\ntelling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is \" sleep . \" \\nnever before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one . \\ntruthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen . \\nhaving loads of fun with her small role as maggie\\'s sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995\\'s \" to die for , \" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films . \\nfunny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom\\'s visions of the girl , she remarks , \" i wouldn\\'t be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she\\'s dead gives one pause . \" \\nalso of note are jenny morrison ( 1994\\'s \" intersection \" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998\\'s \" whatever , \" as morrison\\'s grieving teenage sister , debbie . \\nif the resolution of \" stir of echoes \" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn\\'t ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty . \\nthe music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters . \\n \" stir of echoes \" isn\\'t as good as \" the sixth sense , \" but why should it need to be ? \\nboth films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and \" stir of echoes \" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film . \\n',\n"," b' \" mandingo \" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , \" a trashy potboiler \" that \" appeals only to the s&m crowd . \" \\nactually , i think \" mandingo \" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . \\nit\\'s too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . \\nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . \\none day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . \\nalthough the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . \\naccording to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . \\nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . \\nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . \\nmeanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . \\nhammond , however , is happier spending nights with his \" bed wench , \" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . \\nit is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . \\nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had \" pleasured \" her before he did . \\nof course , it\\'s fine that he\\'s slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a \" white lady , \" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . \\nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . \\nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . \\nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it\\'s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . \\nhammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . \\nyes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . \\njudging only by the plot , \" mandingo \" is pure sexploitation . \\nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . \\nwhen \" mandingo \" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . \\ndramatically , \" mandingo \" is weak and unfocused , and historically it\\'s mostly confused . \\nif one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . \\nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . \\nthe men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . \\nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but \" mandingo\\'s \" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there\\'s plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . \\nsome tried to write off \" mandingo \" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it\\'s not that easy . \\n \" mandingo \" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as \" the bible \" ( 1966 ) , the remake of \" king kong \" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated \" dune \" ( 1984 ) . \\nthe director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" ( 1954 ) and \" fantastic voyage \" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as \" the narrow margin \" ( 1952 ) . \\nthe script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on \" serpico . \" \\njames mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \\nso why is \" mandingo \" so bad ? \\na number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \\nwexler\\'s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( \" yessuh , massuh \" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( \" fer whut\\'re you gittin\\' outta bed ? \" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( \" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! \" ) . \\nfleischer\\'s direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \\nnevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \\ndespite its exploitative nature , \" mandingo \" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \\nuntil then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \\neven classics such as \" gone with the wind \" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \\n \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn\\'t all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \\nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film\\'s negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \\nwith a little more maturity and different handling , \" mandingo \" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \\nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \\nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler\\'s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \\nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but \" mandingo \" never does it . \\nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \\nthe difference between that film and \" mandingo \" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \\n \" mandingo \" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its \" trashy potboiler \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \\n',\n"," b'isn\\'t it the ultimate sign of a movie\\'s cinematic ineptitude when you can\\'t think of much to say about it other than \" it sucks \" ? \\none of the first official year 2000 releases , supernova is such a movie . \\ni can\\'t seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one , although \" boring , \" \" stupid \" and \" absurd \" doesn\\'t amount to much of a review . \\na shame . \\ni would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate . \\nbut c\\'est la vie . \\nhere goes nothing . \\ni\\'ll keep it short . \\ni suppose the first bad omen for supernova came when director walter hill ( 48 hours ) removed his name from the movie , requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee . \\nthe film\\'s fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press , an event usually signifying a studio\\'s lack of confidence in a particular movie . \\nhill\\'s and mgm\\'s actions were prudent . \\nwhen the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident , a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer , for some reason ( james spader ) is forced to take command . \\nthe ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and , on arrival , picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony . \\none of the crew members ( angela bassett ) knows this passenger , who is played by peter facinelli , and has some bad feelings about it -- and we all know what that means . \\nthis intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown , though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it . \\nanother one of the crew members experiences this first hand ; after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo , he does some impressive handstand pushups . \\nevidently , touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes you younger and stronger . \\nhow ? \\nwhy ? \\nthe movie never bothers to explain . \\nsoon enough though , spader and bassett are running around the ship like mad , being chased by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman facinelli . \\nto be honest , i don\\'t even remember exactly why . \\ni just remember that i didn\\'t care . \\nsupernova\\'s plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas , such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb , but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing . \\nin fact , everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set . \\nwell , the effects are good , though there\\'s hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i\\'m not sure whether that\\'s so remarkable an accomplishment . \\nthe performances are hardly worth talking about . \\ni\\'m not even sure i can call what\\'s here \" performances , \" though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger . \\njames spader is not a bad actor , but he proves to be one of the blandest action stars i\\'ve seen in a while , mostly because he isn\\'t given a character with a personality . \\nthe action scenes are just as bland , since they\\'re pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren\\'t particularly entertaining the first time around . \\nand since the action scenes are everything to this movie , it\\'s pretty much dead in the water . \\nand for the life of me , i can\\'t figure out why it\\'s called supernova . \\n',\n"," b'ingredients : lost parrot trying to get home , friends \\nsynopsis : a russian janitor named misha ( tony shalhoub ) discovers a little old parrot languishing in the basement of a science research facility . \\n \" paulie the talking parrot \" ( the voice of jay mohr ) soon regales misha with his life story . \\nas a young bird paulie is raised by marie ( hallie kate eisenberg ) , a little girl with a speech impediment . \\nby attending marie\\'s speech lessons , paulie learns to act/speak like a regular person . \\nunfortunately , after being unfairly blamed for an accident , paulie is taken to a pawn shop and sold . \\npaulie\\'s biggest wish is to return to marie . \\nmany years later , and after a succession of memorable

he refuses to participate and is imprisoned the basement . \\nwill misha help paulie get back to marie ? \\nopinion : every time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute human personalities , some well-meaning audience members go out next christmas or birthday and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently popular . \\nsoon enough , \" birthday kid \" loses interest and the purchased pup ends up at the local pound , a victim of neglect . \\nmy sister owns a real paulie : it thinks like a parrot , bites like a parrot , and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant . \\nplease think twice before buying one . \\nokay . back to the story . \\nin movies , parrots usually play support characters , but paulie might be the first movie where the ( animatronic ) bird gets main billing . \\npaulie , like those side characters in disney cartoons , is cute and sassy , a strutting , miniature human . \\nactually , paulie is the voice of jay mohr ( he played jennifer aniston\\'s boyfriend on picture perfect ) doing his best buddy hackett impression ( which is interesting , since hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner , and mohr doubles as a customer ) . \\npaulie is for kids . \\nwhile watching paulie you hear little tykes in the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a \" stupid furball . \" \\nsometimes , however , there are statements the kids don\\'t get . \\nfor example , when paulie\\'s elderly owner ivy ( gena rowlands ) dies , paulie explains , \" well , one day , the cat got her . \" \\nand you hear kids exclaim , \" what cat ? ! \" \\nimagine lassie come home , except with a doll-sized human dressed as a bird , and you\\'ll have a good idea of the plot and characterization . \\nbird tries to get home

meeting friends and saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finally makes it back to marie ( trini alvarado ) . \\nthe bottom line ? \\nbreak out the popcorn money , moms and dads . \\npaulie may be the low end version of lassie , bambi , or babe , but he\\'ll do . \\nsometimes the wisecracks go over their heads , but i\\'m sure youngsters can appreciate a story about a little person ( paulie ) trying to get home , meeting friends and experiencing moral lessons on the way . \\nand good luck explaining what it means when paulie says of ivy , \" well , one day , the cat got her . \" \\n',\n"," b'tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse . \\nthe fugitive ? \\nnot quite ? this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had . \\nthere are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ? \\noh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man . \\nboth movies are on video . \\nmake the wise choice and pick the fugitive . \\nthere are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable . \\nwhile serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice . \\nlearning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary . \\nwhen the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she\\'s going back to jail . \\ndirector bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son . \\nevery other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture . \\nin an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something . \\nall that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend \" i miss my son . \" \\nnothing more , nothing less . \\ndr . kimble of the fugitive didn\\'t look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself . \\nlibby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough . \\nashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones . \\nwinning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles . \\npeople still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right . \\nthough i don\\'t think he will win another oscar again . \\nthe ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons . \\neven if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count . \\nburglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby\\'s slipups . \\nthe message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you\\'re innocent of the major crime . \\nhopefully criminals won\\'t use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent . \\nthat would just be plain stupid . \\n',\n"," b'in the wake of the smashing success of \" rumble in the bronx , \" it\\'s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . \\nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . \\nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it\\'s widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . \\navailability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . \\nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . \\nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you\\'re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . \\nto be fair , i must admit that i\\'ve never been very fond of \" period-piece \" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \\nperhaps it\\'s because most of those i\\'ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it\\'s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \\nin fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \\nor , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \\nhaving said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i\\'ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \\nsurprised ? \\nwell , so was i . \\ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \\nwhere he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong\\'s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \\napparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i\\'ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i\\'ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \\none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \\nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you\\'re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren\\'t expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . \\nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china\\'s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \\nhowever , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong\\'s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \\nthe macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \\nin the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \\nin the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \\nafter fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners\\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general\\'s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \\nand so it goes . \\nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \\nlet\\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \\naction . \\nthere\\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \\ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\\'s to be expected . \\nhowever , this isn\\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \\nthe primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \\nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \\nthere\\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \\nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \\nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \\nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \\neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \\namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \\n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \\nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \\ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \\nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \\nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\\'s father\\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \\njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \\nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \\nit\\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \\nthe picture is crisp and clear . \\none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \\n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \\nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \\ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \\nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\\'s to be expected in this type of film . \\nif you like this kind of movie , you\\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \\nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \\n',\n"," b'some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time . \\nplaying god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it\\'s accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one . \\ncongratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing . \\nsome movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed . \\nthen there\\'s playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet . \\nharsh ? maybe . \\njustified ? \\nhell yes ! \\nthis is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes . \\nfor example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away . \\nthis does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : \" oooh , look look ! \\njohn woo ! \\ntwo guns blazing ! \\nslooooow motion ! \" \\nand if that wasn\\'t enough , you can also hear the script grunting under the effort it must take to try and make every single line of dialogue sound like something deep and meaningful like in a tarantino movie . \\npoor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines , you have to admire the effort he puts into it , this guy deserves better . \\nunlike most movies this one does not suffer from \" stupid bad guy \" syndrome , just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes . \\nexample : duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some bandages . \\nnow the bad guy is , like , stoned , man , so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero . \\n ( term used as loosely as possible ) \\nsurvival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds . \\neven when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger . \\nmind you , i\\'ve never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not . \\nsome will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! \\ntwo fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second . \\nsolution ? \\nboom ! \\ni\\'ll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much . \\nanother prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : \\nour boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her . \\nhe knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers . \\nhe still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ? \\nno thanks , i\\'ll just ditch it in the back of my car . \\nand the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! \\nwhile we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ? \\ni\\'ve got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door . \\nask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life . \\nthis is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better . \\nis it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ? \\nfor instance : \\nour heroes hide at duchovny\\'s summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment . \\nok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time . \\nbut see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ? \\nhe chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt . \\noh sure , he\\'ll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling . \\ngoing clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun . \\nfor an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several \" oh come on ! \" \\nmoments . \\n',\n"," b'wyatt earp

meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . \\nhis oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . \\nthe daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . \\nhopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . \\nwhichever one you like , dear , he says . \\nand the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . \\ni liked that scene for two reasons . \\nfirst , the cakes looked really cool . \\nsecond , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . \\nmeet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . \\nit\\'s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it\\'s even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . \\nthe difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . \\ni know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . \\ncase in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . \\nhowever , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . \\n ( it\\'s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) \\nit shouldn\\'t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt . \\nand indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished . \\nwell , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . \\nso , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . \\nanyway , the deceased lawyer\\'s body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role . \\nthe idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world . \\nif this weren\\'t hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who\\'s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn\\'t know how to act in our society . \\nit also doesn\\'t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently . \\nhe claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . \\nhe speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . \\nhe knows everything about some characters , nothing about others . \\nand as played by brad pitt , he\\'s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he\\'s just there . \\nit\\'s as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" \\nit\\'s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . \\ni\\'ve used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt\\'s performance with this year\\'s best angel performance , nicolas cage\\'s in city of angels . \\nwhere pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . \\nwhere cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . \\ncage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani\\'s character is so shallow that she can\\'t see beyond pitt\\'s good looks . \\nthe movie\\'s other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn\\'t save meet joe black . \\nsir anthony hopkins isn\\'t given much better material to work with , unfortunately . \\nhe plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . \\n ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins\\'s character more realistically evil . ) \\nhopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . \\nof course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder . \\nbut i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . \\nhopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . \\nfans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i\\'m sure . \\ni stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i\\'m asking myself why . \\nmovies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i\\'m going to do now . \\ngo spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . \\ndon\\'t go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death . \\n-- curtis edmonds \\n \" no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it . \" \\n-- sideshow bob \\n',\n"," b\"i love this movie , and i've just seen for the umptenth time . \\nunfortunately , it is also completly unknown and very few have seen it . \\nit's my mission in life to spread the word : see this movie ! \\nfred , george , doug and howie are reaching middleage . \\nthree of them have a wife , kids and a house in the suburb with a mortgage to pay . \\nonly fred is still a bachelor . \\ntogether they take the local train every morning to work in town . \\non one of their organized thursday evenings at a bar , fred tells them of his boss and the arrangements he has made to keep a mistress . \\nhe has gotten an apartment in downtown where he can meet her but has told his wife that he needs the apartment to spend the night after staff meetings every thursday night . \\nsince they always split everything four ways , they decide that they should get an apartment with a young woman as well , kathy . \\nhowever , kathy isn't completly honest to them . \\nin fact , she is a sociology student writing a thesis about the sex life of the suburban male . \\nwith these four species she believes that she will make a very good paper . \\nok , have one thing clear though . \\nthe romantic rendezvous' between kathy and each of the men are completly innocent . \\nthe script stays above the waist - or to be precise , above the neck . \\nnoboyd claims that kathy is their mistress , the four guys call her their 'companion' . \\nthe censorship board here in sweden considered it to be suitable only for people above 15 years , but that only shows how long ago 1962 was . \\nsmall children could watch this without being corrupted . \\nkim novak is as lovely as always in this movie , even if she seems to be a bit too old for a student . \\njames garner is the playboy just like in many other movies . \\ni liked howard morris the best as howard the accountant who has to diet to support his wife . \\ntony randall is funny as always . \\n1962 was more than 35 years ago . \\nhow many accountants , copywriters or investment bankers can today afford to live in a house in the suburb with a lot of kids and a wife who does not work ? \\nthis is the white middle class , i can't remember that i saw any blacks on the commuter train they use . \\nthese are the people who can count on their kids to live an even better life than themselves . \\nperhaps this should also be a subject for a thesis in movie sociology ? \\n\",\n"," b'54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \\na greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . \\ni , however , would rather cut to the chase . \\n54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \\nthere is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight . \\nthere is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots . \\nand it\\'s underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they\\'re in this year\\'s boogie nights . \\nthey are so wrong . \\nthe picture has been assembled by mark christopher . \\nbased on this film , i don\\'t know how he got a job in the business . \\n54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s . \\ni don\\'t know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson\\'s brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography . \\nwhat it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes . \\n54 can\\'t even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining . \\nit\\'s remarkably bad timing , i\\'d say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind . \\ni have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance . \\nthat character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves . \\nsteve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself . \\nalas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell\\'s homosexual impulses . \\nit\\'s here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) . \\nshane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life . \\n ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . ) \\nbut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs . \\nwhy his \" friends \" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are \" friends \" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he\\'s been elevated to bartender status ) . \\nthere isn\\'t a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works . \\nmost of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane . \\nthere\\'s a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they\\'re arm-in-arm without a bit of development . \\nthen , they\\'re kissing in a bowling alley ! \\nthis is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn\\'t a long film to begin with ) . \\ncampbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . \\nthis one doesn\\'t . \\nand phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg\\'s star-making role in boogie nights . \\nhe seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone . \\ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me . \\nhe\\'s all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn\\'t help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters . \\nby the end of 54 , shane\\'s most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . \\nthe rest of the performances are wasted . \\nhayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here . \\nmeyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard . \\nonly myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher\\'s wading-pool of a script . \\nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance . \\nin fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . \\ni\\'ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . \\nfrankly , i don\\'t care . \\nit\\'s easy to recreate something technical like this . \\na fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . \\nbesides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . \\naside from myers\\' performance , 54 is a complete failure . \\nit\\'s dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \\nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they\\'re so obvious to me . \\nin any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast . \\nit doesn\\'t even work as mindless entertainment : it\\'s so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it . \\nso , don\\'t forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \\neverything else i said was just padding . \\n',\n"," b'after enduring mariah carey\\'s film debut , glitter , i\\'m reminded of a bit from chris rock\\'s bigger and blacker . \\nin response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , \" you can drive a car with your feet , but that don\\'t mean it should be done . \" \\nto that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don\\'t mean it should be done . \\nsure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles\\' a hard day\\'s night to the spice girls\\' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . \\neverything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . \\nstart off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . \\nthe film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . \\nworse yet , everyone\\'s speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 . \\nmeant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother . \\ninfluential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . \" lucky 7 \" ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star . \\nin predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie\\'s on \" the roller coaster of superstardom . \" \\nin the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom . \\ni won\\'t give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . . \\nyou\\'ll figure it out . \\nthe movie screams to be made with camp , and that could\\'ve been fun . \\nbut the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better . \\nwhat a mistake . \\nthe brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie\\'s first music video -- go over like lead balloons . \\ninstead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah\\'s most dramatic scenes . \\nwhich brings us to the performances , of which there\\'s nothing good that can be said . \\nmariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face . \\nshe actually looks scared during her one love scene . \\nbut you have to wonder if the writing isn\\'t even worse . \\nso much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey\\'s virginal target audience that it\\'s probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb . \\neven the characters couldn\\'t have been written more absurdly . \\nthey\\'re all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , \" billie , i\\'d love to put you in a movie i\\'m making , \" and the big-time record executive who takes billie\\'s demo tape and says , \" oh , i\\'ll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . \" \\neveryone in the film is a device , and it\\'s painful to keep watching just to see another one appear . \\nto say more would be a waste . \\nthere\\'s so much wrong with this film . \\nand , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she\\'s likely to get . \\nbut , then again , i had to suffer through her movie . \\n',\n"," b'if there\\'s one thing i just can\\'t stand , it\\'s a film that oozes with sentimentality . \\nhere\\'s a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . \\nswelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . \\nalas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . \\nwhat reminded me was that i wasn\\'t choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . \\nmy giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word \" cute \" but i\\'ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a \" cute \" film here ) . \\nit takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . \\nmaybe it will work for some people . \\nit didn\\'t work for me . \\nbilly crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . \\nhe\\'s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . \\nthe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . \\nhis name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he\\'d be a great movie star because of his size . \\nsubplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he\\'s never around for them , so they move to chicago . \\nmax is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . \\nsam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . \\nsam is broke . \\nmax is dying . \\npass the kleenex . \\nmy giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . \\nit has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . \\nin one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn\\'t believe that he\\'s actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . \\ncrystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he\\'s countered by a slew of jokes that aren\\'t funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . \\nmuresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can\\'t act very well . \\nquinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . \\nshe was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . \\nhere , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . \\nall of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . \\nas my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . \\nsam\\'s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . \\nlater , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam\\'s reunion with his family . \\nand some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . \\nit\\'s icky . \\nit drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . \\nmy giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . \\nmore importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . \\ninstead , it\\'s a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . \\nand since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . \\n',\n"," b\"mr . bean , a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting . \\nthe first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la , but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride . \\nheck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick . \\neither way look out america bean is coming . \\nwell , what can really be said about this movie , there is very little discernible plot . \\nthat much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy . \\nit achieves that goal rather admirably , but because it is that , the plot is just screaming for help . \\nthe whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed . \\nthe movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went . \\ndon't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece . \\nbut if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie , even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid . \\nthe movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims , or so it seems . \\nnow when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things , first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner . \\nwell , there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure . \\ni have to concede that mr . atkinson's acting in this movie is well done . \\nalthough the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is . \\ni think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue , it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie . \\nnow the rest of the actors in the movie , bad acting and poor casting . \\ni think that the role opposite bean could have been better , just seemed wrong for the movie . \\na different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved . \\none thing that i must say , simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results . \\ntv shows should do just that stay on tv , it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers . \\ni can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively , the best known of those would have to be star trek . \\nbean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved . \\nnow another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly . \\nthe form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people , these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless . \\nbut if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie . \\nbut to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie . \\nthere are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one . \\n\",\n"," b'one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles . \\nhe has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star . \\nafter sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film . \\nunfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for . \\nwe are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do . \\nthen the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is . \\nthe plot of men with guns can be summarized \" in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas . \\ndr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went . \\nand he found out again and again and again . \" \\nof course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell . \\na guerrilla war is always bad for civilians . \\nbut the film talks down to the viewer . \\ndr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country . \\nhe has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios . \\nfuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service . \\nthen he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy . \\nin shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others . \\nthe student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be . \\nfuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general . \\nthe results are little different than one would expect . \\ndr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive . \\neven some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains . \\nbut fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was . \\nsayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians . \\nthe cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences . \\nfederico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos . \\ndamian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter . \\nmandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer . \\n',\n"," b' \" have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming ? \" \\nobviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment , and so to finish us utterly , they have now released \" urban legends : final cut \" . \\nthis is another \" scream \" -like feature , consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time . \\namy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do . \\nbut just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university\\'s film program -- where each year\\'s best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize , a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine ) , whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines . \\nsoon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one . \\nis the culprit the original urban legends murderer , just some random psycho , ! \\na member of the faculty , one of her competitors for the hitchcock , or is there something even more stupid going on ? \\nthis is another one of those tiring , pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary , funny , or interesting . \\nit simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain . \\nthe body counts and screams continue to grow , as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly . \\nin fact watching films like that after having watched \" scary movie \" is impossible keeping a serious face . \\nseveral times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding . \\nand then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing . \\nit\\'s the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century . \\nhow many times must we tolerate the same clich ? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ? \\nit has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them . \\nthey are the most stupid , meaningless , predictable and soulless films in existence . \\nhowever , director john ottman manages to make \" urban legends : final cut \" into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre . \\nwhat was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in \" scream \" , ottman takes seriously . \\nfor that reason alone , it is worth a look , just to realize how bad a movie can be . \\nit\\'s tough to find comparisons for such an achievement , and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect . \\neven movies like \" lost in space \" and \" mission to mars \" seem spectacular in its shadow . \\nwe have not seen such waste of t ! \\nime and resources since \" showgirls \" ( 1995 ) . \\nno matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production , i came up with nothing , except the way the killer was dressed . \\nhere i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu , that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask . \\njennifer morrison ( \" stir of echoes \" ) is all right , and the other actors\\' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script . \\nin fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools . \\nif these graduates will be the directors of the future , then hollywood\\'s golden days are over . \\nrumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment . \\nlet\\'s just hope and pray that it\\'s just an urban legend . \\n',\n"," b'how do films like mouse hunt get into theatres ? \\nisn\\'t there a law or something ? \\nthis diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg\\'s dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst . \\nmouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat-out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison . \\nwriter adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill . \\nthe plot , for what its worth , concerns two brothers ( nathan lane and an appalling lee evens ) who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father . \\ndeciding to check out the long-abandoned house , they soon learn that it\\'s worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder . \\nbut

sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing . \\neddie was cast under the misguided premise that it\\'s easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players . \\nthis finds nba players like greg ostertag , dwayne schintzius , rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper ( though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players ) . \\nperhaps that all didn\\'t matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick . \\nsteve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , \" don\\'t blame me , i just work here . \" \\nperhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn\\'t a movie -- it\\'s a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while . \\namong the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump , new york mayor rudolph giulianni , former new york mayor ed koch , david letterman , letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam , espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert , as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas . \\nand those are the real jokes in eddie . \\nnothing these

decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can\\'t even get the cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right . \\nthe knicks coach who is eddie\\'s antagonist early in the film reappears at the end , but he isn\\'t given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs . \\nneither is frank langella , and none of the athlete-actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of . \\nthat leaves her to do her street-wise miss thang routine , but with no character , no sharp lines and no help . \\neddie isn\\'t just a bad movie with a formulaic premise . \\nit\\'s a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended , because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an

that is how it seems . \\nthis version attempts to recapture the camp of the original . \\nas i've already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy . \\nin the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness . \\nalthough , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon . \\nthe reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud . \\nalthough some of the film's smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows . \\nit also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible . \\nsadly , it doesn't work very well . \\nif you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original . \\n ( although that isn't so hot either . ) \\nthis newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities . \\n\",\n","

constantly picked on in school , and now they cannot hold regular jobs . \\nbut as the trailer goes , \" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at--revenge . \" \\nso he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting-even schemes into a marketable revenge-for-hire business called dirty work inc . \\nthis should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _dirty_work_ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . \\nin fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste of their own medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam\\'s father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $50 , 000 to pay off his bookie . \\nso for all the scheming that goes on , beneath every underhanded plot is--gasp ! --a \\nheart , which undercuts the inherent nastiness of the premise . \\nnot that there isn\\'t a lot of nastiness on display--there is , but of a different sort . \\nthere are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam\\'s impotent father\\'s ongoing lust for them . \\nand for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america\\'s_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far--arguably a bit too much so ( was not one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . \\nbut the issue , of course , is not so much of taste as it is humor--as in , is it funny or not ? \\nthe answer is a resounding no . \\nit\\'s not that macdonald isn\\'t a funny guy . \\nhe was one of the more consistently funny performers on _saturday_night_live_ before his much-talked-about firing , and his dry brand of smartass wit translates well to the big screen ; it also doesn\\'t hurt that he\\'s a natural , likable screen presence . \\nhe is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the oneliners , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gags just don\\'t work ( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings--a real riot ) . \\nstill , macdonald\\'s few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . \\nthe late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance . \\nsaget tries to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent _dirty_work_ from sputtering to the end of its brief 81-minute running time . \\nthe film closes on a sad note of desperation , an indulgent reel of outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement . \\ncome to think of it , i cannot imagine anyone but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of _dirty_work_ . \\n',\n"," b'in

meddling into other countries\\' affairs , under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political , religious or ethnic persecution , the other side is ready to use mantra that says \" look who\\'s talking ! \\nwhat have you done to the indians ? \" \\nhowever , even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes . \\nhollywood is just another example , with its revisionist westerns , made in early 1990s . \\nthose movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus\\' discovery of america . \\none of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers . \\nthe hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi ) , leader of apaches , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century . \\nwhen the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u . s . government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation . \\nhowever , broken promises , injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless . \\nwith not more 30 or so of his followers , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign . \\ngeneral crook ( gene hackman ) , commander of u . s . army forces , respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 , 000 force isn\\'t enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest . \\ninstead , he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt . charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall ) . \\ntogether with young lt . britton davis ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo . \\ngeronimo : an american legend , like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors . \\nso , the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies . \\nalmost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people . \\nalthough such elements of john millius\\' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history , they harm the story of geronimo . \\nto be honest , walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film , but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time . \\ninstead , they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band . \\nto make even worse , hill has some real problems with pacing and style , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers . \\nthe movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo\\'s life before and after his last uprising , in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood . \\nthe difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting . \\nwes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role . \\ncontrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies . \\nwhile this could be expected from someone like jason patric , it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall . \\neven hill\\'s directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and , like in many of his late films , force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s . \\neven his old associate , music composer ry cooder , disappoints , with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic . \\non the other hand , photography by lloyd ahern ii , with the use of red lenses , gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere , ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic . \\nall in all , compared with some of the hollywood\\'s examples of political correctness , this film isn\\'t so bad , but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better . \\n',\n"," b'it seemed like the perfect concept . \\nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \\nit\\'s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \\njim carrey\\'s signed on too ? \\neven better . \\nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \\nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \\nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\\'t funny . \\nit\\'s not for lack of trying . \\nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \\nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \\nsoon enough , charlie\\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \\nthis guy isn\\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \\nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \\nsome have suggested that this isn\\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\\' brand of humor doesn\\'t require plot to work . \\nthey\\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\\' last effort , 1996\\'s \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n ( 1999\\'s \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \\nthe brothers\\' earlier film wasn\\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \\nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \\n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \\nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \\nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \\nbut they haven\\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \\nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \\n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \\nyeah , me too . ) \\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\nthis doesn\\'t really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\n',\n"," b\"edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back , and like his previous two , it is a working-class

are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine . \\nrequiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) . \\nbut a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they\\'re dealing with , as she memorably puts it , \" aren\\'t speaking russian \" . \\nmeanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s . navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions . \\nthis crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them . \\nthe human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron\\'s aliens . \\nthe stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding . \\nand so they should be : cameron\\'s technical credentials are well established . \\nbut what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis\\' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss . \\nthe abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects . \\none is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile . \\nthe second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film\\'s end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war . \\nwith the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story\\'s climax is now given real weight . \\nwhy on earth were they left out of the original ? \\nthis reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible . \\nso then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that\\'s turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent . \\ni say \" quite \" because some flaws do remain . \\nthe most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag . \\nnonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron\\'s greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound . \\n',\n"," b\"this is the worst

\\ni feel the production got a little too smug , the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie . \\nmy greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed ( thurman and fiennes ) ? something that was a vital element of the 60's tv serial of the same name . \\nthe dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks , but does not allow much room for character development and interaction , except to perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves . \\none

physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch . \\noverwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past . \\nthe actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there\\'s room to breathe in a role that\\'s made up of shades of gray like \" onegin \" . \\npetula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in \" parking lot \" : \" you don\\'t know what you\\'ve got ? til it\\'s gone . \" \\nonegin\\'s about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read :

a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties . \\ntyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares . \\nthey both have faces , mr . fiennes and ms . tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery . \\n_onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of \" masterpiece theater \" , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm . \\nan mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair . \\nthe film has an atypical period look , as well . \\nabsent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions . \\nthe sets are almost expressionistically bare , echoing the loneliness of the protagonists . \\n ( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them ; i\\'m reminded the climax , which unfolds in a sea of white . ) \\nmartha fiennes has a clear command of cinema , and her spare , often painfully human visual presentation of \" yevgeny onegin \" is

in the same body . \\njungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it\\'s difficult to integrate both . \\noften we\\'ll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung\\'s magician , sit around imagining grand schemes . \\nwithout the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams . \\nwarriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy . \\nthey don\\'t care enough about anything to know what\\'s worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle . \\nthis dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies . \\namerica during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers . \\ntodd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype . \\nchosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine . \\nhis childhood is cruelty and competition . \\nhe is indoctrinated with the big rules . \\nnever question authority . \\nwinning is everything . \\nstrength beats knowledge . \\na veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he\\'s obsolete . \\na new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger . \\nleft

alive . \\nhe finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health . \\nwhen the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world . \\nthey are the other good guys . \\nthese lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons . \\ntodd finds himself in the role of protector . \\nwhat could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon . \\nthe effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion . \\nthe plot is old hat .

this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines . \\nsomething like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun . \\nwith the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror . \\njudging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move . \\nthe movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably . \\ndone right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema . \\nunfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong . \\nthe only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be . \\ni will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward . \\nthose guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats . \\nthese bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people . \\nboy , are these bats ugly . \\nthey are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart . \\nthey've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all . \\na whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats . \\nthey have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do . \\nthe bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good . \\nbut no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers . \\nthe film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores . \\non the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations . \\nbut sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude . \\neven the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed . \\nthe sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) . \\nthe scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field' . \\nmeyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition . \\nher memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws' . \\neverything revolving around `bats' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up . \\nthe supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later . \\nin fact , that may have worked out better in the end . \\ntake one glance at casper's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief . \\nunfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny . \\nin the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch . \\nmccabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats . \\nthe entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else . \\nsomething like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ? \\ni just want my money . ' \\nthe bats are ugly , i must say . \\nthere's the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing , but mainly , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery . \\nonly bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been , but by the absurdly stupid climax , it's way too late in the game for a decent recovery . \\ncharacters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire . \\nlet's explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ? \\nyou could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one , and after that there are only 18 , 000 more of them . \\nthis kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats' . \\n\",\n"," b'first impressions :

thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas . \\nhowever , i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas , but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have embraced ) that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie . \\ntommy lee jones and will smith play two \" government \"

something to this film that ruined its plot : he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films . \\nwhenever i saw d\\'onofrio\\'s bug stomp and eat people in the film , it got terribly boring after a while . \\nwhile smith\\'s wise-cracks did fill in the gaps , it wasn\\'t enough . \\nand also , i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub-plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent , they can\\'t have contact with any humans really . \\nand here i see jones , at a satellite computer , watching his lover plant the garden ? \\na sentimental moment in an alien movie ? \\nnice try , but i don\\'t think so . \\nit doesn\\'t work here . \\nit just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring : we don\\'t only have aliens to worry about , but now we have jones\\'s conscience . \\ni came into the movie not wanting to see jones\\'s conscience , but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it . \\nmaybe it\\'s unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were . \\nnevertheless , even though some parts are indeed funny , the plot in this movie

bacon\\'s character opts to commit sex crimes . \\ner , it\\'s kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio-molecular research scientist ? \\nsomething sounds horribly wrong already . \\nbut this is a paul verhoeven film , and the sleazepin director of such open-crotch classics as \" basic instinct \" and the infamous \" showgirls \" never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which , when you come right down to it , is all this film is about . \\n \" hollow man \" features a string of hapless , c-list actors ( among them bacon , elisabeth shue , josh brolin , and kim dickens ) in a grade-z plot with a lot of special effects that , frankly , don\\'t look much better than those used in the 1933 version of \" the invisible man . \" \\noh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he\\'s attempting reentry but otherwise it\\'s lots of \" thermal \" shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support . \\nsince invisibility , once achieved , isn\\'t much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ) , the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon\\'s character gets invisible he can head straight for them . \\nit\\'s as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is \\nsimply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin . \\nas a horror film , \" hollow man \" is unsophisticated and disturbing ( in its intent , not its achievements ) and not worth your time or your hard-earned dollars . \\nit\\'s minor verhoeven--and even that\\'s not saying much--and boy is it hollow . \\n',\n"," b'contact is a film that tries to do several different things . \\nit is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . \\nthe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . \\nthe portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv\\'s the x-files . \\nthe aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . \\nthey know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . \\nthe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters\\' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick\\'s 2001 : a space odyssey . \\nmost of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . \\nscientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . \\nthe debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway\\'s atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind\\'s representative to another species . \\nthe film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . \\nstill , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . \\nthe two \" sides \" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . \\npalmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . \\nthen again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . \\ncontact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . \\nthe film\\'s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . \\nfor one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . \\nthe romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss\\'s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( \" i guess you could say i\\'m a man of the cloth , but without the cloth \" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . \\ninstead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . \\ngranted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers\\' part more than anything else . \\nthe successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . \\neven if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn\\'t ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . \\ncontact doesn\\'t quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . \\nand i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . \\n',\n"," b'battlefield long , boring and just plain stupid \\nbattlefield earth \\na film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman \\nin my mid-teen years , i had

while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says . \\nnaturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government . \\nlt . col . nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest \" unbreakable \" code , mercury . \\nhowever , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code . \\nnaturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l . l . \\nginter ) to eliminate the security hazard . \\nand that\\'s where art jeffries comes in . \\nfor some reason that\\'s never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy . \\nin a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall . \\nthe central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous . \\nwhy bother trying to kill the kid . . . i \\nmean , who would know ? \\nit\\'s not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher . \\nand even if he is eliminated , what does that help ? \\nhe\\'s already proven that mercury can be broken . \\nthere\\'s always the chance that someone else would crack it . . . but \\ni guess without a kid in jeopardy , there\\'s not much of a movie here . \\nfor all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser ) . \\nthe film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot . . . then \\nmr . terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill . . . quickly . \\nmiko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance . \\nhowever , don\\'t go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will ) . \\ninstead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half . . . with a twist ! ) \\nwillis and baldwin are just overplaying to type . \\nrather than creating a nuanced character , baldwin simply oozes sliminess . \\nand for willis\\' part , he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop/fbi agent ( which he has honed in the die hard series ) . \\nas almost an afterthought , about halfway through , the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene . \\nbut the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay . \\nthis film wasn\\'t well thought out at all . \\nthe film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible . \\nthe carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member . \\nat first the bad scenes just trickle in , but by the gruesomely bad finale they\\'re a veritable flood . \\nthe film\\'s few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes ( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode ) . \\nbut they\\'re not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile . \\nmercury rising is a thriller that you\\'re more likely to groan at than cheer . \\n',\n"," b'drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside - the one who\\'s the awkward klutz or the spunky do-it-yourselfer ; the one who just doesn\\'t fit in with the others . \\nshe has perfected these characters in movies such as \" the wedding singer \" and , most notably , \" ever after . \" \\nnow she\\'s back , starring in what could be called a modern-day cinderella fable - \" never been kissed . \" \\nyou know it\\'s a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary . \\ntrust me on this one , no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg ( and i don\\'t mean steve ) invented the printing press . \\nthe premise is simple . \\nbarrymore\\'s josie geller , at 25 the youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun-times , is assigned to go undercover and return to high school to do an expose on what today\\'s teens are feeling and doing . \\njosie ( she says she was named after the \\'70s cartoon character ) was a geek in high school , so she jumps at the opportunity for a second chance . \\nthis time , she thinks , she will get it right and be accepted by the in-crowd . \\nnow , what kind of adult - with a good job and a successful career - would actually look forward to reliving the hell that was - and is - high school and adolescence . \\nthese are among the many problems that plague \" never been kissed . \" \\nscreenwriters abby kohn and marc silverstein cannot get a handle of josie . \\ntheir script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy , blubbering woman-child at the least provocation . \\nand the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are supposedly south glen high school\\'s most popular girls leads you to question her maturity and mental stability . \\nok , so \" never been kissed \" is not a sociological expose of today\\'s high school scene . \\nhowever , certain rules should apply to film , and one of those is consistency of character . \\namong the movie\\'s problems is the ill-conceived conceit that josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain and , in the process , lose focus on her assignment . \\nany competent editor would have tossed her ass out the door quicker than you could say \" get me rewrite . \" \\nto be fair , barrymore is very appealing , but she is given very little to work with . \\nshe tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character , but the script continually undermines her . \\nbarrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of the script in which she tries to walk , talk and act like a cool , hip high schooler . \\notherwise , she is left foundering on a cliched sea of teen-age stereotypes and situations . \\n \" never been kissed \" is entertaining and funny in fits and starts . \\nit lacks consistency and a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish . \\nthe movie\\'s main bright spot is provided by leelee sobieski as aldys , the outsider who befriends new student josie . \\njosie sees a lot of her former self in aldys , yet still abandons her to hang out with the popular girls . \\nreal mature . \\nand that is the main deficiency with \" never been kissed . \" \\nit\\'s illogical , unrealistic , uneven and undemanding . \\nit has some warm and humorous spots , but not enough to overcome its many obstacles . \\n',\n"," b'at one point in this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong . \\nbut one member of the crowd stands up and cheers , thinking the performance was planned , and applauding it for their efforts . \\nthat\\'s \" dirty work \" in a nutshell . \\na very different kind of movie . \\nthis is not a movie that i can easily review . \\nthe critic in me analyzes the structure , plot , acting , characters . \\n . \\n . and \\ntells me this movie is terrible . \\nbut the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing . \\nthis movie plays more like

\\nrealizing they are very good at revenge plots , they open a revenge for hire business , eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald ( who after roles in \" happy gilmore \" and \" veronica\\'s closet \" seems typcast in this role ) , who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriend\\'s grandmother , thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night of the grand opening of a new opera house . \\nfirst the critic in me . \\nthe plot is the standard poor guy vs evil rich guy device , where the main character meets the girl of his dreams along the way . \\nhere\\'s the catch . \\nnone of the characters are sympathetic . \\nthey\\'re all selfish jerks who don\\'t care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want . \\nthe jokes are juvenile , crude , appealing to the worst elements in people . \\nthere\\'s jokes about prostitutes , the homeless , beastiality , anal sex . \\nthere\\'s even a subplot that\\'s developed , it seems , only to make jokes about infidelity and incest . \\nand i loved watching it . \\ni was a huge fan of norm macdonald\\'s sarcastic , to-the-point comedy on saturday night live , and this movie is an hour and a half of it . \\nnorm macdonald takes a joke , strips it to the core , and tells it like it is with a dry wit . \\nlike the scene were he and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job . \\nthe foreman goes over the basics , which mitch and sam don\\'t understand . \\nhow do they get out of it ? \\nby admiting they lied on their resumes , and don\\'t know a thing about construction ! \\nand surprise , they get fired . \\nthe characters are incredibly mean-spirited . \\nthere\\'s a father who\\'s loud and obnoxious , a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father\\'s condition by saying \" if i were a gambling man i\\'d put a lot of money on death . \" \\nthe businessman cole who always has his dog spunky , and does who knows what with it . \\nand then there\\'s mitch and sam , who , thinking they can get $50000 by destroying a building , ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents . \\n \" too bad we have to do it , \" mitch says . \\nhere\\'s a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up , where you see every punchline coming , where every spot profanity could be used and then is used . \\nat least the film is honest , and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic . \\nbut at least it isn\\'t dull , and it isn\\'t predictable . \\nand that\\'s the way it should be . \\nit\\'s sketch comedy , and if you\\'re a fan of norm macdonald , you\\'ll love it . \\nthe jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn\\'t care . \\nif you don\\'t like norm macdonald , or stupid movies , then you probably won\\'t like this one . \\nthe jokes are crude , the characters are mean to the core , the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn\\'t care . \\nso before seeing this one , tune your mindset , and prepare for a slew of norm macdonald humor , gay animal sex , prison rape jokes , uncaring characters , and one last performance from chris farley . \\nthe critic in me says ( * ) but i give it an 8 ( * * * ) . \\ni just couldn\\'t stop laughing . \\n',\n"," b'set in harlem during the great depression , rival gangster \" families \" go to war over control of \" the numbers \" , an illegal gambling lottery . \\n \" runners \" take bets from potential lottery winners and deliver them to private locations for drawings . \\nthe undisputed leader of the harlem numbers is the madame queen ( cicely tyson ) who is challenged by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum . \\nby turning against the queen , dutch defies his partner , the infamous lucky luciano ( andy garcia ) , who wishes to respect the queen and keep the peace . \\nthe queens\\' army strengthens when an acquaintance , ellsworth \" bumpy \" johnson ( lawrence fishburne ) is released from prison and becomes a bodyguard for her . \\nhe proves himself worthy in short time as he thwarts an assassination attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later takes control of the queens army when she is jailed for tax evasion . \\nbumpy\\'s reign is not as restrained and subdued as the queen and he declares all out war on dutch . \\nbloody gang warfare ensues . \\nbumpy faces many obstacles during his reign . \\nhis new army questions his methods . \\nhis girlfriend ( vanessa l . williams ) and the queen disagree with his violent solutions . \\nmost importantly ( in his eyes ) , dutch has become a more formidable foe than he imagined , and seeks help from lucky luciano to assassinate him . \\nthere have been so many movies dealing with organized crime that it must be hard to write an original story dealing with it . \\nthis movie is not original at all . \\nin fact , i was angered by how many similarities there was between this film and , arguably , the best gangster movie of all time , the godfather . \\nif you are going to borrow ideas from another movie and not give credit , why not borrow from a lesser known movie ( say , millers crossing ? ) . \\nhow could the credited screenwriter chris brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? \\nhere are just some of the major similarities ( i stopped counting at 10 ) . \\ncrooked cop assaults blood relative of the leader . \\ngang extracts revenge on crooked cop . \\nwife ( or girlfriend ) questions her partners\\' murderous activities and leaves him . \\nhigh ranking \" officer \" betrays the leader . \\nblood relative of the leader murdered . \\nwar erupting between the \" families \" . \\nhigh-ranking officer disapproves of the leader in front of other family members . \\nnew leader runs family differently from previous leader . \\nlarge meeting with all families involved . \\nthe setup in this movie is done rather well . \\ni enjoyed the portrayal of the network of \" runners \" sprinting through the streets collecting bets for the queens lottery . \\nthis was the way of life in harlem , and most people involved with the queen did so because it was the only way to support their families and put food on the table . \\nnumber running was the only way for the harlem population to find work . \\ni also enjoyed the interaction between the angry , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucky . \\nafter about the 30-40 minute mark all of the similarities with the godfather start appearing , one after the other ( and in short order ) . \\nit was a huge distraction , and an insult to my intelligence . \\nwho was the screenwriter kidding here ? \\nsome of the individual performances were well done . \\nandy garcia was very convincing as lucky , unfortunately his screen time is reduced to a supporting role . \\ntim roth effectively plays the cocky villain , much like his roles in \" the cook , the thief , his wife and her lover \" and \" rob roy \" . \\nthe good performances and convincing setup during the first third of the movie do not make up for the

years , he\\'s unwilling to marry her . \\nhis reasons ? \\nwell he\\'s a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don\\'t like to be roped or something ( hey , that\\'s the movie\\'s explanation . . . \\ni\\'d marry renee zellweger in a second ) . \\neventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it\\'s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . \\nhe essentially says to her , \" you win \" and hands her a ring . \\nthe audience should now hate this character . \\ni did . \\nthen the meat of the plot presents itself . \\njimmie\\'s grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business . \\nhowever , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) . \\nhaving blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a \" business proposition \" . \\nthe movie wasn\\'t half bad by this time , surprisingly . \\nit wasn\\'t boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point . \\nustinov\\'s character left a video will , and while he\\'s reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself \" what is this , brewster\\'s millions ? \" . \\nas soon as i thought it , hal holbrook\\'s character actually says \" what is this , brewster\\'s millions ? \" \\nit was quite surreal . \\nsomething happens though during the film\\'s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive . \\nup to that point , all of jimmie\\'s prior girlfriends had turned down his \" business proposition \" which i felt was good . \\nat least the film wasn\\'t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers . \\nwhen jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story . \\nat this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride . \\nthese women arrive at jimmie\\'s location and immediately start bullying him about what he\\'s looking for in a woman . \\nwhen he\\'s had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there\\'s been a mistake and he won\\'t be marrying any of them . \\nas a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off . \\nthis goes on for the rest of the film . \\nit\\'s just chris o\\'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women . \\nmy groans of disgust could be heard for miles . \\nthe film finally ended (

and you\\'ve got a doozy of a movie that , while not as bad as it could have been , isn\\'t a very good film . \\nhowie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground ) . \\nin the slightly contrived opening scenes , we witness his heroism in action , as he , and his mentor ( played by scott glenn ) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire . \\nwilliam forsythe plays the bad guy , a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak . \\nhe ( and five convict cohorts ) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby . \\nhis escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards , but ( since there must be a movie ) luck

discovers their true identity , he is the only thing standing between them and escape , and the only hope of help for the hostage . \\nlong\\'s acting talents are above those of , say , steven seagal , but not by much . \\nalthough his delivery is mostly flat and wooden , he\\'s a likeable hero , and there are some hints here and there that he may get better . \\nthe script doesn\\'t help him out any , however . \\nall too often , it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny . \\nthe dialogue is strictly b-movie material , and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable . \\nlong\\'s co-stars are a mixed bag . \\nat least they\\'re all comfortable in their respective roles . \\nforsythe has the scenery-chewing villain down cold , down cold , and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch , even when he doesn\\'t seem to be stretching his talents ( as is definitely the case here ) . \\nsuzy amis plays peril pretty well , but isn\\'t given much more to do . \\nsome of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting , but many are rather bland . \\nyou\\'d think that the director , dean semler , a former cinematographer , would at least produce a film with interesting visuals . \\nthat\\'s not the case . \\nthere\\'s a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences . . . we\\'ve \\nseen this stuff before . \\nit\\'s not the most auspicious start to 1998 , but it could have been worse ( just think back to 1996\\'s debut , bio-dome ) . \\nhowever , after a month of oscar-caliber pictures , a movie like firestorm at least gives you some

wisecracking neighbor upstairs . \\nin the meantime , someone sends sarah rotting flowers , puts her name in the newspaper\\'s obituary column , and kills her cat . \\ncomments : never talk to strangers , a colossal waste of time , moves slower than molasses in winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film . \\none wouldn\\'t think that two genuine movie stars , antonio banderas ( evita ) and rebecca de mornay ( hand that rocks the cradle ) , and the acerbic comic genius dennis miller ( \" saturday night live \" ) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey . \\nnot only are they in it , however , but de mornay executive produced it . \\nwhat was she thinking ? \\nnever talk to strangers centers upon sarah , a psychologist examining the ill-tempered max , a murderer soon to stand trial . \\nshe receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tragedy in her early childhood . \\ntwo men woo her ; tony the \" security consultant \" wins her over ( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music ) . \\na lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder , but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd and sarah , and instead offers several male characters as red herrings . \\n86 minutes , the running time of this cinematic mess , thus , seem like 86 hours . \\na good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah and tony . \\nwhy would the career-minded , professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony ? \\nthat\\'s one of the film\\'s mysteries which are never answered . \\nregardless of motive , de mornay and banderas strip down and have sex several times in what passes for eroticism . \\nthey also manage to go out before copulating occasionally -- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film , tony takes sarah to a carnival that\\'s * right outside * his dingy apartment ( that way , they can hurry back and have sex quickly ) . \\nalso , apparently , the weather changes quickly in their locale : they\\'re at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex ; the next day , they\\'re out playing in the snow before having sex . \\nthe filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony and sarah\\'s \" character development . \" \\nsomeone is out to get poor sarah ( though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts ) . \\nrotting flowers , a writeup in the obituary , and a beaten neighbor are just a few of the bad things which happen to her . \\nsuspense cliche number one also occurs : whenever someone is stalked in thrillers , by any means , if the stalked has a pet , that pet will die . \\noftentimes , to even further the cliche , the murdered pet is a cat ( suspense filmmakers , for some reason , just don\\'t like cats ) . \\nsarah , in never talk to strangers , receives a package and , lo and behold , discovers her mutilated cat within . \\nsuspense at its very derivative ! \\nas stated before , never talk to strangers is a poor excuse for a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting banderas and de mornay\\'s bodies as often as possible . \\ncomedian dennis miller is completely wasted here ( he\\'s not given lines that are suitable for his persona ) and doesn\\'t even appear all that much . \\nmaybe , in a way , he\\'s lucky for that . \\nearly on in the movie , sarah tells tony , after meeting him in a supermarket , that she had been advised to never talk to strangers . \\nallow me to advise that you never watch this stinker . \\n',\n"," b'wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you\\'re the victim of a frontal lobotomy . \\nthere is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group . \\nthis is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core . \\nwild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . \\ni\\'ve seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch . \\nwild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it\\'s a thriller with a real story . \\nwhat it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . \\neverything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . \\nthe film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it . \\nusing this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once . \\nthat\\'s not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what\\'s around the next corner . \\nthe ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex . \\nboth have an abundance of screen time , although i\\'ll admit that the film\\'s erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected . \\nnothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ? . \\nthe soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don\\'t generate much heat . \\nthe lesbian kisses can\\'t hold a candle to those in bound . \\ntheresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad \" no nudity \" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) . \\nthe film\\'s greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . \\nmaybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . \\nkevin bacon ) is familiar with . \\nthe director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life . \\nthat movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script . \\nit\\'s difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . \\nbut i suppose we all need to put food on the table . \\nmcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment ) . \\nquick cuts and pretty sunrises can\\'t even begin to cover up this movie\\'s flaws . \\nthe main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida\\'s blue bay high school . \\na student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him . \\none afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn . \\nafter confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) . \\nthey are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale . \\nmeanwhile , sam , convinced that he\\'s being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help . \\nthe acting in wild things isn\\'t very good , but none of the principals have much to work with . \\nthis is definitely not a character- based motion picture . \\nnot only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q . , but it doesn\\'t bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth . \\nthe men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more . \\nmatt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps . \\nneve campbell gets to model the slutty look . \\ndenise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through , one-piece bathing suit . \\nand nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon . \\nthe only one who\\'s even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he\\'s in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he\\'s got the right idea ) . \\ncolumbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film\\'s ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ? \\nwild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by . \\nthanks to jeffrey kimball\\'s polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton\\'s score keeps it pulsing and throbbing . \\nbut , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks . \\n',\n"," b'it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon , when the only good things on tv are the second-rate movies they show ( some are good : they showed \" total recall \" before this one ) . \\nif you know me , i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live . \\nand this includes keanu reeves . \\nwhat do i hate about seagal ? \\ni hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening and non-threatening situation ( the squint ) . \\ni hate those scenes in every movie where he goes around , bullying people up , saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold\\'s hairpiece in \" boogie nights . \" \\ni despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights . \\ni hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain . \\ni hate his non-satirical messages ( in the beginning of this one , he slaps on a quote from arthur miller , which has nothing to do with the film , except it\\'s about brooklyn where this film takes place ) . \\nand i hate how he\\'s so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing ( during the end credits , he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him ) . \\nsure , the guy\\'s probably a nice guy in person ( i actually found him very non-threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago ) . \\nbut the guy makes worse films than reagan did . \\nso what\\'s the plot of this shit-terpiece ? \\nwell . . . something \\nabout him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsythe ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight . \\ni couldn\\'t believe how bad this scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ( ahem ! ) . \\nand forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off . \\ni\\'m sorry , did anyone ever hear of concealing one\\'s self ? \\nso in comes ex-brooklynite seagal , who dedicates his life to catching this guy . \\nand i just wished he had caught him in the beginning , then ended the film . \\nbut noooo , this drags on , as he bullies forsythe\\'s family members ( including a stupid bar-owner , and none other than gina gershon as his other bar-owner sister ) . \\nand forsythe more than once threatens his family . \\nat one point , he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a non-threatening nicholson in \" the shining \" ( complete with them all hiding in the bathroom , but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away ) . \\nseagal paints himself as a lovable person , with a son , and a fiancee . \\nhe even shows him hanging with his son , checking up on his homework , and then about to take him out for a bit of \" catch , \" when he\\'s conveniently called away on assignment . \\ni dunno about you , but playing \" catch \" with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares . \\nhe also shows him as that bad-ass he wants to be , with scenes of him bullying crooks around , and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he\\'s unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue . \\nserves them right . \\nthis film , as some of his do , has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented , but don\\'t appear to be in this film . \\ni already mentioned gina gershon ( who\\'s pretty horrible in this one ) , as well as william forsythe , who over-acts terribly . \\ni know this guy can act : he was awesome in \" raising arizona \" as goodman\\'s partner in crime . \\nbut he\\'s just awful here . \\njerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down . \\nwhy is he the only one who gives a good performance ? \\nwell , because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility . \\nhe seems to be in here just to give it a cool \" law and order \" feeling ( even if it\\'s not a \" cool \" feeling ) . \\nand in cameos are b-rated erotic-thriller-cinemax-style stars , shannon whirry ( as \" terry malloy , \" which is more of a bad joke than a clever one ) and athena massey . \\noh ! \\nand \" er \" \\'s julliana margiulles has two scenes . \\n \" out for justice \" just proves once again that american action films just suck . \\ni know that there\\'s such a good thing as good action - he\\'s called john woo . \\nbut if you\\'re in the mood for some good old no-brainer , fun-yet-dumb action , don\\'t bother watching this . \\nit\\'s so stupid that it\\'s boring . \\n',\n"," b\"i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release . \\nmichael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof . \\nthe movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) . \\ngreeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes . \\nthese are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences . \\nit appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line . \\nif at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words . \\nbut , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest . \\nit's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor . \\nfor the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk . \\nwish me luck . \\nfirst and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport . \\nwhile i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke . \\nhe constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions . \\nanother plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character . \\nthey meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there . \\nit's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis . \\nbut now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ? \\nenough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience . \\nit's stupid , pointless and repetitive . \\ni can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone . \\naction fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited . \\nand those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks . \\ndon't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs . \\nit's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced . \\nthe impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed . \\nit's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure . \\ncoburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie . \\nespecially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film . \\nthings get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat . \\nif that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover . \\ntheir crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here . \\nwait , maybe the only big laughs . . . \\ni'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk . \\ni can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that . \\ni suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate . \\nbut hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck . \\n\",\n"," b\"keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival . \\non the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . \\nthey need not have wasted their time . \\nthe movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . \\nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . \\ni wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either . \\nkeep cool just isn't very funny . \\nthe prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . \\nalthough the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost . \\ntoo bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh . \\nqu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . \\nhowever , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade . \\nit was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . \\nyou see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . \\nat least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . \\ncinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . \\nalthough some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . \\nheadache , as i said . \\nthe film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . \\nthey used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . \\nthe first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back . \\nof course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . \\nin the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . \\nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . \\nthere is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . \\nthere is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . \\nthe bookseller would be better off without her . \\nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . \\nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . \\nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . \\na friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . \\nalthough only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . \\nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on . \\na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half . \\nbut of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . \\nthere are a few things that keep cool does right . \\nas mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . \\nalthough it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . \\nin one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . \\nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . \\nthe nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . \\nwith every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . \\nunfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . \\n\",\n"," b'like a good action film should , \" metro \" has action that keeps you involved . \\nsome action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts . \\n \" the ghost in the darkness , \" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep . \\nbut \" metro \" is one of the best action films in a while . \\nit is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy . \\neddie murphy was in bad shape for a while . \\nand this invites me to mention last year s \" the nutty professor , \" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be . \\n \" metro \" happens to be a lot better than any film in the \" beverly hills cop \" series . \\nthat is because \" metro \" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun . \\neddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people . \\nthe \" beverly hills cop \" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch . \\nin \" metro \" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble . \\nhis character in \" metro \" takes himself seriously . \\neddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in \" metro , \" and perhaps it is quite better off that way . \\nmurphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator . \\nin the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up . \\nmurphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor . \\nthe film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim . \\n \" metro \" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car . \\ncars flip . \\ncars crash . \\ncars turn over . \\nand it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of \" speed , \" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons . \\nthere are also some other good scenes in \" metro \" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have . \\nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . \\nof course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . \\nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . \\nthose are the scenes that make up \" metro , \" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . \\nthe actor that i most enjoyed seeing in \" metro \" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . \\nit was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . \\nrapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . \\ni hardly recognized him in \" metro , \" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . \\nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . \\nthe villain in \" metro \" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . \\nhe is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . \\nwincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in \" kiss of death . \" \\nand , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . \\ni liked \" metro , \" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . \\nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . \\n \" metro \" is a no-nonsense movie . \\nit works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . \\nand it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . \\nbut who cares ? \\nit still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . \\noh , and there were plenty of explosions in \" metro , \" as well . \\nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . \\nif there is one major objection i had to \" metro \" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . \\n \" metro \" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end . \\npaul haynes \" > \\n',\n"," b' \" six days , seven nights \" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare . \\nhere\\'s a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it\\'s fluff , recognizes it\\'s fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff . \\nof course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie\\'s success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it\\'s easy to forget what a funny guy he can be . \\nas his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance . \\nthe age difference ( ford\\'s 56 , heche\\'s 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that\\'s hard to come by . \\nthe story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe . \\nrobin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there . \\nthe plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization . \\na series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other . \\nmeanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn\\'s shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) . \\nthat subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin . \\nand since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience . \\ndirector ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk . \\nat a slim 101 minutes , \" six days , seven nights \" never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title . \\nmichael browning\\'s clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is \" you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? \" ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they\\'re all quite engaging . \\neven the movie\\'s more \" serious \" moments are played with a wink . \\nheche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the \" believability \" of \" six days , seven nights \" \\' heterosexual pairing . \\n ( so she\\'s a lesbian . \\nso what . \\ndeal with it . ) \\nof course it doesn\\'t , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way . \\nin fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity . \\nat one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is . \\nafter several wrong guesses ( \" forty-five ? \\n_fifty_ ? \" ) , he whispers his age to her . \\n \" you still look good , \" heche stammers . \\n \" i still _am_ good , \" ford replies . \\nshe\\'s good too , and together , they make \" six days , seven nights \" one memorable ride . \\n',\n"," b\"starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role . \\nnot that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . \\nand in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence . \\nsure . \\nwilliam baldwin isn't a bad actor . \\nunfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie . \\ni'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good . \\nif it was the latter , it worked . \\ncindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . \\nwhich is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement . \\nalthough to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . \\nso right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ? \\nwell , i'm glad you asked that question . \\ncindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . \\nwhy woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? \\nby the end of the movie you won't care . \\nthe story is so contrived it isn't funny . \\nanyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . \\nwho's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) . \\nthe point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud . \\nthe supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes . \\nif i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears . \\nas for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . \\nunfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . \\nthis movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . \\nit's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . \\nunless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you . \\n\",\n"," b\"okay , okay . \\nmaybe i wasn't in the mood to watch a mindless action movie ; i am the same person that liked lethal weapon iii , even while admitting that it wasn't as good as the others . \\nhowewer , the latest segal picture didn't look that bad , and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them , i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash . \\nboy , was i wrong ! \\nin the first half of the movie , we are already assaulted with segal's acting , ( he is not simply wooden ; he is like a wall ) , gratuitous violence , an incredible plot , sexist and even more gratuitous nudity , and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes . \\nby the end , it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers . \\nnot once in the movie did segal appear worried or undecided , which did not do much for increasing the unexistent suspense . \\nof course , in movies like these , there must be a sidekick , and a love interest . \\nin these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model ( in the movie ) , which only functions as a supposed comic relief ( by the way of extremely stupid unfunny lines ) , and to have watering eyes and look away every time something bad happens in the movie . \\noh , of course , she appears naked from the waist up , and , of course , segal kisses her at the end after no development of their relationship ; they did not even seem to be interested in each other . \\ni have never seen so little chemistry between two people in a movie . \\noften , the villain saves the movie ; unfortunately , the villains here are cartoonish , stupid and unfunny , unmenacing . \\nhow many movies have psycho ex-special forces bad guys ? \\ntoo many . \\ni was able to predict the action all throughout the movie , including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death , the scene where the bad guy can kill the hero but proceeds to explain his plan to him , the scene where we are shown the hero's superiors are stupid , the scene where the bad guy loses his gun and has to fight the hero hand to hand , etc . . . \\nsimply said , this is movie-making by the numbers , boring , and potentially offensive in going for the lowest common denominator of the audience . \\nmy recommendation : if you go see it , bring a watch . \\nyou'll be looking at it for most of the movie . \\nmy . \\nrent die hard . \\nread a book . \\nstare at the sky . \\ndo not waste your time on this worthless piece of celluloid . \\nthe real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen ; once again , dragged in by my friends , which by the way , liked the movie halfheartedly . \\nthey probably like wrestling too : - ) . \\n\",\n"," b'the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . \\nthe rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that\\'s exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . \\nlast year\\'s speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year\\'s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . \\nin some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . \\nwhatever uniqueness the original might\\'ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . \\njulie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . \\njulie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . \\nwill and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . \\nunfortunately , things aren\\'t so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . \\nit\\'s another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . \\nthere\\'s not much that\\'s original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it\\'s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . \\nfor die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . \\nthe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn\\'t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . \\nthe man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . \\nmuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . \\nthe whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . \\nand , whereas the killer\\'s identity might\\'ve been a question in the first movie , it\\'s almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . \\nthree or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as \" the killer . \" \\nthey\\'re almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . \\nand so , in the end , it\\'s left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . \\ngod help us . \\n',\n"," b'in _daylight_ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well . \\nyesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it . \\ni had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out . \\nit turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering . \\nso , i shrugged , thought , \" hey , they probably won\\'t give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , \" so i signed up . \\nall in all , i don\\'t think i got that bad of a deal , either . \\nrob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? \\nyou think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey . \\nsylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed . \\nwhen the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out . \\nthere are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _daylight_\\'s bad guy is mother nature . \\nin fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film \" sequels \" do to their predecessors . \\nthe first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup . \\nsubplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled . \\nwe meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others . \\nwe watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons . \\nand then , thirty minutes into the film , _boom_ . \\nand it\\'s a big one . \\n>from there on in , it\\'s sly stallone to the rescue . \\nand rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly-style . \\nagain . . . there\\'s \\nnothing new here . \\nand yet there doesn\\'t need to be . \\nthe fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution . \\nthe special-effects are first-rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together . \\nonce the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way . \\nthis review is copyright 1996 by christopher e . meadows . \\npermission granted for distribution

to make it interesting , \" the specialist \" is about as exciting as an episode of \" dragnet , \" and about as well acted . \\neven some attempts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy script , stupid and unlikable characters , and just plain nothingness . \\nwho knew a big explosion could be so boring and anti-climactic ? \\nunless you saw \" blown away \" . . . \\n \" the specliast \" of the title is none other than action star sylvester stallone ( in comeback #19 , i think ) , who plays a quiet , hermit-like bomber who was once a bomb expert with the army or something , but who suffered a change of heart when he and his assistant ( james woods , who shows us exactly what over-the-top is , other than another bad sly film ) accidentally killed some innocent people during a job . \\nhis credo is killing bad people , not innocents . \\nand that\\'s why he makes big bombs . \\nso anyway , into his life steps the seductive sharon stone , who is basically the girlfriend/moll of the stupid son ( eric roberts ) of a cuban/miami kingpin ( rod steiger , in an indecipherable accent , which is sometimes cuban , sometimes brando , sometimes scottish , etc ) . \\nturns out sharon is actually using her boyfriend so she can kill him , since he killed her parents when she was young . \\nso she calls sly , leaves messages with him , sends him e-mail , etc , about planting a bomb to kill roberts , which sly listens to obsessively , and while he works out naked . \\nyea . \\nalso into his life , though again , comes woods , who has been tipped off by stone to catch sly . \\nusing the cops , he tries to set up traps , none which really work , so when sly calls him , he goes ballisitic on his ass over the phone , getting so worked up by saying his must-be-improvised speeches that he seems to pop the vein in his head wide open . \\nthese are the most exciting scenes in the film , and woods becomes the only ounce of entertainment in the film . \\nthe film tries to offer us a moody film noir , except with explosions , but comes up completely snake-eyes . \\nit\\'s just a pretend film noir , making it a big waste of time . \\nand for action buffs , the action scenes are pretty lame , with some really unrealistic-looking special effects ( a penthouse being blown off of a hotel looks like a piece of cardboard falling into a tub ) . \\nthen there\\'s the much-discussed sex scene between sly and stone , which are about as mispaired a couple as rachel and ross on \" friends . \" \\ntheir sex scene is more nauseating then sexy , because it shows us more of sly than stone . \\nnow let\\'s guess who we\\'d rather see naked , okay ? \\nstone\\'s small but perky breasts , which we\\'ve seen more times than harvey keitel\\'s dick , or stallone\\'s veiny ass , which isn\\'t usually shown for a very good reason ? \\ni know i can\\'t really judge it as a flaw of the film , but come on . \\nthe worst flaw of the film is this : it\\'s boring . \\ni mean , i was on caffeine when watching it , but my friend fell asleep only to be woken up by james woods ranting . \\nbut a good movie does not james woods going nuts make . \\nif you\\'re in for some fun action , rent sly\\'s earlier \" demolition man , \" which sucks too , but in a much more entertaining fashion . \\nskip this dull film , unless you want to see woods , or make fun of steiger\\'s accent , or see stone\\'s breasts again . \\n',\n"," b'director andrew davis reworks his fugitive formula and the results are about as exciting as his last film-- the dreadful comedy steal big , steal little--

for a sabotaged science experiment that vaporized eight chicago city blocks . \\n ( the mushroom-cloud explosion is a knock-out and easily the best part of the movie . \\nor , as one audience member succinctly summed it up : \" whoa . \" ) \\nfalse information implicates their involvement and boy and girl are soon on the run , fleeing over open drawbridges , across icy lakes , and through the corridors of power at a top-secret , underground energy facility . \\naiding and abetting is the team\\'s shady mentor , played in an excellent-but-so- what performance by morgan freeman . \\n ( brit brian cox is also about , as the behind-the-scenes bad guy . \\nhe has some fun fiddling with a southern accent . ) \\nunfunny , overscored , and without a single shred of suspense , chain reaction is * the * summer movie to walk out on . \\nif you make it to the end , a mess of cross-cutting involving another imminent explosion , you\\'ll hear somebody say \" i guess it\\'s time to go . \" \\nheed that warning . \\n',\n"," b'gregg araki\\'s the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made . \\nso why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ? \\nfirst of all , some of the reviews were fairly positive . \\nalso , the cast , consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight , eve plumb , shannen doherty , and david leisure ) was promising . \\nlast of all , i wanted to give arraki one more chance . \\ni mean , the guy can\\'t be that untalented , can he ? \\nthe answer to that question is three letters long . \\nnowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles . \\nsince arraki doesn\\'t know how to make anything coherent , it\\'s hard to describe the plot . \\nlet\\'s just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won\\'t make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls . \\nthe only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star . \\nhe turns out to be a nice guy who doesn\\'t care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans . \\nthis story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming . \\nit is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki , and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez . \\ni thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft . \\nhe works better with the camera this time around , especially in the early scenes . \\nhalfway through the film , i didn\\'t necessarily find myself enjoying the film , but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation . \\nthen as the movie went on , arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads , twisted sex games , and alien abductions . \\nit\\'s sad , because he almost actually had some decent material here , but he ruined it with his usual in your face \" i\\'m such a renegade maverick filmmaker , look what i can do \" attitude . \\nthe performances are generally better than in the doom generation , which isn\\'t saying much . \\nat least we don\\'t have to suffer jonathan \" i am the most hideous man in america \" schaech . \\nwe are , however treated to another round of james \" i\\'m more wooden than keanu \" duval . \\nsarah lassez gives the best performance in the film , and kathleen robertson ( formerly of 90210 and now arraki\\'s wife ) and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess . \\nof the tv star cameos , john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist . \\nif i prefer nowhere to the doom generation , it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture . \\nmaybe greg arraki doesn\\'t want you to like his characters . \\nmaybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them . \\nmaybe he just wanted to piss me off . \\nif so , he was successful . \\n',\n"," b'when respecting a director , you must also respect the fact that they are not perfect . \\nwoody allen has made a couple less-than good films , and he\\'s my favorite . \\neven martin scorsese hasn\\'t had a perfect track record . \\nkevin smith , after a smashing debut with the classic \" clerks \" stooped as low to sell-out and make the dreadful \" mallrats . \" \\ni mean , so far the only director who\\'s made several films , none of which have been bad is richard linklater ( \" slacker , \" \" dazed and confused , \" \" before sunrise , \" and \" suburbia \" . . . all \\nwhich were great ) . \\nnow , i adore quentin tarantino . \\nhis first two films were classic films , the second one being one of the greatest films of all time . \\nbut 1995 just wasn\\'t that good of a year for him . \\nhe made way too many tv appearances . \\nhe mispronounced jackie chan\\'s name on the mtv movie awards . \\nand he made this film . \\n ( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) . \\nrobert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one . \\ni\\'ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can\\'t comment on them . \\nbut in this crap ensemble director\\'s film , all four give pitiful efforts . \\npitiful for any director , too . \\nnow in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out . \\ni\\'ve never seen all of \" new york stories , \" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody\\'s one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film . \\nexposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who\\'s a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year\\'s eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel . \\nhe\\'s the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) . \\nthe old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily . \\nas the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile . \\nyea . \\n ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : \\nthe missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt \\nthis one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue . \\nthe situation is so terrible that it\\'s physically painful to watch . \\nthe plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) \\nstuck inside some object in their hotel room . \\nthe witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it . \\nyeah , that\\'s what i said . \\nstupid plot , inane characters who aren\\'t interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully . \\nnot even actually funny for a second . \\nmy rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! \\nthe wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender \\nanother bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on . \\nted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at \" coming back \" ) who are playing sex games . \\nted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon . \\nbut at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much . \\nand david proval has never overacted as much . \\nand it\\'s \" pulp fiction \" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window . \\na masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . . \\nthe misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek \\nwould a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek\\'s navel ? \\nnope . \\nluckily she\\'s on the tv dancing so we get to see her . \\nsurprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential . \\nit was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny . \\nbut when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once . \\nantonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny . \\nbut , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it\\'s more painful than funny . \\nbut the ending was stupid and funny at the same time . \\noh ! \\nthe plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year\\'s party . \\nantonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it \\nwas okay . \\nthe man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) \\nironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film . \\nhe plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row . \\nthey\\'re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn\\'t light . \\nthey also pay him a lot of cash . \\nthis is so much exactly what this little film is about that it\\'s campy . \\ntim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves \\'cause they\\'ve had hits , major or minor . \\nit took quentin to realize that . \\nbut the thing is , it doesn\\'t seem like he realizes that . \\nif he did , i\\'d give this a good 3 stars . \\nbut this sucked . \\nit was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn\\'t very good . \\nhe starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes . \\nthat makes no sense . \\nit\\'s cool for a while , then he makes it uneven . \\nit\\'s long and it\\'s just not very good . \\nhopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one . \\nconclusion : what\\'s the moral here ? \\nif you\\'ve made celebrated films , don\\'t do an ensemble piece . \\nthey should have re-watched \" new york stories \" and then stopped in their tracks . \\nnone of these have any point to them and they\\'re embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors \\'cause they\\'re working with crap . \\nbut i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin\\'s next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool \" from dusk till dawn , \" which i found exhilerating ) . \\ni love quentin and i suppose it\\'s good he made \" the man from hollywood \" because it makes him seem more realistic and not some \" god of cinema . \" \\ni seem to respect directors if they aren\\'t \" gods \" and are actually human beings who make mistakes . \\n \" the man from hollywood \" is his big mistake and let\\'s hope he doesn\\'t return her continuously . \\n',\n"," b'not too many people know who james whale is , but it\\'s a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies . \\nif we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way . \\nthis is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie . \\ngods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale\\'s life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it\\'s probably a better movie for it . \\nit\\'s focus is on whale\\'s ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) . \\nit begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to \" sit for him , \" ( pose for a portrait ) . \\nat first , boone doesn\\'t realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man . \\nwhen he does discover whale\\'s sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy . \\nbut he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale\\'s \" locker room talk . \" \\nboone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned \" locker room talk , \" and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening . \\nmeanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago . \\nhis ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor . \\nwhat is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser\\'s bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) . \\ni was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here . \\nthis is impressive because his character\\'s dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking . \\nthat requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well . \\nthis is not to ignore mckellan\\'s oscar nominated turn . \\nhe earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem . \\nwhale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield . \\nhe rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people . \\nin the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n',\n"," b'guilt . guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time ; the penultimate t & a thriller , basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living . \\nbut i know so well that it\\'s a terrible film , made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt . \\nverhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and , on november seventh , 1997 , unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me , who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies . \\nthe pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year . \\na simple , white on black title card reads \" starship troopers \" -my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped , verhoeven realized he forgot the credits . \\nis this how a hundred million dollar movie should open ? \\nwere the rest of the film that subdued . . . \\nstarship troopers is about a group of white , blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names . \\nthey graduate high school , join the military , and then , rather curiously , decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet . \\nthe story is so incomprehensible , and told so bombastically , it\\'s akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue . \\n ( aside , club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn\\'t changed in the future . ) \\none plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences , specifically the newsreels of the future . \\nhysterically funny , actually . \\nbut the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between . \\nthe storytelling lacks focus , to say the least . \\nthe politics of the film are scary . \\nthe actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos . \\nthere\\'s even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out , nude , with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater , just the way he seems to like it . \\ni use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor i\\'ve encountered in a big budget picture ; all chiseled features and machismo , he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders . \\nof course , verhoeven\\'s probably the one to blame , and perhaps i\\'m jealous because i\\'m so disgusting . \\nat any rate , a movie called starship troopers shouldn\\'t be about sex . \\nexactly ten years ago , verhoeven made robocop , which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving . \\nand r-rated , despite its goofy premise . \\nmaybe it\\'s asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg-movie , then-he\\'s a master of insipid violence . \\nhowever , ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it . \\n',\n"," b' \" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . \\nthat\\'s right . \\nthe major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . \\nthis central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic . \\nhis name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . \\nsimon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . \\nthe fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" \\ni suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon\\'s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . \\nmiko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he\\'s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . \\nit\\'s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn\\'t playing like he\\'s autistic . \\nunlike dustin hoffman\\'s performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio\\'s in \" what\\'s eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . \\nhowever , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character\\'s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . \\nhell , he doesn\\'t even have to be shy . \\nin fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis\\' arm . \\nwillis\\' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . \\nhe becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon\\'s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . \\nof course , we know that isn\\'t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents . \\nsimon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . \\njeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . \\nthis is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon\\'s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . \\nlate in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . \\nof all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . \\ni can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey\\'s character is far too accommodating . \\nnot only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o\\'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . \\nthe grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . \\nthe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn\\'t rise to the challenge . \\nthe movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . \\nthere is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . \\nthe grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it\\'s more suspenseful that way . \\ntaken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . \\nusually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . \\nthis is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . \\nmaybe the book was better , but the way it\\'s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore . \\n',\n"," b'ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad . \\nthe review \\njean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says \" been there , done that . \" \\nno film critic could possibly sum up van damme\\'s recent film choices any better . \\nwhile other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns . \\nthis unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex . \\nhe joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away . \\nuniversal soldier : the return is truly poor . \\nthe plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier . \\nsoldier\\'s kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger\\'s terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers . \\nconsidering the poor box office performance of soldier , it\\'s amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead . \\nluc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form . \\nin this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program . \\nworking with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth . \\nunfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside . \\nthe rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg ) . \\nthere are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility . \\nthere are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch . \\nluc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing . \\nerin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she \" isn\\'t leaving without her story \" . \\nwhatever . \\nother laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) . \\nnot one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it . \\nwhen fuelled by don davis\\' loud , driving music score , the film\\'s many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol\\' jean-claude moves . \\ndirector mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found . \\nhis past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion . \\nif only jean-claude weren\\'t getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film . \\nto place the blame squarely at van damme\\'s feet , however , is an injustice . \\ni\\'m not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano\\'s script sound good . \\none particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access . \\nhe cringes , looks down and mutters \" uh . . . uhm . . . \\nthey all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . \\neh he he he \" the script\\'s and indeed the entire film\\'s only saving grace is goldberg . \\nhe chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . \\nhe even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like \" i really don\\'t like that guy \" every time he fails to kill luc . \\nsadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video . \\n',\n"," b'it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as \" raising arizona \" and \" the hudsucker proxy , \" made their feature film debut with \" blood simple , \" a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas . \\nit bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens\\' recent \" fargo , \" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; \" blood simple \" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end . \\nthe premise of \" blood simple \" is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m . \\nemmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz ) . \\nthings start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme . \\nto reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening . \\nevery act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator\\'s eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the \" big picture \" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person . \\nthis aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film . \\nthe coens might have done well to title the film \" fear and loathing in texas . \" \\nsome have labeled \" blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else . \\nthe coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive . \\nthat said , \" blood simple \" is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine . \\nthe coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film . \\nthat said , \" blood simple \" is not exactly flawless . \\nfor one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder . \\nand although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren\\'t quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it\\'s-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes . \\nthe film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film . \\n \" blood simple \" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it\\'s a decent movie and it showcases the coens\\' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner . \\ni would firmly recommend it to all \" coen-heads \" as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller . \\n',\n"," b'i\\'m really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone . \\nsure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god\\'s green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . \\nthe crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff . \\nhideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . \\nclueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . \\nand people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i\\'m the only one who doesn\\'t like it . \\none girl said if i\\'d seen the movie with \" an open mind , \" i would have enjoyed it . \\nnothing could be further from the truth . \\ni went into the theater expecting to love the movie . \\nthe preview looked good and of course i\\'m crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . \\nalmost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . \\nwhen we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it wasn\\'t me ) yelled out , \" that was the worst f$&#in\\' movie i\\'ve ever seen \" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . \\nso last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia\\'s pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter . \\ni knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i\\'ll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . \\nwhat i got was 90 minutes of regret--the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . \\nand you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . \\nwhere to begin in criticizing this movie ? \\nthe plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she\\'s still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever . \\nthere is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . \\nzero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . \\nso why does this movie get one star out of me ? \\nwell , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . \\nand if it wasn\\'t bubble bath , the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features , but you settle for what you can get . \\nalicia plays a babysitter who\\'s spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party . \\nand of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home ( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) . \\nas the movie trods along , we discover she\\'s not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character\\'s fantasies ( and probably every male viewer\\'s too ) . \\nthe drunken father thinks she\\'s just the thing to recapture his lost youth , her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole while she\\'s taking her bubble bath . \\nthey even throw in the middle aged wife\\'s fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . \\nnot that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy . \\nat least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . \\nin fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple if not for the fact that there\\'s absolutely no nudity in it . \\nso you can\\'t call it a sex flick . \\ni\\'ve already pointed out that it can\\'t fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action , so what do you classify the babysitter as ? \\nbad . \\n',\n"," b'assume nothing . \\nthe phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990\\'s , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be . \\nthe phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself . \\nnovak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out . \\none of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman . \\ncharles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor . \\nseeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass . \\ncharles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes . \\nthe point ? \\nto make sure she\\'s not seeing someone else , of course . \\noscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go . \\noscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy . \\nwell , another popular phrase of the 90\\'s is \" all good things must come to an end , \" and this stays true for oscar as well . \\ncharles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn\\'t seem to mind . \\nwhy is this ? \\nhe thinks oscar is gay . \\nhe\\'s not afraid to share this with him either . \\noscar stands in shock after the words , \" i swear if you weren\\'t gay oscar , i\\'d have to kill you , \" are muttered flamboyantly from charles\\' mouth . \\nthe word spreads instantly through town . \\nwill oscar \" come out \" of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn\\'t ? \\none would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles . \\nmatthew perry doesn\\'t escape his character as chandler on the already classic t . v . \\ncomedy \" friends , \" as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shy , and sensitive . \\nnonetheless , perry is hilarious here , and shows that he can handle drama , as obviously , his character suffers quite a bit here . \\nit\\'s wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcoming scream 3 ) as she handles comedy superbly here . \\nher voice , smile , and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies- stay with this genre , neve . \\nneve is delightful as her conflicted character , who feels love for oscar , but knows , based on rumors , that he is gay . \\nas usual , campbell is likable as her likable character . \\nunlike the other two leads here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue , and is never convincing . \\nwhen his character his present , mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting . \\nstick to the t . v . \\ndrama , the practice , dylan . \\nthe major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano . \\nno originality or technique is used whatsoever . \\nthree to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy , or else the film would have been a disaster , as it is just plain boring to look at . \\nthree to tango is a film done many times before , as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998\\'s the object of my affection , but the plot has never been completed so well . \\nthree to tango\\'s script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funny , delivering not only original , hilarious gay jokes ( not your run of the mill material ) , but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling . \\nunlike last summer\\'s south park : bigger , longer , and uncut and 1997\\'s in & out , three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar . \\nthe script is wise to take this route , as gays can\\'t ( i don\\'t think so , anyway ) be offended by this light , playful comedy . \\n ( to prove this , a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly . ) \\nthree to tango\\'s climax is a hilarious , clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic-mistaken identity comedies . \\nthree to tango is a gem . \\nthe bottom line : three to tango is a light , sharp , snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending , and great stars . \\none of the better romantic comedies of 1999 . \\n',\n"," b' \" it was not scary . \" \\nthese are the first words that came to mind after it was over . \\nwhen a movie is called _vampires_ , \" not scary \" aren\\'t words that should be associated with it . \\nbut that wasn\\'t my only gripe . \\njohn carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema , as in the intense scares of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ . \\nunfortunately , the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach . \\nwith an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter\\'s vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan . \\nthe film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led by james woods , of all people . \\nlike some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack . \\ntheir method is amusingly innovative : the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks . \\nto commemorate their victory , the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away . \\ntheir celebration is short-lived , however , as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single-handedly destroys most of the team . \\nwoods\\' jack crow and buddy montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escape with their lives , along with a woman named katrina ( sheryl lee ) . \\nalthough the woman has been bitten , montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire . \\nthe rest of the movie is concerned with the boys\\' hunt for valek ( thomas ian griffith ) , a freaky marilyn manson-type who\\'s on a mission that dates back 600 years . \\nalong the way they pick up a priest named guiteau ( tim guinee ) , a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl . \\nupham in _saving private ryan_ . \\nsome stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but i can\\'t remember most of it , because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen . \\n_vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest . \\nonly then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick . \\nbut it\\'s too little too late . \\nwe get the inevitable final confrontation , but it seems tacked on and rather anti-climactic ( come on , we\\'re dealing with _the_ master vampire here ! ) \\ninterestingly , last summer\\'s vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former , a more deliberate superhero flick . \\nwoods\\' jack crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride . \\nand his motive for killing vampires ? \\ntake a wild guess . \\n ( hint : a ______ killed his _____ when he was just a _____ . ) \\nat least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness . \\n_vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot . \\nto make up for this , the movie resorts to other \" shocks , \" such as its generally condescending attitude towards women ( crow slaps them around for the fun of it ) and an overplayed contempt for religion ( crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to \" getting woodies . \" ) \\nit can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie . \\nif not scary and gory , i wanted tense , relentless , and exhausting . \\n_john carpenter\\'s vampires_ is none of these . \\ni can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan . \\nfor the rest of you looking for a good scare , beware : _vampires_ is a film with no teeth . \\n',\n"," b'a number of critics have decided that it\\'s open season on freddie prize jr . , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound-alike , disposable teen fluff like \" head over heels , \" \" boys and girls , \" \" down to you \" and \" she\\'s all that . \" \\nwhile the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not . \\ni first saw him in the independent dark comedy \" the house of yes , \" where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america\\'s freakiest families . \\nprinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown-up movies to show the non-believers that he has what it takes . \\n \" summer catch \" certainly won\\'t help his case . \\ninoffensive , but utterly generic , the baseball-related romantic comedy does little more than kill time . \\nthe story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big-time baseball star . \\nryan\\'s preoccupation with his new honey-bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team . \\nit\\'s a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad , bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates . \\nthe filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character-heavy baseball movie like \" bull durham , \" but haven\\'t got a clue how to get there . \\nand so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minutes . \\nthe only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center-fielder from texas . \\nin an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon-fighting riley finn from \" buffy the vampire slayer , \" hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , \" he does have a nice ass . \\na bubble butt . \" \\nwhen lillard gives him an \" are you insane ? \" \\nlook , blucas calmly says , \" it\\'s nothing sexual , \" then goes on to evaluate the hind-ends of some other players , including lillard\\'s . \\nspeaking of asses , prinze does not bare his in the movie . \\nthe actor has a no nudity clause in his contract , so two stunt-butts were employed for a couple of semi-nude shots . \\nblucas , whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story , gets another unique moment late in the film . \\nsick of hearing teammates make \" fat chick \" jokes , he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply-sized ladies . \\nwhile his speech still ends up objectifying women , it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie . \\ntrivial tidbit : \" summer catch \" marks a scooby doo summit . \\nmarc blucas appears in \" jay and silent bob strike back \" as fred from the scooby doo gang , while freddie prinze jr . plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon . \\n',\n"," b'anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon\\'s fact based novel the king and i , and it\\'s big , expensive and soulless . \\nthough good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson\\'s script . \\nso much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting . \\nthis is jodie foster\\'s first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn\\'t the best choice to show off her acting chops . \\nshe\\'s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king\\'s ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because \" the ways of england are the ways of the world ) . \\nthe king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) . \\nthe eldest prince is none too happy about this ( \" father , have i offended you in some way ? \\nwhy do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her . \\nmeanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma . \\nthe king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain\\'s doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position . \\nshe is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king\\'s prejudices . \\nhe , though self-righteous as ever , can\\'t help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other . \\nthere is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king\\'s younger daughters dies . \\nit\\'s your classic deathbed scene , with the girl\\'s mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure . \\nanna then comes in and cries a bit . \\nthe sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer . \\ni\\'m usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched . \\nthis remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren . \\nwe never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care . \\nthis ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 . \\ni do not doubt tennant\\'s ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient . \\nthe sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur . \\neven terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia . \\nwe feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe . \\ni liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles . \\nfoster\\'s generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character . \\nyun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam\\'s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts . \\nwhat does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations . \\nthe cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole . \\nthis is an emotionless costume epic . \\n',\n"," b'truman ( \" true-man \" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey\\'s character in

just happens to keep him in his own little town . \\nhis last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world . \\nyou know by now that truman\\'s life is the subject of a television program . \\nhis actions are \" real \" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife . \\ntruman is determined to find out what the big hoax is . \\nmeanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman\\'s world does his best to keep him unaware and happy . \\nit\\'s sort of like westworld told from the robots\\' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs\\' point of view . \\nwe root for the captive of the cage-world . \\nour protagonist is counting on \" chaos theory \" to help him escape his elaborate trap . \\nthe story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake . \\nalthough these questions came to mind , i don\\'t think the film itself asked them . \\nit certainly didn\\'t address them or try to answer them . \\ni was particularly disappointed that the film didn\\'t deal more with the trauma of learning one\\'s life is a tv show . \\ncarrey\\'s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman\\'s pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film\\'s pacing . \\nearlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well . \\nthe two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn\\'t see it that way . \\nperhaps it\\'s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn\\'t , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here . \\nbut on its own terms , the movie is well made . \\nsight , sound and pacing are all handled competently . \\nmuch of the first part of the movie is the truman show . \\nthe scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen . \\none hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen . \\nthe music is well-chosen and scored . \\nthe film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman\\'s world is still beautiful and perfect . \\nwhen the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre . \\nphilip glass\\' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman\\'s scenes of suspicion and awakening . \\n ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . ) \\nand the pacing of the story was brisk . \\nthere was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie . \\none of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman\\'s idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn\\'t necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner . \\nthere\\'s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down . \\nit\\'s a quick , straight shot to the movie\\'s end . \\nin terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol\\'s gattaca . \\nboth films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds . \\nbut neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film \" clicked \" and became an instant classic . \\nnevertheless , i look forward to niccol\\'s next film , whatever it may be . \\n',\n"," b'some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled , making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen . \\ni finished mike figgis\\' \" leaving las vegas \" hours ago , and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr . \\nalot of people refer to this film as \" that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude \" . \\n \" leaving las vegas \" is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are : a drunk and a whore . \\nben ( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years ) is the drunk . \\nhis family and friends have long since abandon him , and all he has left is his liquor . \\nin a scene early in the film , we see ben staggering into a resteraunt , looking for a \" friend \" of his to mooch some money off of . \\nhe finds the guy ( richard lewis ) having dinner with a buddy and two chicks , trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid . \\nwhen ben approaches the table , you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable . \\nafter lewis gives ben the money , he coldly says \" i think it would be best if you didn\\'t contact me again . \" \\nnow even though through the course of the film , some much more depressing things happen , this is when i felt the most for ben . \\nthere was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face , ( not to sound hokey or anything ) it almost brought a tear to my eye . \\nit turns out that ben was once a semi-successful hollywood player , and apparently a pretty popular guy . \\nnow he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women , not so much for the sex , but for the company ; for someone to talk to or spend time with . \\nonce he is fired from his job , ben decides to burn all his belongings , collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death . \\none night he runs into a prostitute ( a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue - how far she has come since \" adventures in babysitting \" ) named sera . \\nshe is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp , a scumbag who gets-off by cutting her . \\nthey are both very lonely , self-destructive people . \\nthey immediatly hit it off , both of them realizing that they need one another . \\nand it isn\\'t even a sexual relationship . \\nthey don\\'t even have sex until , like , the last ten minutes of the film . \\n \" leaving las vegas \" is not a film about plot . \\nwith the exception of what i have already revealed ( which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so , by the way ) , there isn\\'t too much of a story to it . \\nit is more a film about people and how they react to one another . \\nfrom what i can see , this is basically a perfect film . \\nthe direction is great ( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody , smokey atmosphere of a film noir ) and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s , or any other decade for that matter . \\nbut don\\'t go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you\\'re getting yourself into . \\nfirst off , if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge , stay away from \" leaving las vegas \" . \\nit is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms , rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon ( that\\'s right ) . \\nsecondly , if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film , don\\'t see it . \\nhowever , if you are cool with those two things , you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have . \\n',\n"," b'there\\'s a scene early on in \" jawbreaker \" where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line , \" that is * so * not funny \" . \\nhow right she was . \\nthis pathetic tale of three high-schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny . \\nor fun . \\nor original . \\nnot content with the too-obvious \" heathers \" heisting , the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources , including \" carrie \" , \" bride of frankenstein \" , \" blue velvet \" , and even shaw\\'s pygmalion , itself recently remade as \" she\\'s all that \" . \\n \" jawbreaker \" is a pastiche , and not even an enjoyable one . \\ni find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence , a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt\\'s \" volcano girls \" ; serving as a blueprint for the rest of the film , the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we\\'re watching . \\njust close your eyes and pretend you\\'re listening to an alt-rock station ; you won\\'t be missing anything . \\nthe blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the principals . \\nrebecca gayheart , following roles in \" scream 2 \" and \" urban legend \" , should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie . \\npam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantino\\'s \" jackie brown \" . \\nand rose mcgowan should just quit acting . \\nshe has no charisma , no presence , and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected . \\nmcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real-life boyfriend , rocker marilyn manson , whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the \" real \" actors are doing . \\nmanson , sans trademark makeup & contact lenses , and with an obviously fake moustache , looks eerily like nicholas cage ; who woulda thunk it ? \\nthat crack about direction by committee wasn\\'t merely a pithy sound-bite . \\nstylistically , thematically & narratively , \" jawbreaker \" is all over the map , varying wildly in tone & content from scene to scene . \\nthough credited solely to writer/director darren stein , one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands . \\nif stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity , someone needs to get the man some drugs , pronto . \\nprozac , lithium , kava , ritalin , something , anything . \\nhe\\'s quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help . \\n \" jawbreaker \" is a monumental waste of effort and resources , and quite likely one of the single worst films i\\'ve ever seen . \\nto call \" jawbreaker \" garbage would be to insult garbage . \\nbad flicks for the rest of the year are safe ; i\\'ve already got my pick for worst film of \\'99 . \\n \" jawbreaker \" runs approximately 90 minutes , though it feels longer than \" titanic \" , and is rated r for language , sexual situations and graphic violence . \\nnot recommended for kids , teens , or anyone else . \\n',\n"," b'if beavis and butthead had a favorite movie , from dusk till dawn would probably be it . \\nscripted by quentin tarantino and directed by robert rodriguez ( desperado ) , the movie panders to the very worst in sex and violence -- and is incredibly fun to watch . \\nit starts off as a pulp fiction-type crime story , with criminal brothers george clooney and tarantino robbing a convenience store . \\nbecause this is a tarantino movie , however , it\\'s not just a case of pull the gun and take the loot , it\\'s a case of a hole being shot through someone\\'s hand , a man on fire jumping out behind the counter and the entire store blowing up as they drive away . \\nthe opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie -- everything overdone and nothing as it seems . \\nclooney and tarantino bring a hostage to the motel and then hijack an rv with a family in it . \\nharvey keitel plays the backslidden ex-preacher and juliette lewis his daughter , whom registered sex-pervert tarantino eyes endlessly . \\nyou know you\\'re mentally unbalanced when you find lewis the least bit attractive , although she\\'s not nearly as obnoxious as usual in from dusk till dawn . \\nthe first half of the movie has the criminals and hostages trying to get to and through the mexico border , clooney\\'s strategy involving hiding in the rv shower while lewis is on the toilet . \\nit does its trick ; the border guard takes one look at lewis relieving herself and immediately goes blind , never noticing clooney or tarantino . \\nonce they get to mexico , it\\'s time to wait at the rendezvous point , a topless bar called titty twister where we\\'re once again reminded tarantino wrote the movie as he drinks champagne off the foot of a stripper . \\nfinally , after about ten minutes of intercut boob shots and clooney forcing keitel and lewis to drink with him , the stripper turns into a vampire . \\nsoon half the people in the bar are vampires and the other half fall or fight back . \\nthat\\'s right , we\\'ve come all this way to see a vampire movie . \\nbut like everything else , tarantino takes this age-old genre and twists it to his own ends to produce over-the-top entertainment . \\nso we get holy water condom balloons , heads rolling , quadruple impalement on an overturned table and keitel getting bitten by a vampire and announcing he only has a few minutes left before he becomes \" a lap dog of satan . \" \\nthe from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100% tarantino , hovering between absurd and disgusting ( as when they\\'re entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister ) , but always entertaining , and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second-rate gorefest . \\nclooney , keitel and especially tarantino are so over-the-top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious , ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously . \\nstuff like this would be terrible in any other movie , but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people , even if there\\'s absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn . \\npulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason , but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment . \\nfrom dusk till dawn isn\\'t the classic of modern cinema that pf is , but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie . \\n',\n"," b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\n \" all the world\\'s a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts \" - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 \\nwhen william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash . \\nthis is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show . \\ntruman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life . \\nhe has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise . \\nor so it would seem . \\nbizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman\\'s life . \\na lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky . \\na rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term \\'isolated\\' follows him around . \\na radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move . \\nfor the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be . \\nthe truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next . \\nbalancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy . \\nin many ways , mr . niccol\\'s screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea . \\nalthough the film\\'s rather conventional climax doesn\\'t sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception . \\ndespite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible . \\nthe tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false . \\nthe end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs . \\nthe system formula . \\nwhile the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking . \\nthe device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman\\'s growing awareness isn\\'t exactly convincing . \\nthere\\'s not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film . \\nin fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman\\'s artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling . \\nstill , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city . \\ni\\'ve always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans . \\ncheerfully going over the top , it\\'s hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she\\'d have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ? \\nms . linney is a delight in the film . \\nbut it is mr . carrey who rules the show here . \\nhe may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it\\'s difficult not to root for truman . \\nin a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there\\'s an early scene where he\\'s down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags . \\nit\\'s almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who\\'s constantly the centre of attention . \\nin addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman\\'s antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz\\'s original score . \\ntechnical credits are first-rate all around . \\nwhile the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it\\'s not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965\\'s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner . \\nall the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent . \\nthe curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film\\'s concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it\\'s abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario . \\nperhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question . \\nperhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world . \\n',\n"," b'robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people . \\nin \" the natural \" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be \" the best there ever was , \" but still acted like a humble farm boy . \\nin \" butch cassidy and the sundance kid \" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer . \\neven in \" indecent proposal \" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love . \\nin his latest film , \" the horse whisperer , \" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character . \\nredford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up . \\ndespite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase \" horse whisperer \" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life . \\nbooker\\'s talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident . \\nthe accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace\\'s friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace\\'s horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg . \\nannie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker . \\nat first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn\\'t work . \\ninstead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) . \\nin many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically . \\nthe move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it\\'s hard not to see annie and grace\\'s leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country . \\nin \" the horse whisperer , \" country is clearly the victor . \\nthe city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace\\'s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie\\'s controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people . \\nredford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed \" a river runs through it \" six years ago . \\nin many ways , \" the horse whisperer \" comes from the same poetic vein as \" river , \" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains . \\nbut then , that would ruin the magic . \\nmuch of the film\\'s photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land . \\nto further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( \" natural born killers , \" \" platoon \" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . \\nin terms of the story itself , \" the horse whisperer \" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean\\'s \" a brief encounter \" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood\\'s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller\\'s \" the bridges of madison county \" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted \" bridges \" ) . \\nalthough \" the horse whisperer \" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story . \\nit seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who\\'s being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is . \\nin \" the horse whisperer , \" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill . \\nhe plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him . \\nhe is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man . \\nthere is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character . \\nit shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap . \\nas they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him . \\nit\\'s a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie\\'s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness . \\nafter all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it . \\nthe best scenes in \" the horse whisperer \" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse . \\nalthough booker\\'s horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing . \\nthese are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true . \\nat some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more . \\nnevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film . \\nthere are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together . \\nalthough the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make \" the horse whisperer \" worth the price of admission . \\n',\n"," b\"in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america . \\nthis ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was . \\nshe was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was . \\nfinally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not . \\nto get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson . \\njack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time . \\nrose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping . \\nthus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . . \\nthis movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia . \\nthe movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly . \\nnow the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story . \\nit serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating . \\nthis movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough . \\nthe story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective . \\nmovies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency . \\nthe attention to detail that was paid is remarkable . \\nthe whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie . \\npart of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast . \\nthe performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired . \\nthe characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles . \\nlooking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie . \\nthe casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is . \\none character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself . \\nyes , you read correctly , the ship is a character . \\nhow is the titanic a character ? \\nyou ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you . \\nthis character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this . \\nmr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense . \\nall this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp . \\nnow , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards . \\nthe effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking . \\nin some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) . \\nthe technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique . \\nthe movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship . \\nthe movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes . \\nnow that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end . \\nthe historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done . \\nthe method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less . \\nregardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at . \\nthe simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing . \\nif you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! ! \\nit might not be the best movie in the world . . \\nbut it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it . \\nduring none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie . \\n\",\n"," b'for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and \" high art , \" the son\\'s room is an inventive , subtle alternative . \\nwritten by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement . \\nslow is the best description for the film at first . \\nit

process of grieving . \\nthough nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn\\'t come across as a vanity piece . \\none might wish he hadn\\'t picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character\\'s reactions so predictable . \\nwhat saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction . \\nthe potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss . \\nyou start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing . \\nyou remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation . \\neven better are the role reversals that take place within the household . \\nwhile giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot . \\nnot only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she\\'ll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them . \\nthese scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change . \\nrespectfully , gender issues never enter the picture . \\nself-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family . \\nthough giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives . \\nmost films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing . \\nin contrast , the son\\'s room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters . \\nit\\'s not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to . \\n',\n"," b' ( dimension films , \" scream 2 \" \\'s distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film\\'s twisty plot . \\nthat\\'s no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there\\'s a first ) . ) \\n \" the first one was [good] , but all the rest sucked , \" said a cinematically-savvy teen in last winter\\'s wes craven thriller \" scream , \" her statement referring to the films of the \" nightmare on elm street \" series but really putting down franchise overkill in general . \\nthe comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas . \\nbut like it or not , along comes \" scream 2 . \" and believe it or not , it\\'s a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood\\'s sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions . \\n \" scream 2 \" is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride . \\nit\\'s been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california . \\nthose surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives . \\nplucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture-whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along . \\ntrash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called \" stab . \" \\nand dewey riley ( david arquette ) , still suffering from wounds inflicted during \" scream , \" has left his job as a police officer for a while . \\nlife is tranquil . . . \\nat least for a while . \\nseveral sudden murders bring sidney , randy , gale and dewey together again , but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these four people learned anything from the past , it\\'s to trust no one . \\nthus , the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o\\'connell ) , sidney\\'s new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale\\'s cameraman who\\'s not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney\\'s sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not-too-friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy\\'s good friend and fellow film student . \\ncotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother\\'s murder in scream , also shows up on campus -- but why ? \\nlike the first scream , craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang . \\nthis time , it\\'s an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of \" stab , \" making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema . \\nbefore tragedy ensues at the screening , the movie-within-a-movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments , including a scene from \" stab \" which turns scream\\'s now-famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear . \\n ( \" b---- , hang up the phone and star-69 his a-- ! \" \\npinkett yells at the screen . ) \\nit\\'s funny , creepy stuff ( i don\\'t think i\\'ll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road . \\nanother flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters . \\nthere are other superb set pieces , but explaining them risks ruining their effect . \\nthere are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count . \\nit\\'s something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original \" scream \" gang , but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar . \\nit can be argued that , while the original might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier . \\nit certainly doesn\\'t skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart ( i actually questioned craven and williamson\\'s judgment here , considering how much this person has added to these films ) . \\nsometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we\\'re shown are dead-on -- but for film fans , there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like \" the usual suspects , \" \" aliens \" and \" the empire strikes back . \" \\nstill , \" scream 2 \" does so many things right , it\\'s petty to quibble . \\nits penchant for parody is irresistible , discussions of the merits of film sequels and all . \\nthe attractive , solid cast is a definite bonus . \\nand the denouement ( while not as shocking as \" scream \" \\'s ) is priceless ; the film\\'s final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in \" scream \" with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper . \\nall this and a \" scream 3 \" is in the works . \\nknowing the series\\' tendency for self-reference , perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice . \\nmentioning \" scream 2 \" \\'ll help them in their argument . \\n',\n"," b'another formula \\'feel good\\' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like \" waking ned devine , \" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \\nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \\nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \\nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \\nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \\nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the \\'war on drugs\\' is about to be escalated into colombia . \\nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america\\'s jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america\\'s drug usage and drug supply . \\nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \\neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \\nthe film\\'s mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \\nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \\nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \\nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \\nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \\nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband\\'s enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \\nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \\nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \\neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \\nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \\nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \\nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \\nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \\nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace\\'s greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can\\'t control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \\nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn\\'t want matthew to end up in jail . \\nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \\nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \\nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \\nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \\nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \\nthis \\'unhip\\' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \\nummm ! \\n',\n"," b'some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies . \\nthat is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don\\'t tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film . \\nsuch rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in . \\nsomething like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community . \\none day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california . \\nvan dorn is worried because he doesn\\'t believe that his daughter would run from home . \\nhowever , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film . \\ninfuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast\\'s investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself . \\nunfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless . \\nthings change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) . \\nalmost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars . \\nit is a real shame , because very few movies in today\\'s hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt . \\nin late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience . \\nfor schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s . \\non one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great . \\nbut that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons . \\nthe new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called \" sexual revolution \" , same as all other \" revolutions \" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity . \\ninstead of being \" liberated \" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms . \\nschrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren\\'t so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job . \\nthe difference between the two is simply in the line of work . \\nmany contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda . \\non the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest . \\nin the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn\\'t deserve to experience parent\\'s worst nightmare . \\nthe scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen\\'s fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda . \\nvan dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body . \\non the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn\\'s ( his own parents wouldn\\'t allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin . \\neven the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end . \\nunfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale . \\nthe script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn\\'t show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver . \\napart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike . \\nbut the content might be more than interesting for today\\'s viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival . \\nuntil boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s . \\nhardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists . \\nthe view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn\\'t be too surprising . \\nanyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema . \\n',\n"," b'i feel no hesitation in saying that \" there\\'s something about mary \" is the best film that i will see all year . \\nfrom the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 . \\nit is that good of a film . \\nwhen gene siskel said this about \" fargo \" only a few months into \\'96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous . \\nhow could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? \\nbut after seeing the farrelly\\'s hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about . \\nonce in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer . \\nand you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special . \\nnow for the shocker ; \" mary \" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( \" pink flamingos \" obviously notwithstanding ) . \\nthe movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) . \\nforget \" blazing saddles \" , \" animal house \" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , \" monty python\\'s meaning of life \" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly\\'s assault on the senses . \\nin fact , this may even be the funniest film i\\'ve ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is \" monty python and the holy grail \" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade . \\nbut as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of \" mary \" ; it has a huge heart . \\nyou see , the farrelly\\'s are truly gifted filmmakers . \\nthey don\\'t just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) . \\nthey also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses . \\nit\\'s funny , though . \\nif you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable . \\nbut believe me , it is anything but . \\nben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) . \\nafter he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w . \\nearly brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from \" scream \" ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom . \\nin one of the film\\'s funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won\\'t ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again . \\njump to the present . \\nafter years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school . \\nhealy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself . \\nadmittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired . \\nafter all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ? \\nsomehow , the farrelly\\'s pull it off . \\nthe performances here are also right on target . \\nas ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable . \\nand cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary\\'s brother . \\nno other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here . \\ni know he won\\'t be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february . \\nas good as the actors are , though , it\\'s the directors\\' movie all the way . \\ni guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg\\'s wwii epic \" saving private ryan \" . \\nand yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting . \\nbut which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can\\'t breath for minutes at a time ? \\ni\\'ll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns . \\nthere is just something about \" mary \" . \\n',\n"," b'it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival\\'s palme d\\'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . \\nsince then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn . \\nin between , he has moonlighted as an \" actor \" with several decidedly unmemorable performances . \\nnow , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . \\nand , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard\\'s novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . \\nfor the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . \\nthe story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses . \\nand the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , \\'70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens\\' bare feet . \\nyet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . \\nthe sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . \\nthe mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn\\'t match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino\\'s previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . \\nand there aren\\'t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . \\nthere\\'s a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that\\'s about it . \\njackie brown\\'s lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . \\nthis isn\\'t exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa\\'s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick\\'s courage under fire . \\nhowever , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino\\'s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it\\'s unconventional . \\nhad the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . \\nas a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . \\nfor the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a \\'70s icon . \\nthis time around , instead of john travolta , it\\'s blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . \\nin one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier\\'s career , tarantino uses a \\'70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . \\nthere are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) . \\ngrier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . \\nshe\\'s working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . \\nno longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv\\'s \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . \\njackie passes ordell\\'s test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell\\'s money into the united states without tipping off the feds . \\nsoon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell\\'s perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . \\nunsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn\\'t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . \\nin addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . \\nrobert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles . \\nbridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino\\'s foot fetish . \\nrobert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor . \\nthe film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . \\ntarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . \\nwhen it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort . \\nit\\'s an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender . \\n',\n"," b'susan granger\\'s review of \" america\\'s sweethearts \" ( columbia/sony ) \\nwhat a waste of a talented cast ! \\nbilly crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it\\'s obvious that they\\'re attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy . \\nthe story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone . \\nhe figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film\\'s once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they\\'ll be so distracted that they won\\'t remember they didn\\'t see the movie or it wasn\\'t what they expected . \\n ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! ) \\nfor help , he turns to gwen\\'s personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) . \\nbut the laughs are few and far-between . \\ncrystal\\'s glib , cynical flack isn\\'t wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners . \\nafter six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack\\'s

lily taylor \" , since she\\'s basically the only character who had any real depth , background or reason to be in the house in the first place . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong , catherine zeta was sweet

sad , cause certainly the \" idea \" seemed like a good one ( see the shining ( 9/10 ) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry ) , but the story was thin , the conclusion was laughable (

not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch . \\nand while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end . \\namerican pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season . \\ni must question the studio that releases a movie like this . \\nthe producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film . \\nsome have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie . \\namerican pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park . \\nit is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny . \\namerican pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night . \\njim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead . \\njim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' . \\nof course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner . \\nthere are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief . \\namerican pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it . \\ni loved the young cast in this movie . \\nconsider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances . \\nbiggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise . \\nbut in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father . \\nscenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie . \\nafter levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age . \\nbut i never used baked goods . ' \\nit is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out . \\nthere are some less-than-original aspects of the film . \\na bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before . \\nif weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect . \\nsecondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing . \\nbut at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . ' \\nand so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature . \\nin it's own way . \\n\",\n"," b'the calendar year has not even reached its midway point , but that hasn\\'t prevented columbia pictures from trotting out a lavish period drama more befitting of the winter oscar-bait season . \\nbille august\\'s high-profile adaptation of victor hugo\\'s classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep . \\nfor those not familiar with hugo\\'s original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive . \\nafter serving 19 years in a prison work camp for stealing a loaf of bread , the brutish jean valjean ( liam neeson ) is paroled . \\nimmediately upon release , he steals valuable silverware from a kindly bishop who takes him in for a night ; he is caught by authorities , only to be forgiven by the bishop , who lets valjean keep the silver to start a new life on the straight and narrow . \\nthat he does , and in doing so breaks his parole , which sets the obsessively determined inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) , who was one of the guards in valjean\\'s prison camp , on his trail . \\nthematically , however , les miserables is a story about redemption , which valjean finds through his dealings with two women , the hard-luck factory-worker-turned-prostitute fantine ( uma thurman ) , and her illegitimate daughter , cosette . \\nyears after breaking parole , valjean becomes mayor of the town of vigau , where he forms a warm friendship with fantine after saving her from an unjust arrest by javert . \\nvaljean promises the gravely ill fantine he will rescue the young cosette ( mimi newman ) from her cruel caretakers , the thenardiers , and raise the child as his own . \\nthe \" father \" and \" daughter \" eventually land in paris , where the teenage cosette ( claire danes ) falls for dashing student revolutionary marius ( hans matheson ) . \\nthe decades-spanning story is the stuff that cinematic epics are made of , and the danish august turns in his most accomplished english-language work , following the underrated 1994 superstar soap the house of the spirits and last year\\'s stylish but highly preposterous mystery smilla\\'s sense of snow . \\nhe and screenwriter rafael yglesias bring the sprawling tale into clear focus and keep the events moving at a brisk pace . \\nproduction designer anna asp , costume designer gabriella pescucci , and cinematographer jorgen persson give les miserables a sumptuous period look whose accomplishment is mostly matched by the efforts of the cast . \\nneeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush\\'s finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role . \\nthe younger members of the cast fare less well . \\ndanes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard . \\nas technically adept and cerebrally engaging the film is , by the time les miserables was over , my emotions had only been superficially involved . \\nwhile i was touched by valjean\\'s relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved . \\nnot even reaching the \" touching \" level is the cosette-marius pairing . \\nmy only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others\\' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius\\'s who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) . \\nher presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough . \\neven so , as 1998 creeps into summer blockbuster season , les miserables is a thoughtful , well-made , entertaining film , one that will sate moviegoers hungry for a dose of drama before popcorn no-brainers invade the multiplex . \\n',\n"," b'sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw ?

\\nlet me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex . \\nconsider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever . \\ngod takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other . \\nduring the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power . \\n ( parenthetically , witness plato as well . \\nin the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime . \\nnot coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . ) \\ncatholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil . \\nit sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure . \\nmasturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution . \\nthis is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence . \\nas further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters . \\nour culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years . \\nwe can\\'t help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self . \\nmickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves . \\nit is a straightforward liberation through sex . \\nas some good patriarch once observed , \" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . \" \\nm&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions . \\nthey saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions . \\n \" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , \" as mickey says . \\nas a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face . \\nwe are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is . \\n \" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans \" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us . \\nbeyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . . \\nwe have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth . \\nwho else has found it ? --the \\nman of today ? -- \" i \\ndon\\'t know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn\\'t know either the way out or the way in \" --so sighs the man of today . . . . \\nthis is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . \\nthis tolerance and largeur of the heart that \" forgives \" everything because it \" understands \" everything is a sirocco to us . \\nrather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! \\nas far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . \\nits alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . \\nfor example wayne gayle\\'s first report ends with some gen x dude saying , \" if i were a mass murderer i\\'d be mickey and mallory , \" in his most excellent bill and ted voice . \\non one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . \\nit seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he\\'d be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . \\nlet me exemplify what i\\'ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her \" the worst fuckin\\' head i\\'ve ever had in my life ! ! ! \" \\nnow , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn\\'t , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . \\nsometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . \\nit\\'s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . \\nas the attendant approached he took on mickey\\'s character in the eyes of mallory . \\nshe needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . \\nupon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . \\nthe style of the movie is a whole \\'nother matter that i won\\'t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . \\nlet me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . \\nthe rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . \\nalso , jungian archetypes abound . \\nthese can\\'t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . \\nsome of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) : \\nmickey to mallory : \" one of these days i\\'m gonna be cummin\\' for you , \" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off . \\nsemen is a symbol for great potential and things to come . \\nat the time they haven\\'t yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet . \\nthe two of course go hand in hand . \\nfor an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs . \\nmickey during his marriage to mallory : \" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . \" \\nthe way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too . \\nit reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones . \\nthis is what mickey means by \" creator of my universe , \" he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes . \\nit is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears . \\nscagnetti\\'s first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant\\'s mouth . \\nthe indian sage releasing mallory\\'s father , who was reincarnated as a snake : \" old man , go be a snake , \" after telling his \" snake story \" that ends with \" bitch , you knew i was a snake . \" \\nafter mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , \" you killed life ! ! ! \" \\nthis is another telling quote because it implies they didn\\'t see themselves as killers of life . \\nthen what were they killing up to that time ? \\nin some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were . \\nin other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents . \\nthe butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison . \\nit of course symbolizes rebirth . \\ndr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : \" mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just don\\'t give a damn . \" \\nthis is reminiscent of nietzsche\\'s whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil . \\nmickey : \" the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . \" \\nmickey ( again in his interview ) : \" me and you , we are not the same species . \" \\nnotice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control . \\nmickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang . \\nthe wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is . \\nmickey : how ya feelin\\' ? \\nwayne : fucking great ! \\nmickey : you got the feelin\\' ? \\nwayne : i\\'m alive . \\ni\\'m alive for the first fuckin\\' time ! \\nwhat an incredible transformation this is . \\nhe got the feeling and he couldn\\'t contain himself . \\nwhat a feeling . \\nthat feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe . \\nmickey when almost caught in a dead end , \" think , think , think , think . \" \\ngo figure it out . \\ndwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film . \\nhis whole attitude can be summed up with , \" destroy them ! ! ! \" \\n',\n"," b\"to watch `battlefield earth' is to wallow in misery . \\nit is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history . \\nit has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible . \\nworse , there's the promise of a sequel . \\nwhy ? ! \\nsave your money . \\nsome films go quickly to video . \\nthis one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel's `mystery science theatre .

' \\ntravolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth . \\nmuch of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl's petty machinations . \\nhe routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter . \\nbut one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth . \\nwhen the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan . \\nhe will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site . \\nit's not clear how this benefits terl , except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it . \\nthe scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave group's leader . \\na psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how . \\nbut the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language , the principles of our founding fathers , euclidean geometry , and the location of fort knox . \\nthis enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining assignment . \\nit also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors . \\n`we're going to blow up their home world , ' he says . \\n`but first , we need a few more supplies . ' \\nin days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts . \\nby now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl . \\nthe media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta's labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel . \\nnumerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning . \\nand after watching this movie , you'll wholeheartedly agree . \\nthis is a terrible film that is illogically constructed , tediously acted , and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ? \\nat a price tag of $90 million , this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly , assuredly becoming `the avengers' of this summer . \\nboth films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity . \\nin addition to the universally pejorative reviews , there's another bizarre element to the `battlefield' saga . \\nthis film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta , who for over a decade , had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen . \\nthe controversy is that travolta is a scientologist , and `battlefield' is based on a 1982 novel by l . ron hubbard , the religion's late founder . \\nthis led some to believe that `battlefield earth' would amount to scientologist dogma , laden with subliminal messages . \\nbut the story is so poorly told that any message , subliminal or otherwise , is totally undetectable . \\nif the audience got anything out of this film , it was this : we are not too unlike the psychlo leader . \\nlike terl , the audience felt imprisoned , dreaded their situation , and looked for any opportunity to leave . \\ncould that be the scientology message ? \\n\",\n"," b'these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows . \\nmost of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past . \\nbut , some five or six years ago , there weren\\'t that many movies and the trend didn\\'t look that depressing . \\nso , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about \" modern stone age \" family , weren\\'t particularly worried when the word came about live action remake . \\nafter all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good . \\nthe plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age \" town \" of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america . \\nfred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o\\'donnell ) to adopt a baby . \\nto return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management . \\nbut , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme . \\nin the meantime , fred\\'s wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can\\'t stand fred . \\non the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life . \\ncomputer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show . \\nunfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o\\'donnell . \\nbut the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot . \\nsome thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film . \\nresult is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as \" high concept \" . \\nafter great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version . \\nall in all , film isn\\'t that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it . \\n',\n"," b'the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission . \\nhe attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth , but misses . \\nafter they ricochet off his face , he says , \" not a good start . \" \\nas it turns out , this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence , but to the rest of the movie as well . \\nin this , the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong , chan plays an international operative codenamed \" condor \" , and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi\\'s during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war . \\nfor some reason , condor is given his mission at the u . s . embassy in spain . \\ni think this may have been done so that in a chase scene , they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart . \\nwatch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country , most notably in europe . \\nthe chase will take itself through a marketplace , and a fruit cart will be overturned . \\nit\\'s almost a guarantee . \\nanyway . . . . \\ncondor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden ; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly . \\nto help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly , condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( carol cheng ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( eva cobo ) . \\nthere aren\\'t supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain , but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something . \\nalthough these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts . \\nin fact , most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight . \\ni suppose this isn\\'t so bad , since chan\\'s action is really the best part of the movie , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway . \\nif you\\'ve never seen a jackie chan movie , don\\'t expect a great plot , but do expect to be entertained by his moves . \\nthey are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human . \\nknowing that he does his own stunts , and knowing that this is the real stuff ( no computer-masked bungee cords here ) makes the action sequences all the more exciting . \\nyou\\'ve got to hand it to a guy who\\'s probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art . \\nalso of note in this , as in any jackie chan movie , is the humor . \\nas far as i know , none of his films take themselves too seriously , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them . \\nwhat is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes . \\nunlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme , where the fights get you on the visceral level , fight scenes in chan\\'s movies are simply entertaining . \\nyou marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh . \\nunfortunately , even chan\\'s mastery can\\'t save this film . \\nthe plot and characters are so weak that they don\\'t hold the movie together at all , and the acting is terrible . \\ncarol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past , but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off . \\nthis , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying . \\n',\n"," b\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nat the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere . \\nthis highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture . \\nand with good reason . \\nthis is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit . \\nremarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin . \\n ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . ) \\numa thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage . \\nunfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship . \\nat this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days . \\nthe duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot . \\nwhen not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent . \\nif nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt . \\nthe story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption . \\n ( they also sip a lot of tea . ) \\noverlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds . \\nthe avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling . \\nmr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest . \\nat least it all looks good . \\nthis is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt . \\nin particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain . \\nthere are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates . \\nby the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre . \\nnot coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year . \\nit's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining . \\na crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies . \\nthere may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not . \\n\",\n"," b'the film may be called mercury rising , but that title doesn\\'t describe the trajectory taken by this motion picture , a routine thriller that combines government cover-ups with a cloying and poorly-motivated buddy story . \\nthe \" hook \" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic . \\nhowever , aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance , this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device . \\nthose expecting to see even a semi-thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed . \\nmercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism . \\nthe script for mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome and hard- to-swallow . \\ni don\\'t know whether the problem is in the original book , simple simon , or in the screenplay adaptation , but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible . \\nonce again , certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled , and not to good effect . \\nwhile bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood , this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense . \\nthe story begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , art jeffries ( bruce willis ) , is confronted with his own failure . \\nunable to resolve a hostage crisis in time , he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot to death . \\nthe event weighs heavily on his conscience and heavy-handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9-year old simon lynch ( miko hughes ) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player . \\nsoon , art and simon are on the run from seemingly everyone -- fleeing for their lives and bonding at the same time , with the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player always just a step behind them . \\nalong the way , they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy ( chi mcbride ) and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest ( kim dickens ) . \\nwhy is simon in danger and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex-football player ? \\napparently , the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra-secret code called \" mercury . \" \\nto make sure it can\\'t be cracked , they do the most intuitive thing possible : place a sample of it in a \" nerds\\' puzzle magazine . \" \\nof course , no one can solve it -- no one except autistic simon , that is . \\nwhen he calls the phone number listed in the solution , he gets the nsa . \\nas a result , the cold-hearted , sneering government man ( alec baldwin ) decides that simon has to be eliminated -- for the good of the country , of course . \\nbut he hasn\\'t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold , even though everyone in the audience has . \\nit\\'s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn\\'t do anything exceptionally well , and does quite a few things rather poorly . \\nfor those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren\\'t that pulse-pounding . \\nthe climactic struggle is a real ho-hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness . \\noverall , director harold becker is constantly struggling ( and failing ) to generate even a moment that isn\\'t derivative or obligatory . \\nbruce willis\\' star seems to be fading . \\nthis is his fourth straight lackluster outing , following last man standing , the fifth element , and the jackal . \\nwillis isn\\'t terrible , but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through , and often does . \\nalec baldwin , combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross and malice , does some scenery- chewing , but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace . \\nthe film\\'s real star is young miko hughes ( heather langenkamp\\'s son in wes craven\\'s new nightmare ) , who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual , but is about 50 years younger . \\nmercury rising joins the likes of hard rain , the replacement killers , and u . s . marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers . \\nfor those who like action and adventure in the theater , this has not been a good year . \\nhopefully , the advent of summer will change that . \\nuntil then , the best choices ( for bruce willis or any other action hero ) are on video . \\nand , if you\\'re determined to see mercury rising , check out the morning sky in early may . \\n',\n"," b'richard gere can be a commanding actor , but he\\'s not always in great films . \\neverything comes together here . \\ngere is a

and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . \\nbeing the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . \\nperhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . \\nall of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . \\napollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . \\njim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . \\nsuspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . \\nif they ever reach it . \\ned harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . \\naudiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . \\nalso , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . \\nthe special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner . \\nwatch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . \\na bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . \\nthose who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . \\nthis is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . \\nyou should enjoy it . \\n\",\n"," b\"capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made . \\nchristopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . . \\nand nobody wins . \\nthe hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it . \\ni could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren't also insanely xenophobic and insulting . \\nchristopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan . \\nhe meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) . \\napparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered . \\nsince lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die . \\nlet's stop and think about this for a second . \\nif lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock . \\nin this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him . \\ni imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body . \\nyou know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is . \\nthis is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems . \\nlambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun . \\nthey are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows . \\nthe script doesn't know what the hell to do with them . \\nlone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional . \\nthe only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him . \\nin the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype . \\nwhat's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful . \\nalso , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it's been designed to accompany . \\nthere is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie's relentlessly stupid plot . \\nby the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care . \\nwe're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies ! \\nsomeone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way . \\nthis movie bungles two out of three , badly . \\n\",\n"," b'warren beatty , diane keaton , goldie hawn and gary shandling star as a pair of married couples whose

good enough to make us forget its length . \\nthe mile in question ( green due to its faded lime-colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to \" old sparky , \" the electric chair where executions

michael clarke duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls . \\nimmediately , paul senses something different about this prisoner . \\nperhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark . \\nor perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he \" takes back \" paul\\'s bladder infection thereby restoring him to health . \\nbased on steven king\\'s 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner \" fry \" up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for

a return to his roots in ireland , but unfortunately , it is not a successful homecoming . \\ntold through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy , francis ( newcomer eomann owens ) , this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life . \\nhis father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic , his mother ( fiona shaw ) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals , and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore . \\nfrancis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder . \\nthe premise of , \" the butcher boy , \" is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works . \\nfrancis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him . \\nthis is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well . \\nthe fact that we don\\'t get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay . \\nthe supporting characters are no help , though . \\nrea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter . \\nhe usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout . \\nshaw has a little bit more to work with , since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair , but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her . \\nand singer sinead o\\'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice . \\nthe pacing is all off in , \" the butcher boy . \" \\nalthough the story could have been dynamite , it moves at a deadeningly slow rate , and i found my mind wandering every once in a while . \\nit is also very episodic , because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs . \\nat one point , francis is sent away to a juvenile prison , and an odd , possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself , but nothing comes of it . \\ni\\'d rather think of , \" the butcher boy , \" as a brief diversion for director jordan , rather than a total misfire . \\nhe has already proven to be a strong director , but he lucked out with this latest film . \\nwhat could have been a courageous , unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy , only manages to be an ineffective , uninvolivng bore . \\n',\n"," b\"ahh yes . \\nthe teenage romance . \\nan attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl . \\nand with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity . \\nalong now comes `down to you' . \\nthe folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all . \\nonly `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above . \\nit is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to . \\nthis is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing . \\nin strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) . \\nthey hit it off like a couple can only in the movies . \\nfrom here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story . \\nthe plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . . \\nwell , only happen in the movies . \\nfortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal . \\nfreddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around . \\nzak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue . \\nrounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) . \\neven the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' . \\nmaybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd . \\nas a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely . \\nperhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny . \\nthe jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired . \\nthe characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience . \\neven the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course . \\nthe one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) . \\nwhen this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired . \\nin order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity . \\n`10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing . \\nno such luck with `down to you' . \\nit's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end . \\nand at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . . \\nonly in the movies' . \\n\",\n"," b\"die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect . \\nplace the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film's pathetic screenplay . \\nevery line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor . \\nthe plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land . \\nthe film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut-outs . \\nso much for the script . \\nhow about the action ? \\nwell , let's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator--all standouts for their hair-raising suspense . \\nby contrast , harlin doesn't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam . \\ndie harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute . \\nin fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it's good . \\nyou do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it . \\ndie hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff . \\n\",\n"," b'labelling is sometimes everything . \\nin original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . \\nwalter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . \\nproducers weren\\'t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . \\non the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . \\nto make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . \\ninstead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . \\nthe gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . \\nthat is far away from warriors\\' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . \\non the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . \\ncrowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . \\npolice simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . \\nthe remaining eight , led by cleon\\'s lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . \\nupon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . \\nhowever , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . \\nthe reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . \\nif walter hill\\'s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . \\nthe future was much worse than his vision . \\nthe youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . \\ntheir members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . \\nin their vocabulary , word \" arms \" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . \\nthey even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . \\nmany people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . \\nsome of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . \\ndespite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . \\nthe plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . \\nthe fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn\\'t much bloodshed or gore in the movie . \\nediting is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . \\nthe soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . \\nyet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . \\nbest known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . \\nmichael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot . \\nall in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies . \\n',\n"," b\"some concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning , a live-action version of mr . \\nmagoo being a prime example . \\nthe cartoon figure mr . magoo , the bumbling blind man , can be quite funny , but only in small doses and only within the confines of animated images . \\nif you think naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls , you are right , but there is an even more astonishing selection . \\nfor a director they tapped hong kong's stanley tong , whose resume consists mainly of a handful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan . \\nthe story , such that there is one , is about a large , stolen ruby , which looks a woolworth reject . \\nmr . magoo gets it and , of course , does not realize he has it . \\nmayhem then ensues as the bad and the good guys chase each other with mr . magoo frequently oblivious to the fact that anyone is being chased . \\nlike home alone 3 but without any class , mr . \\nmagoo can only be described as painfully bad . \\nfifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity . \\nthe movie's humor is pathetically lame , and the pacing is way off . \\nwhen one is stuck in a theater for an hour and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture , one looks for some solace . \\nmr . \\nmagoo provides only three such moments . \\nthe movie begins and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character , who exudes his usual charm . \\nthe only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus , the sweet little bulldog . \\nangus demonstrates more genuine emotions and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture . \\nfinally , the ending credits contain outtakes of the movie , which have some of the genuineness and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked . \\nrather than attempt to adapt mr . magoo to a non-cartoon movie , nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the cartoon . \\nhe has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes and the affected voice , and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny . \\nmy wife managed to get some sleep during the movie , but i was not so lucky . \\nhopefully , this picture will force producers to think harder about which subjects have promise and which do not . \\nmr . magoo runs 1 : 37 . \\nit is rated pg for comic violence and would be acceptable for all ages . \\nmy son jeffrey , age 8 , said he thought the movie was good and really funny , but recommends you not choose it if you want an action movie . \\nhe said he liked home alone 3 much more . \\nhis friend maxim , age 9 , said that he thought it was good but very silly and parts did not make sense . \\nhis other friend nickolas , age 8 , said he'd

70\\'s . \\nit worked as an eerie homage without being self-referential or smugly postmodern . \\ngenre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick\\'s the shining and george romero\\'s dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative ( i . e . , a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum ; unspeakable dread ensues ) . \\nin a double-whammy for 2001 , anderson shoots and ( mostly ) scores again with his eclectic riff on time-travel episodes from the twilight zone , appropriately titled happy

proves to be a creative delusion , one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend , ruby ( marisa tomei ) : \" he\\'s a freak , but he sure tells a good story ! \" \\nneurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters ( the junkie , the fetishist , the artist , the frenchman , etc . ) , but isn\\'t quite sure how to handle \" sam deed \" when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm , his elaborately constructed fake identity , his pathological fear of dogs , his ability to speak five different languages , and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time\\'s alternate realities . \\n ( don\\'t ask . ) \\nit\\'s all a bit much to take in . \\nruby\\'s close friend gretchen ( cuz ya can\\'t have a love story without the token friend , though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth ) chalks it up as a sexy role-playing game , but her cautious therapist ( holland taylor ) warns her that co-dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she\\'s in over her head with yet another doomed relationship . \\nwho ya gonna believe ? \\ndespite her winning an academy award , marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence , one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents . \\nher brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear \" cute \" to her adoring fans . \\nbeing loud and flashing a ( disingenuous ) smile does not necessarily equal \" substantial and sexy . \" \\nit takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality . \\nthen there\\'s that damned voice , which strains to be oh-so-adorable . \\nlook , this stuff is purely subjective . \\nsome people feel this way about richard gere , others cannot bear to watch robin williams\\' hyperactive schtick . \\nfor my money , it\\'s m . tomei with a bullet . \\nhappy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys ( or , more appropriately , chris marker\\'s la jetee , especially with those still framed \" memory \" photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout ) . \\nmodern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly , vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan\\'s run . \\nas the stranger in a strange land , d\\'onofrio walks slightly out-of-step , wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment . \\nthis is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion ( though it often falls into the sci-fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition -- we want deeds , not words ! ) \\nat least twenty minutes too long , happy accidents eventually gets around to a race-against-time scenario that puts \" sam deed \" to the ultimate test . \\nno movie can live in ambiguity forever , but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives . \\n ( let\\'s pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened , shall we ? ) \\nthere are also some slow , repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he\\'s crazy . \\nthe premise is strong enough to sustain interest , but it\\'s enough to throw a

but lives on forever in reruns . \\nit also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show\\'s obsessive fans who never fail to dress in \" galaxy quest \" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble . \\njason nesmith ( tim allen ) played \" commander peter quincy taggart \" on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do . \\nthe attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt . \\ndane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character\\'s cheesy trademark line \" by grabthar\\'s hammer , you shall be avenged \" ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans . \\none day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of \" galaxy quest \" followers . \\nthey are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia . \\nthey have mistaken the \" galaxy quest \" episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel . \\nthe next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film\\'s only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) . \\nnesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes . \\nnext thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship . \\nof course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them . \\nbut after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians . \\ni was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked . \\ntaking shots at both the obvious and not-so-obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody . \\nnothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration . \\nthe highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub\\'s fred a . k . a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek . \\nwhile scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell \" i need more power down here captain ! \" , \\nchen\\'s cry for help is more to the tune of \" the core , like , won\\'t take it or something . \" \\nit\\'s a hoot , but it doesn\\'t stop there : weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier-than-thou attitude aren\\'t far behind . \\ngalaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it\\'s not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it is immensely entertaining fluff and

difficulty rather than deciding to kill her . \\nwhen he does decide on the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice . \\nif you were going to hire someone to kill your wife , would your first choice be her lover ? \\nno matter how sleazy he is , i would think there might be a chance that he would turn down the opportunity . \\nwhy would steven plan the murder as a break-in in their apartment ? \\nwhy not just take her out as she was walking to david\\'s loft in a bad neighborhood ? \\nwhile deciding among the numerous summer films , you might do well to skip this one . \\nyou\\'ll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the weather channel . \\n',\n"," b'whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask . \\ni have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series . \\nhowever , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data . \\nsomewhere along the line , the \" star trek \" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction . \\nits production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters . \\ngenerations opens in the late 23rd century , where members of the original enterprise crew , including captain james t . kirk ( william shatner ) , are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name . \\nno sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy . \\namong those rescued from the nexus is long-lived alien dr . soran ( malcolm mcdowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world . \\nseventy-eight years later , soran is still trying to get back to the nexus , and again encounters an enterprise , this one led by captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) . \\nsoran\\'s plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains . \\ni don\\'t think it is an insult to fans of \" star trek \" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a \" trek \" film . \\nit\\'s about a chance to visit with old friends , and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy . \\nbut even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn\\'t happen . \\ndata ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing . \\nin the film\\'s major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year . \\nwhat is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ? \\nhe doesn\\'t get a joke . \\nonce the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data\\'s new emotions , but the point is that he\\'s no longer the data we know . \\nif the rest of the \" next generation \" cast fares any better , it\\'s only because they\\'re on the screen so little that they\\'re simply window dressing . \\nbut then again , this story isn\\'t really about the new crew . \\nit\\'s about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . \\nthe huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away . \\nperhaps because he knows this is his last go-round in the part that made him a legend , shatner looks like he\\'s having the time of his life ; stewart , on the other hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast . \\nstewart\\'s edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount\\'s hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players . \\nby contrast , the prologue which features scotty ( james doohan ) and chekhov ( walter koenig ) is the highlight of the film . \\nthese characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it\\'s a moment of high energy . \\nonly thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that\\'s time this new crew doesn\\'t have . \\nit certainly doesn\\'t help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . \\nit\\'s also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . \\ni wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the \" trek \" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . \\nand what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . \\nthere are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations\\' major flaws . \\nhowever , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts . \\nnot just for the enterprise crew , although you\\'d think by the 24th century space travel wouldn\\'t involve rolling around on the floor during a battle . \\nno , i think the audience might need them more . \\nthis journey is one bumpy ride . \\n',\n"," b'a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted ,

a man who sacrifices animals in his basement . \\nthe charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal . \\nhis new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life . \\nkevin\\'s next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law . \\nalthough kevin\\'s career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well . \\nmary ann is starting to have numerous problems . \\nshe is experiencing severe depression over kevin\\'s long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured . \\nkevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife . \\nhe does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife . \\nnot helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm . \\nmary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home . \\nkevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father . \\nhe also starts to lose control of his case . \\nkevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man . \\nthat man is his boss , mr . milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself . \\nkevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store . \\nbut how do you defeat the devil ? \\nwhy is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ? \\ndo filmmakers really believe that \" normal \" courtroom drama doesn\\'t fit the bill and they have to juice them up ? \\nthe courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn\\'t have been too bad if it weren\\'t keanu reeves trying to pull it off . \\ni give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short . \\ncharlize theron defines the term \" over-the-top \" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in \" 2 days in the valley \" . \\nthe only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ? \\nmaybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him . \\nit\\'s pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom . \\nplease read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest . \\nin 1986 i remember watching a movie called \" wisdom \" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do . \\nwhat i like to call \" guess what , it was all a dream \" scenario . \\nin \" wisdom \" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters \" wake up \" from an apparent and say \" gosh , i\\'m glad that didn\\'t really happen ! \" . \\ni considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with . \\nwell , the same thing happens in \" the devils advocate \" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn\\'t happen . \\ni know it\\'s a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that . \\nof course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one . \\nas i recall , \" wisdom \" was a decent film . \\n \" the devil\\'s advocate \" is not . \\nthe devils advocate \\ndirected by taylor hackford john milton . . .

summer's cutesy , largely laugh-free _doctor_dolittle_ continues with this earnest-to-a-fault dramedy . \\nalthough he is top-billed , here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum , who plays ricky hayman , the programming director at a home shopping network . \\nsales are way down , and ricky's job hangs by a thread until he meets g ( murphy ) , a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperate ricky puts on the air . \\nwhile sales skyrocket and g becomes an overnight sensation , the reinvigorated ricky's greed grows , endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research

if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of the film . \\nthe sluggishly paced _holy_man_ is not only slow and overlong ( 113 minutes ) , but an unfunny bore , and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings ; cleansed of both the attitude _and_ comic sensibility that made him a star ( g is , for the most part , a straight man ) , he is a curiously lifeless presence . \\ngoldblum is actually quite good , but it's hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesn't seem to be much interested , either . \\n\",\n"," b'life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless . \\nit combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie . \\nit\\'s an italian film , but don\\'t let that discourage you . \\nsubtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience . \\nlife is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle . \\nthe year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . \\ntheir romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she\\'s already engaged to another man . \\ncan guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? \\nwhat do you think ? \\nhowever , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy . \\nthe fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp . \\nunable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp . \\nhe pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet . \\nas you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them . \\nas a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny . \\nas a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching . \\nroberto benigni\\'s work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin\\'s , and it is easy to see why . \\nhe is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm-hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero\\'s \" triumph of the underdog \" spirit . \\nlife is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust . \\nhowever , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears . \\nwith life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy . \\nit\\'s quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i\\'ve had at the movies this year . \\n',\n"," b'the first film produced by adam sandler\\'s happy madison production company ( clever title eh ? ) is essentially a one joke movie , much like the movies sandler stars in himself . \\nhowever the difference here is that this one joke just isn\\'t very funny . \\nrob schneider stars as the title character , a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends up becoming a \" man-whore \" to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client\\'s custom made fish tank , which deuce destroyed while staying in his home . \\ndeuce goes on numerous \" dates \" , and each woman he goes out with has a \" humorous \" quirk about herself . \\none has

\\n',\n"," b\"an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . \\nthe groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . \\nmore specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . \\neven twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive . \\nalthough , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . \\nthe rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure . \\nif it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 . \\nand with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing . \\nwell ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film . \\nbut one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary . \\nwith no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens . \\nyou don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint . \\ni will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . \\nbut john , it just wasn't scary . \\ni didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me . \\nactually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films . \\nbut the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me . \\nit's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material . \\ncall me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it . \\ni'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up . \\nwerewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) . \\nboy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy . \\nincluding , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . \\nthe neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse . \\ni know it sounds strange , but it actually works . \\nthe scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie . \\nas i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . \\nwhile they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film . \\nand since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch . \\nactually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way . \\n\",\n"," b'i cried during _babe_ . \\ni admit it . \\nthe special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a \" children\\'s film \" --so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental . \\nsuch , my friend , is the power of cinema . \\nwhen word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations . \\nthey can\\'t possibly drop the ball on this one . \\ncan\\'t miss . \\ncan\\'t possibly miss . \\nthey missed . \\nwhat went wrong ? \\nafter much thought , i supply three general rules . \\n ( 1 ) don\\'t let a television actress-turned-comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i . e . , penny marshall\\'s dreadful \" preacher\\'s wife \" ) . \\nbetty thomas worked wonders with \" the brady bunch movie \" , but the same sitcom-airiness doesn\\'t quite work here . \\nit\\'s as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r&b . \\ntake away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid-80\\'s kirk cameron show . \\n ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast-member has to do ( i . e . , \\n \" con air \" ) . \\nit is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one-line-at-a-time . \\nit\\'s even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don\\'t get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits . \\nnow there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he\\'s in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy . \\nnorm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle . \\nbut there\\'s little humor here . \\nthat rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise-ass guinea pig . \\neven the mouth is ill-synched . \\n ( 3 ) don\\'t let the special effects technicians walk away with the script . \\nthere\\'s a certain timing that\\'s mandatory in comedy . \\nto have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson\\'s creature shop , is a travesty . \\nthis is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren\\'t well-timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have . \\nhere , betty thomas is clearly over her head . \\ni wish i could commend the special effects , but they\\'re merely average . \\ncount the number of times where the animal\\'s mouth is turned away from the camera , or too far to notice , or ill-synched . \\nthis is less a \" babe \" and more of a \" look who\\'s barking \" clone . \\nyou may be wondering , \\'how does eddie murphy fare ? \\' \\nwell , he came back with the exceptional \" nutty professor \" , and i don\\'t doubt he can come back again . \\nhere , he\\'s tied into a straight man and given little to do . \\nthe exceptions are when he fears he\\'s going crazy : a far cry from his smarter-than-you\\'d expect routine that he\\'s more adept at . \\nit\\'s unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago , making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years . \\nafter all this , what\\'s left ? \\nbutt jokes . \\na _lot_ of butt jokes . \\ni guess for kids that may be funny , but i was stone-faced . \\nif there\\'s a lesson the film may be telling us , is that animals have feelings too , and they care way too much for your butt . \\n',\n"," b'plot : a big-time momma\\'s boy can\\'t seem to leave his

doesn\\'t have any goals . \\nthen one day , his mother gets an ex-gangsta boyfriend and suddenly he isn\\'t as welcome anymore in his own house . \\nit isn\\'t long after that , that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well . . . it\\'s \\neither time to grow up or bow down ! \\ncritique : first things first ! \\nthis movie ain\\'t about the \" hood \" at all , it\\'s an

. \\nit\\'s about you , it\\'s about me , it\\'s about your girlfriend , your mother , your problems and your inability to face up to your responsibilities and to , well . . . grow \\nup ! \\nthis is an extremely well-written film , with some of the most developed characters that i\\'ve seen on the screen all year , with superb acting performances to match . \\ngranted , the film does start a little slow ( and go a little long ) , but hang in there , because once you appreciate and get to know all of its characters , you will be glad that you did . \\nthis isn\\'t a kid\\'s movie . \\nthis is about the step that you need to take in order to pass into full \" adulthood \" and some might not appreciate the grander theme behind that step . \\ni certainly did , because i too passed , and am passing , through many of these very same things right now ( yeah , yeah , i still live with my momma ! ! ) and related to a lot of the events that went down in this flick ( oh yeah , and for the record , i\\'m not black but that made absolutely zero difference in this case ) . \\nbut that\\'s not even half the story . \\nyou see , the film is damn funny , too . . . and \\ni mean , damn funny ! \\ni was crackin\\' up at almost every other scene , and they weren\\'t \" set-up jokes \" like your typical comedies either , just day-to-day things that we could all relate to ( like the scene in which ving rhames is \" drinking koolaid \" in the kitchen and his infamously improvised \" african squat f * * k \" scene , which you just gotta see to believe ! ) \\nand there are the performances , too . \\nving rhames , now here\\'s a man who has already established an early lead in the race for best supporting actor at the end of this year . \\ndamn dude , you scared the shit outta me ! \\ntyrese gibson , i have no idea where this guy came from ( an r&b singer and mtv vj , you say . . . hmmmm ? ) , but other than his uncanny resemblance to taye diggs , he nailed this part to the tee . \\nfrom scene one on , i was glued to his performance and sympathized with his character as he molded and shaped himself into the person that he hoped to become one day . \\nand everyone else , too . \\ngibson\\'s girlfriend in the film , taraji henson , made me a backer with her many subtle touches , all of which helped raise her character several levels above the \" typical \" bitchie girlfriend that we\\'ve seen in many of these relationship movies . \\nbut that\\'s the thing that i liked the most about this movie . \\neveryone seemed real , the situations felt authentic , the characters all came across as people like you and me with issues and struggles and hopes and fears . \\ni liked this movie a lot because it was masterfully written , wonderfully acted and genuinely entertaining to watch . \\nand yeah , i even liked the whole homage to boyz \\'n the hood that singleton pulled off in the end ( he called this movie a \" companion piece \" to that film ) . \\na very

foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels ) , sports second-rate effects ( the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen ) , lame jokes ( mayor ebert and his assistant gene

inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . \\nand , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . \\nthe trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it\\'s a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you\\'ve seen the animated series on hbo you\\'ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he\\'s been sent to hell . \\ntodd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . \\nnot only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . \\nevery character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . \\nthe story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . \\nal simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . \\nthe next element in the film is the part when

\" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil\\'s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . \\nso , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol\\' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . \\ntime passes . \\nand now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . \\nthis character is merely a poor man\\'s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . \\nnow the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil\\' vs evil . \\nand evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . \\njohn leguizamo\\'s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film\\'s relief point . \\nall this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners . \\nand then there\\'s martin sheen . \\nwhichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . \\nhis selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . \\nas the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . \\nthis is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . \\ni\\'d never thought i\\'d be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen\\'s career is in better shape . \\nspawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . \\nfor most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . \\nit constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . \\ncontinually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . \\nperhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . \\nthe filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . \\nthe quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . \\nit is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton\\'s batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . \\nbut bruce wayne had human elements to him . \\nhe was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . \\nthe character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he\\'s fatigued about being normal . \\nand as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . \\nnone of this is present in spawn . \\nthe fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner\\'s . \\nas an example of this film\\'s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . \\nadmittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that\\'s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . \\nit is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . \\nbesides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . \\nmovies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . \\nand kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . \\nchildren are not muppets . \\nand spawn unapologetically targets children . \\n',\n"," b'look ! the new version of \" psycho \" came out and the world didn\\'t end ! \\ni guess gus van sant really isn\\'t the bringer of the apocalypse ! \\nunfortunately , though , that \" psycho \" didn\\'t end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it . \\nvan sant\\'s controversial \" re-telling \" of alfred hitchcock\\'s classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere ( even before it premiered . ) \\nwithout benefit of an actual viewing , many have said that the film will , at best , suck . \\nbeing an ( almost ) good critic , i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film , at best , sucked ( and that concludes the use of the word \" suck \" and , hopefully , the thoughts that i am a brain-dead orangutan . ) \\ndirector gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it , shot-for-shot , using the same , exact script ( with a few minor alterations . ) \\nthe inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary , even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time . \\nsuspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original . \\nsadly , that did not occur . \\nit is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin ( from the original \" psycho ) , but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen . \\nin moore\\'s case , the film would have been helped if \" the x- files \" gillian anderson had been cast instead ; especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression ! \\nfrom the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence , moore is scully ! \\nmortensen ( who i liked in \" g . i . \\njane \" ) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy/hick , which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point . \\nsam has a twang and a cowboy hat , but that\\'s about it . \\nmortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory . \\nanne heche , in the janet leigh role , does a few good things in her brief time on screen . \\nat least her marion crane has a little life in her , which can\\'t be said for most of the rest of the cast . \\nthe best work , though , comes from vince vaughn , as the demented mama\\'s boy , norman bates . \\nhe\\'s not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins , but he is effective both in being naughty and nice . \\nthe best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn , where they simply talk . \\nthere is some solid acting there , something that is not carried through the rest of the film . \\nvan sant has made a boring film . \\nall the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 aren\\'t as eye-catching now . \\nwhat passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don\\'t impress or excite . \\nvan sant , in what i assume is a grasp at originality , decided to put some stream-of-consciousness images into a few famous scenes ( was that a lamb in the middle of the road ? ) \\nthese images , included with some questionable editing choices , took away from the scenes themselves and caused , at first , bewilderment and , later , laughter . \\ndefinitely not hitchcock\\'s intention ! \\nat least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann\\'s original famous and terrific score . \\nif a film like \" psycho \" does not frighten , then what\\'s the point . \\naside from norman , the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience . \\nthere are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting . \\nin the end , however , the new \" psycho \" is a noble attempt , but , alas , a dismal failure . \\n',\n"," b\"once upon a time jean-claude van damme was a decent action hero . \\nthe muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability . \\nsome of these excursions were fun . \\nbut now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action . \\nand when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ? \\ni'll explain . \\nknock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong . \\nmarcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe-magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider ) . \\nthey become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business . \\ni'm going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one . \\ni'm not quite sure who gives a crap , but i'll issue a warning anyhow . \\ntommy is really working with the cia . \\nhis boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons . \\nhe even stoops so low to put them into children's toys . \\nif you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off . \\nif you think that this ridiculous set-up couldn't even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea . \\nknock off sucks . \\nit stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares . \\nit amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star . \\nthe plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe . \\ndirector tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame-brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot . \\ni suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work , but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous . \\nthe picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence , speeds are altered consistently , and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired . \\nit all sounds very cool . \\ntrust me , it isn't . \\nas much as it scars me to say this ( har , har ) , van damme is terrible . \\nsure , he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease . \\nhe looks like he's doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan , and his performance is stiff and tired . \\ni hate to say it , but perhaps it's time for mr . van damme to give up his day job . \\nit's really a test of endurance watching knock off . \\ni suppose there's some enjoyment derived from schneider's character , who is extremely annoying , but provides the film's better moments . \\nand what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ? \\nhopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter . \\nknock off doesn't even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film , like a handful of van damme's others . \\nno , this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking . \\nand considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department , that is certainly not saying much . \\nnote to self : avoid universal soldier 2 : the return upon release in august ? 99 . \\n\",\n"," b\"those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables . \\ni don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . \\ni haven't even seen that . \\ngoing into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . \\nwalking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . \\nwriter/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film . \\nliam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence . \\nhe is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior . \\nthe priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself . \\nnine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago . \\nconflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo . \\nvaljean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict . \\njavert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice . \\nalong the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) . \\nles miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture . \\nthe production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular . \\nbasil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) . \\nmany scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening . \\naugusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . \\nhe manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately . \\ni was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) . \\nthis film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested . \\nliam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective . \\nthurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one . \\nrush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . \\ni can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . \\nles miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . \\nmy only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . \\neach scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be . \\nfor the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . \\nit's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . \\nhowever , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked . \\n\",\n"," b'cinematically speaking , gordon parks\\' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \\na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman\\'s \" black private dick that\\'s a sex machine to all the chicks \" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \\nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , \" blaxploitation , \" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \\nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film\\'s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \\nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \\nthis fact also explains why john singleton\\'s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \\nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_\\'s plot doesn\\'t score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \\ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \\nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972\\'s _shaft\\'s_big_score ! _ and 1973\\'s _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \\nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \\nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \\nbut that\\'s easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \\npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson\\'s way toward commanding this film . \\npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \\nhowever , he isn\\'t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples\\' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \\nit\\'s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that\\'s exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \\nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson\\'s impressive star turn doesn\\'t quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \\nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \\ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \\nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft\\'s sidekick rasaan . \\nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \\n ( jackson also has little to \" do \" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn\\'t even have one sex scene . ) \\nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he\\'s not really an action director . \\nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \\nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it\\'s just that there\\'s nothing terribly inventive about them . \\nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they\\'re unsurprising and conventional . \\nbut if there\\'s anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it\\'s make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \\nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes\\' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \\neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \\nstyle doesn\\'t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that\\'s of little consequence . \\nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \\n',\n"," b\"arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one-liners are getting worse . \\nit's hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what's it matter to him ? \\nonce again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser . \\nin this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) . \\nwith the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world ! \\nparts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma . \\nyes , the film is that weak , but it's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film . \\nanyway , this definitely doesn't seem like an arnold movie . \\nit just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing . \\nsure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one-liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going . \\nit's understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources . \\naside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films . \\ni'm sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days . \\nspeaking of action , where was it in this film ? \\nthere was hardly any explosions or fights . \\nthe devil made a few places explode , but arnold wasn't kicking some devil butt . \\nthe ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film . \\ni was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down . \\ni also don't know why the film took so long and cost so much . \\nthere was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget . \\nthe budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom . \\nit's pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie . \\ndo they even read these things anymore ? \\nit sure doesn't seem like it . \\nthankfully gabriel's performance gave some light to this poor film . \\nwhen he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you can't help but feel that he looked like a devil . \\nthe guy is creepy looking anyway ! \\nwhen it's all over , you're just glad it's the end of the movie . \\ndon't bother to see this , if you're expecting a solid action flick , because it's neither solid nor does it have action . \\nit's just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign . \\nsave your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience . \\n\",\n"," b'the summer of 00\\' wasn\\'t a very good one for devout cinephiles . \\nit offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update . \\nnurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o\\' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : \" quality \" films ) compete for audiences . \\nalas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season . \\nit\\'s also indie director neil labute\\'s first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i\\'m sad to report it\\'s a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that\\'s as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute\\'s previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic . \\ni went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it\\'s screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment . \\nare critics so desperate for something unique that they\\'re blind to how derivative the particular brand of \" uniqueness \" betty dolls out is ? \\nfor the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material . \\nbetty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation . \\nit\\'s labute\\'s half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn\\'t even seem to have half that heart in it . \\nnurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) . \\nshe happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities . \\nshe\\'s blocked out her husband\\'s death and thinks she\\'s a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love . \\nbetty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit . \\nthe labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime . \\nthe play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute\\'s persistence in wallowing in the horrid things \" average \" people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are . \\nin the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim \" boys will be boys \" . \\nanother character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby ! \\nwhat was once so powerful about labute\\'s work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic . \\nobviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn\\'t it . \\nhe clearly has little passion for what he\\'s doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn\\'t managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience . \\nnearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue . \\nthey evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that\\'s represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . \\ni think rock is a great comic yet he hasn\\'t been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it\\'s like he\\'s doing the damn chris rock show . \\nsurprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks . \\nthat wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body . \\nit\\'s the best work she\\'s ever done . \\nfreeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it . \\nthe actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty\\'s , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . \\nthat\\'s interesting but the movie doesn\\'t do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle . \\nthe film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie\\'s in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it\\'s parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing . \\nthe film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke . \\nbetty\\'s screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn\\'t make any progress in the film . \\nnurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim\\'s wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim\\'s girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don\\'tcha think . \\nbetty has an interesting theme , though it doesn\\'t even seem aware of this . \\nthe current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . \\nthis is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . \\ninstead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the \\'80s than the \\'00s ) , the film simply uses betty\\'s delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation . \\n',\n"," b'susan granger\\'s review of \" mulholland drive \" ( universal focus ) \\nwhatever david lynch is selling , i\\'m not buying . \\nfrom the writer/director of \" blue velvet \" and \" twin peaks \" comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills . \\ndazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a \\'30s-style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip . \\nthe next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase . \\nher aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet . \\nthe brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust . \\nmeanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there\\'s an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city . \\nthe tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered . \\nelena harring and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses , effectively making the subtle switch . \\nthe same cannot be said for former m . g . m . \\ndancer ann miller who\\'s stiff and self-conscious , speaking - like most lynch players - in staccato tones . \\non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" mulholland drive \" is a frenzied , frustrating 4 . originally designed as an episodic tv pilot , this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substance is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out . \\n',\n"," b'it\\'s difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of \" award-winning \" tv commercials , as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes . \\nthat said , hayes\\'s feature film debut lives up to expectations , coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic . \\nbut occasionally , bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary . \\nthose moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film\\'s two stars , jake gyllenhall as the immuno-deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over-protective , hyper religious , reagan-loving mother . \\ngyllenhall\\'s sweet-natured delivery of jimmy\\'s hilariously na ? ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming-of-age story : jimmy is a bubble boy , a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ -- a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld . \\nhis mom home-schools jimmy , filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti-sexual messages , until he\\'s befriended by chloe ( marley shelton ) , the beautiful girl next door . \\njimmy falls in love with chloe , but is afraid that his love will literally kill him , as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss . \\nbut when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend , jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks-addled cross-country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love . \\nthe offensive bits have little to do with jimmy\\'s rare handicap ( regardless of what the film\\'s protesters would have you believe ) , but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes , including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi . \\nbut even if you find stereotype humor funny , it\\'s hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags . \\nthey even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks . \\nbut a few of the harsh jabs manage to work , especially in the case of kurtz , who very bluntly shows the dark , hypocritical side of the religious right , and a wacky send-up of a cult called \" bright \\'n shiny , \" led by the inimitable fabio . \\nunfortunately , a few giggles can\\'t make bubble boy the riotous , off-the-wall comedy it so desperately wants to be . \\nhonestly , it\\'s a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made , and i\\'m not just saying that because it\\'s so mediocre . \\nhow odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesn\\'t seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many . \\nand now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of real-life bubble boy david philip vetter , maybe disney\\'s wondering the same thing . \\nhope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile . \\n',\n"," b'man , this was one wierd movie . \\nsimilar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn\\'t decide which genre it is . \\nthe first hour is your standard stock aliens clone , which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship . \\nthe last half hour ? \\nthis was when the makers blew the script out the airlock and just decided - \" screw it , let\\'s just kill everybody \" . \\nfrom then on - forget sci-fi . . . this \\nmovie becomes 100% horror . \\nwhat really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way . \\ninstead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore . . . . . yawn . . . . everyone\\'s \\nseen it all before and knows when to expect it . \\nthe one thing that was done well was the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew . \\nthere are skeletons lying around mangled and mashed , but what did this ? \\nthen finally after being painfully restored - the new crew views the video . \\nthe acting isn\\'t too bad at all . . . . . considering what the actors had to work with anyway , as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of . \\nthere was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences though , like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space . \\nthis movie could have been so much better . \\nit had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with . \\nthere was just nothing new here that any of us haven\\'t seen before in aliens or hellraiser . \\n',\n"," b'one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet\\'s \" gloria , \" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre . \\nsuddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in . \\nwhen a movie is over , aren\\'t we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ? \\ni thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn\\'t have been anything to talk about in the first place . \\nto be sure , \" gloria \" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy\\'s family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it . \\nright before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . \\neventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . \\nmeanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn\\'t commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime . \\nwhen he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude . \\ngloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don\\'t they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with . \\nthe previous incarnation of \" gloria \" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can\\'t really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars . \\nthere is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn\\'t completely unbearable to watch . \\ni liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . \\nthese bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers . \\nthroughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , \" who really cares ? \" \\nas gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn\\'t sound realistic at all . \\nin the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone\\'s performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . \\nalthough not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored . \\njean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . \\nall other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria\\'s friend whom she turns to for help . \\nsony , the studio that released \" gloria , \" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don\\'t blame them . \\nthey declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved . \\nalthough how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular \" in dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . \\nalthough stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995\\'s \" casino \" or 1996\\'s \" last dance \" if you don\\'t believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful . \\n',\n"," b' \" the red violin \" is a cold , sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached . \\nit\\'s a movie that seems almost clinical , as it traces the 300-plus-years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title . \\nopening in the 17th century , the story shows how violin-maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son . \\nbut when tragedy strikes , the violin becomes the personification of its maker\\'s grief . \\nfrom there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery . \\nagain , tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph . \\nwe follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao\\'s communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz ( samuel l . jackson ) , who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity . \\nthe violin becomes morritz\\'s obsession , just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it . \\nmorritz , however , is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator\\'s intention . \\n \" the red violin \" could have been a touching , inspirational story , as soaring as a beethoven symphony . \\nhowever director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer . \\nhere is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact . \\ngirard , for some unknown reason , uses mostly master shots , keeping his camera - and thus us - at a distance . \\nwe get no feel for the miracle that is the violin . \\nit\\'s resonance , its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression . \\nnor are any of the performances memorable . \\nit\\'s as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin . \\n \" the red violin \" promises much , but delivers little . \\nit is dull at times , a bit pretentious and a might murky . \\nthe movie\\'s music soars over its story and performers . \\nand that is its only saving grace . \\n',\n"," b'a suave , cool , collected , rich , uptight bad guy = cliche . \\na clumsy criminal oaf to add to the laughs = cliche . \\na bad guy who owns a wild animal = cliche . \\na crooked , chauvinistic law enforcer type = cliche . \\nat an intense moment , our main character tries to get away , but the car has trouble starting = cliche . \\ncomplaining about cliches = cliche . \\nok , ok . \\nso we always hear about cliches . \\nbut if there was ever to be a prime example , the real mccoy is it ! \\nnot one uttered word , not one frame of film , not one character in this whole movie isn\\'t a cut and paste example of everything we\\'ve ever seen . \\nthey might as well use this as a training film : \" how to make a bank robbery film in the 90\\'s \" . \\nkaren mccoy ( kim basinger ) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six-year stay at the state prison . \\nshe wants to make things right and go straight , especially with the fact that she has a six-year old son out there who doesn\\'t even know she\\'s alive . \\naware of mccoy\\'s bank robbing expertise , sniveling bad guy jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) uses the same six-year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past . \\nhe wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier , which , by the way , is somehow due to schmidt . \\nand if she refuses ? \\nwho knows what he\\'ll do to the kid . \\n ( cue sinister laughter ) \\nthis movie is so pathetically pitiful that it\\'s hard to know where to begin . \\nthe aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant . \\ni can\\'t stress enough how every single element , whether it be a character , the dialogue , a plot \" twist \" , etc . , is so damn generic that you\\'ll wonder if * anyone * is working behind the scenes , let alone in front of the camera . \\nbasinger is absolutely vacant . \\nand where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her ? \\nhere\\'s someone that spent their time robbing banks , and now as she heads onto the street , we\\'re supposed to feel sorry for her . \\nas she confronts her son , who doesn\\'t even know who she is , are we supposed to break into tears ? ? \\nespecially when neither basinger nor zach english , who plays the kid , has any depth or emotional-radiance whatsoever . \\ni suppose i should mention val kilmer . \\nyeah , that\\'s right - he\\'s in it ! \\nquite sadly too , seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie and never mention his name . \\nand he got second billing ! \\nto be fair , i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j . t . \\nbarker . \\nunfortunately the script doesn\\'t allow much room for improvement , and when his character is used like bookends ( he never shows up in the middle of the film ! ) , \\nwe have no time to appreciate what he might have brought to this project . \\nthe real mccoy just can\\'t keep it\\'s head above water , and soon , * very * soon , sinks into a cliched mess of movie . \\nthe actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer , and the dialogue , particularly schmidt\\'s trite dialogue , falls like the niagra . \\nthis is definitely one to avoid , folks . \\nthe real mccoy is anything but ! \\n',\n"," b\"so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies . \\nthe first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting' . \\nnow comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill . \\nthe classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house . \\nif they survive the night they get the money . \\nif not well you get the jurisdiction . \\nhaving not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake . \\nbut sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on . \\ngeoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people . \\nhis wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends . \\nsteven dismays at the idea and makes his own list . \\nsomehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party . \\neddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways . \\nwhat he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night . \\nif they can they get the money , if not well they don't . \\nthe house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum . \\nyears before mental patients broke out and killed the dr . there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they . \\neveryone who was in there burned to death . \\nnow it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people . \\nwhat starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night . \\nthe deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed . \\none-by-one the people start to disappear . \\nconspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all . \\nthe people find rooms , which once held mental patients . \\nrooms which once had people dying . \\nrooms which may still contain these people . \\nnow these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results . \\nsince i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better . \\ni can say however i liked this movie . \\ngeoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role . \\nfamke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times . \\nali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs . \\nchris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines . \\npeter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims . \\nthe plot was well conceived and was very absorbing . \\nthe movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary . \\ni found even the opening credits to me a little ominous . \\none thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore . \\neven though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell . \\nthe movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with . \\nthe ending is quite clever and some may not even get it . \\ni must say house on haunted hill was a surprise . \\ni was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending . \\ninstead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting . \\nhouse on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously . \\nthough it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws . \\nbut besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time ! \\n\",\n"," b'i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . \\nthe problem is , i can\\'t remember them as i write this review . \\nthat\\'s not a good sign . \\nin booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can\\'t really describe , because i don\\'t know that much about him . \\ni only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn\\'t like relationships , just \" booty calls \" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) . \\nbunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz\\'s direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) . \\nrushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it\\'s going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki\\'s friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met . \\nto make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki\\'s obsession with safe sex . \\nfirst she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them . \\noh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin . \\nback to the store . \\nnow they\\'ve got to get dental dams , or there\\'ll be no foreplay . \\nwhy are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? \\nnikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she\\'d better be making these demands , too . \\ntalk about coitus interruptus . \\nbooty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies . \\nthe difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . \\nin this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! \\nat the extreme . \\nthere are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . \\nit is disappointing , and even worse , distracting . \\nthere are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) \\ndoes not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing . \\nfor instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . \\nbunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone\\'s surprise . \\nhowever , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery . \\nthis negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene . \\nif , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , \" kung-fu movies , \" and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective . \\nthis is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable . \\nby explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . \\nthe inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . \\nwhy are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? \\nwhy do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? \\nif nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn\\'t she have some condoms at her own apartment ? \\nthese questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . \\na very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . \\nsome movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character\\'s pattern of speech . \\nother films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves . \\nbooty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn\\'t work . \\nthey stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them . \\nhalf of the scenes seem to occur for no reason . \\nthe chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler . \\nthis is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long . \\nit\\'s too bad that the core of the film isn\\'t much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog . \\ni refer you to the first paragraph of this review . \\n',\n"," b'annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) , a

that makes you wonder where you\\'ve seen this story before . \\nit\\'s a collection of every cliche and stereotype of the south ever made , and coming from a yankee like me who dislikes the south that\\'s really saying something . \\nfor an established , talented director sam raimi is unable to provide any kind of originality to this film . \\nit\\'s predictable from the first scene , the screenplay is written like a rip-off of a photocopied bootlegged play . \\nyou know that as nasty as the murder suspect is he didn\\'t actually do it . \\nit\\'s no surprise either who the real villain turns out to be and what their motive was . \\nsigh , how trite . \\nfor a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense because it\\'s so cliche . \\n \" the gift \" is basically a glorified b-movie . \\n',\n"," b'it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a . i . \\nartificial intelligence , just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material . \\nfor here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home , an outcast seeking family , themes very familiar from most of spielberg\\'s body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e . t . \\nto empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan , naming just a few examples . \\na . i . is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies . \\nit is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances . \\nthe last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children . \\nand professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution . \\na robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) , who is programmed to love . \\nas a test , david is placed

follows david\\'s search for the blue fairy , whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish . \\nduring these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe ( jude law ) , a robot who specializes in sex . \\nspielberg is at his top form in this sequence , offering a brutal \" flesh fair \" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers . \\nhere , is where kubrick\\'s influence is strongly felt , as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots . \\nthe savagery conjures up images from the late director\\'s a clockwork orange . \\nat about two hours and 30 minutes , the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes , a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters . \\nit is all very anti-climatic and jarring . \\nthese scenes seem almost superfluous , as if from a different film . \\na . i . is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg-13 rating . \\nit is a story combining hope and intolerance , sacrifice and bigotry , and while it does not coalesce perfectly , the movie does offer some disturbing images . \\nbut a . i . \\nis really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment . \\nif ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination , it is this lad , who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david , a being created for the express purpose of loving . \\nhe shines when with monica , beaming with love , as eager as a puppy to please . \\nafter being left in the woods , he is confused , lost , hurt , focusing on one objective : to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother\\'s eyes . \\nlaw is pleasant as the care-free robot who really doesn\\'t understand david\\'s quest , but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey . \\nprobably the toughest role is o\\'connor\\'s monica . \\nplaying an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin , she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance , but as a threat to her family . \\nshe gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot

his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble . \\nand there are several other episodes , each one trumping the next in outrageousness . \\nthe more our well-meaning beau screwed up , the more the audience groaned in sympathy . \\nwe liked greg . \\nand , we liked this movie . \\n \" meet the parents \" is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments . \\njust sit back and watch greg get into trouble . \\nno matter what the situation , whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house , things will horribly go wrong . \\nwe laugh at greg\\'s expense , but love often makes a person do dumb things , and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool . \\ndeniro is also affable , tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside . \\ntheir tug-of-war is often funny , the slapstick is elaborate , and there are several topical throwaway gags ( mostly targeted at the airline industry ) to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in-laws from hell . \\n',\n"," b'with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like \" rock and roll ! \" \\n ( actually , it\\'s \" lock and load \" ) , you can\\'t help thinking tarantino . \\nand of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers . \\nbut if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon . \\n \" inspired by true events \" -- we\\'ve heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated . . . \\nor so strangely poignant . \\nfor this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged . \\nbeginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker . \\nthey fall in love and marry , but pam\\'s increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris . \\nwhen chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up . \\nthen , chris begins to rob banks . . . \\nluke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer . \\nmoustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband . \\n ( it\\'s another of john mcnaughton\\'s coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory ) . \\nbut it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person . \\nif the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it\\'s in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia . \\nas in those movies , there\\'s the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece . \\njudd doesn\\'t entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam\\'s \\'craziness\\' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more \\'normal\\' chris . \\nwhen pam reacts to her father-in-law\\'s death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris\\' face is the picture of pained restraint . \\nof course , it\\'s the question of what is \\'normal\\' that is asked in normal life . \\nmcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity . \\nit is the rational chris that loves guns ( \" shooting is about precision , control \" ) and the \\'crazy\\' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- \" chaos and you and me . . . \\nwe\\'re a real family \" , she notes wryly ) . \\nit is chris\\' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well-planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness ) . \\nin the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : \" buy-more \" -- the perfectly respectable consumption-crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations . \\nit\\'s not a perfect film . \\nsome of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? ) . \\nthe use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam\\'s crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film . \\nindeed , as in mcnaughton\\'s seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths . \\nmcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly \\'realistic\\' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer . \\nthe suburbs , with their miles of white-fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness . \\nin its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick\\'s badlands . \\nwhile pam shares the yearnings of malick\\'s heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a \\'normal life\\' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies . \\nbut these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the \\'normal\\' , conventional world . \\npam\\'s final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement . \\nthe flying inkpot\\'s rating system : * wait for the video . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection .

\\nhowever , it was an even better premise for a drama . \\nthe truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man . \\nthat man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) . \\ntruman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way . \\nchristof is the \" god \" of this made-up world . \\nhe keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles . \\nthere were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal . \\nthe opening parts of the film introduce to truman\\'s world . \\nwe see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past . \\nit may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start . \\nthe film can be described in one word : weird . \\nit seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did . \\nit seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew\\'s idea and he did wonders with it . \\njim carrey actually lived up to the hype . \\nthe hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey\\'s ability to do drama . \\nno one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey . \\nand he showed them all up . \\njim carrey was snubbed at the oscars . \\ni do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination . \\nhe plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world . \\nhe has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening . \\nhe ventures into the wrong elevator . \\na light crashes in front of him . \\nhis father comes back and is then pulled away . \\nwe are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not . \\nand it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish . \\ncarrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama . \\nlaura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife . \\nshe plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point . \\npeter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman\\'s escape . \\nthe story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down . \\ndespite carrey\\'s greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the \" god \" of truman\\'s world . \\nhe displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created . \\nhe becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life . \\nthe action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish . \\nbut , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show . \\nit really makes you think . \\nmaybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show . \\nsome of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking . \\nor when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman\\'s arrival . \\nand when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line . \\nall of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative . \\ni was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it . \\noverall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood . \\njim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best . \\nandrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection . \\nthe truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film . \\n',\n"," b\"michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction . \\nthe most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel . \\nso in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel . \\ncongo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better . \\nit a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good . \\nthe film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l . jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting . \\nseveral years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered . \\nthe plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien . \\nnow that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s . \\nsuddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft . \\nincluded in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) . \\ntogether they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets . \\none major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship . \\nwhat is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances . \\ndirector barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects . \\nthe problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film . \\nit has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen . \\nthe technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting . \\nthat could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film . \\nbut that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster . \\nit requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they don't . \\nhoffman's acting seems muted . \\njackson seems to laid back . \\nwe do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads . \\nlevinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance . \\nand why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess . a \\ncast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price . \\nlook how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors . \\nmost science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects . \\nlevinson tries second-tier effects , and first-tier actors , but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer . \\nperhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium . \\nthe

\\nsectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus . \\nthe virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners . \\nthe water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week\\'s time . \\nresidents are advised to evacuate the area , asap . \\nthis premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas . \\nthe quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that . \\nthe virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background . \\ninstead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities . \\nthe entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible . \\nit\\'s a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background . \\nthe man lives in the apartment directly above the woman\\'s . \\none day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man\\'s living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman\\'s living room . \\nthis hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character\\'s lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways . \\nexample : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole . \\nthe woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up . \\nthis is what passes for meaningful communication . \\nand they say romance is dead . \\nmuch of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are . \\nthere is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people . \\nthey are ciphers . \\ninstead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles . \\n ( this is as fascinating as it sounds . ) \\noffered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i\\'m told , in

the powerful civil war drama , \" glory , \" but since then , he has made continuous disappointments , to me at least , with 1994\\'s \" legends of the fall , \" and 1996\\'s \" courage under fire . \" \\nthose two films weren\\'t bad , just not very good , but with zwick\\'s latest film , \" the siege , \" he has finally made one . \\n \" the siege , \" is a modern-day action-thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city . \\ninvestigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) and frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) , who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it . \\nlater , a bomb goes off in a broadway theater , killing even more . \\nthey soon meet cia operative elise kraft ( annette bening ) , who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist . \\nthere are some movies that simply don\\'t need to be made , and , \" the siege \" may very well be one of them . \\noh , sure , zwick thinks he is making a \" meaningful \" action film , since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism , but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than , say , \" die hard , \" which also starred bruce willis . \\nthis time , willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u . s . army , who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax . \\nwhatever points , \" the siege , \" earnestly tried to make , were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen , or maybe , zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place . \\nthe role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical , just as women were in the recent , \" john caprenter\\'s vampires , \" by placing them all in the category of \" bad guys . \" \\n \" the siege , \" contains three fine actors---washington , bening , and shalhoub---but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development . \\nbening has slightly more to do , and has an intriguing character to work with , while shalhoub pretty much steals the show , even though , again , he has no real character . \\nby the climax of , \" the siege , \" with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so-called \" message \" of the story , i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to , \" on deadly ground , \" in which steven seagal gave a 10-minute speech at the end about preserving the environment . \\n \" the siege \" is constantly heavy-handed , not entertaining or insightful , and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay . \\n',\n"," b'in \" gia \" , angelina jolie plays the titular character , the first so-called supermodel . \\nand right there you have the biggest hurdle this movie had to overcome ( in my eyes , anyway ) . \\ni just don\\'t see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film . \\ndespite this , i kept an open mind when i began watching the movie . \\nsadly , though , my fears were realized . \\nit\\'s just not possible to make an interesting , full-length film about a person who spends their days wearing different clothes . \\nthe movie follows the rise and fall of gia ( no last name ) , a tumultuous woman who doesn\\'t particularly enjoy the world of fashion . \\nshe becomes famous more quickly than she can handle , and finds herself hooked on drugs and on a woman she cannot have . \\nthe last hour of the film is just one scene after another of gia getting high , losing a job , and going into rehab . \\nthis formula is repeated several times , and i really got tired of it . \\nin general , i tend to dislike movies featuring heavy drug use . \\nno because it offends me or anything like that ; it just bores me . \\nquite frankly , i don\\'t see the appeal , so when a director shows me a point-of-view shot of a junkie , complete with tipsy camera angles and echoing voices , i am left somewhat unimpressed . \\nthe first hour of the film , though , was actually quite engaging . \\nwe see gia as she is discovered and moves to new york with her boyfriend . \\nthese early scenes were interesting . \\nwe\\'re shown the fashion world through a newcomers eyes , and it was a perspective i hadn\\'t seen before . \\nthe movie begins to go downhill , however , once gia becomes an established model . \\n>from that point , i lost all interest in the movie and was counting the minutes before it would end . \\nit all seemed so excessive . \\nfine , so gia had a drug problem , does this really need to dominate the film ? \\ncouldn\\'t the same effect have been had with a five or ten minute montage of scenes featuring gia experimenting with drugs ? \\nor perhaps this film is meant to be a warning to aspiring models not to get into the drug world . \\nquite possibly , although since i have no desire to become a model , this warning is lost on me . \\nas i stated at the beginning of this review , i simply don\\'t see how the life of a model is worthy of a feature-length motion picture . \\nwhat do they do that warrants a movie ? \\nstrut their stuff for thousands of dollars an hour ? \\ni suppose the same could be said about making movies about baseball players , for example , but at least somebody like lou gehrig led an interesting life . \\ngia did not . \\nand by the end of the film , all i knew about gia for sure was that she hated modelling , was bi-sexual , and was heavily into drugs . \\nnot exactly a meaningful contribution to society , as far as i\\'m concerned . \\n',\n"," b'if you\\'ve been following william fichtner\\'s career ( and there\\'s absolutely no reason why you should have ) , you might have noticed that he\\'s played some rather similar roles over the years . \\nlike sully in \" the perfect storm \" --tough , gruff , and a little bit scary . \\nor law in \" albino alligator \" --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier . \\nor colonel william sharp in \" armageddon , \" or dwayne engelman in \" strange days , \" or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of \" pearl harbor , \" as the abusive father of

. \\nin the film , fichtner plays a blonde haired , meticulously dressed , overtly effeminate , dog-loving detective . \\nas alex tardio , fichtner\\'s performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it . \\nit borders on offensive but doesn\\'t really manage it . \\nand it borders on clich ? d stereotype but doesn\\'t quite succumb to that definition either . \\nin a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming , fichtner isn\\'t perfect--you can see him struggling a little at times , concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air , or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal--but he\\'s pretty damned good , and silly , and without question the best thing in the film . \\nin fact , had it not been for fitchner\\'s sudden and bizarre appearance , and his jarring screen presence thereafter , i would have walked out , for \" what\\'s the worst that could happen ? \" \\nis mesmerizing in

out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in \"

attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel . \\nnow stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home . \\nafter all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth . \\n \" mission to mars \" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let\\'s start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film . \\nthat\\'s it . \\neverything else fails . \\nthe failure isn\\'t de palma\\'s fault ; he\\'s working from an atrocious script . \\nonly during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in \" 2001 \" ) where the rescue team\\'s air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does \" mission to mars \" come to life . \\na scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger/more danger/attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it\\'s just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes . \\ntake it out , and the plot isn\\'t affected in any way . \\nthe sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship\\'s computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , \" 2001 \" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ? \\nwhy did tim robbins\\' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? \\nshouldn\\'t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? \\nwhy are the characters such idiots ? \\nbecause the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . \\nall the \" conflict \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : \" jim , it\\'s too bad you can\\'t go on this mission because you were determined \\'psychologically inadequate\\' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together \" -- does anyone really talk like this ? \\ncan\\'t we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? \\nthe whole film is like that . \\nthe filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what\\'s going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we\\'re looking at * every * time . \\nsample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : \" look , there\\'s mars \" astronaut b : \" you sure that\\'s mars ? \" \\nastronaut a : \" yeah , that\\'s mars all right . \" \\nastronaut c : \" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? \" \\nthat exchange isn\\'t actually in \" mission to mars , \" but i wouldn\\'t be surprised if it were . \\nfor all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven\\'t learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don\\'t tell . \\nde palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . \\nthis is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won\\'t get what\\'s going on , so they explain everything five times over . \\nfourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . \\nthe principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i\\'m just here to get a paycheck \" attitude . \\ncheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . \\narmin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . \\nrobbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . \\nand sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . \\nand of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . \\nit could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going . \\nleisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . \\nsupposedly we\\'re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . \\nme , i alternated between the two . \\nthere is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars \" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over . \\n',\n"," b'this has been an extraordinary

not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i : the phantom menace , because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy . \\nand no , i really don't feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box-office . \\nreally , i don't . \\nnot at all . \\nthe plot has been done before -- a mysterious , unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town , causing confusion for everyone who reads it . \\nthe center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen ( kate capshaw , and by the way , what is it with bookstore owner main characters ? \\nin the past year and a half we've seen them in life is beautiful , you've got mail , this movie , and the upcoming notting hill ) , who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore . \\nshe immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from , and comes to the ( incorrect ) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott . \\nhe , reading the letter himself , assumes that she wrote it for him . \\nafter a while , they fall in love ( well , duh ) . \\nkate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her , and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman ( tom selleck ) . \\nto add to her turmoil , her mother shows up ( blythe danner , who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 ) and her trusted bookstore manager ( deadpan ellen degeneres ) quits . \\nsupporting characters aren't called supporting for nothing . \\ntheir purpose isn't just to move the plot along , they're also supposed to give the storyline a backbone . \\nto do this , they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting . \\nrarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed , dull , cardboard secondary characters , especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist's various interactions with them . \\nthis is the love letter's damning error . \\ncapshaw's character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies , but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one-dimensional . \\nbecause of that , the love letter is awkward and insincere . \\neven worse -- it's a bore . \\ni liked capshaw and her helen , but everyone else is painfully fake , undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist . \\nthere is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either -- and besides degeneres' wisecracks , there's little that is even a little amusing . \\nthis is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter ho-sun chan does a good job of portraying helen's yearnings and various subtle complexities . \\nbut it's far from profound . \\nthere isn't a common theme running through the proceedings , thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless . \\nreally , this is a harmless little movie ; it's far from an abomination and it's not torturous to sit through . \\nbut bad , it is . \\nawful , it also is . \\nthe love letter is a failure , and an inane failure at that . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n\",\n"," b'capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . \\nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver\\'s travels and treat it as an action film . \\nthat makes it a film without much center . \\n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \\npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \\nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver\\'s travels . \\nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift\\'s island of the houyhnhnms . \\nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \\nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \\nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \\nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \\nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \\ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \\nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \\nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \\nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \\njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \\nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \\nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \\npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith\\'s best if not his best . \\nwhen the film\\'s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \\nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \\nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \\nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \\nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton\\'s new version is even less faithful . \\nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \\nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \\nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \\nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \\nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world\\'s most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \\nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \\n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \\nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \\nand the language they talk is earth- english . \\napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \\nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn\\'t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \\nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \\nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \\noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \\nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \\nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \\nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \\nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \\nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \\nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \\nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \\nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \\nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each\\'s place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \\nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \\nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \\nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \\nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \\nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \\nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn\\'t like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \\nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \\nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \\nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \\nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \\nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \\nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \\nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \\ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker\\'s visualization is really an improvement . \\nthese visuals work nicely . \\nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \\napes spring incredible distances . \\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \\nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \\nbut he delivers them very well . \\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \\nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \\nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\\'s performance in spartacus . \\nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \\ndanny elfman\\'s score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith\\'s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic . \\nthat score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten . \\ni rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n"," b'movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable . \\ni originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in \\'95 , but i wanted to re-write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics . \\nwe need to be warned about some truly awful films , too . \\nthis picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) . \\nthe only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno . \\nso , it does indeed have some plusses . . . \\nin fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff . \\nand her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone . \\nthis character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) \\nfar too annoying far too often . \\nlike in 1998s \" bulworth \" , when the movie was over i didn\\'t care one little iota about the main character . \\nat least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though . \\n \" showgirls \" is too stupid to make a statement . \\nsome people claim that the story is based on the legendary \" all about eve \" of all things ! \\nif exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he\\'d be . . . well , \\nhe\\'d be a good screenwriter . \\ninstead , this project may have sunk his career . \\nhe wrote the ( ha ha ! ) \\nscript and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed . \\nthe same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( \" basic instinct \" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones . \\nthe predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer . \\nafter the supposed street-smart young \" lady \" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the \" stardust hotel \" . \\nnomi doesn\\'t take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away . \\nfirst , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club . \\nshe sells her hot little wares at \" the cheetah \" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience . \\nhey , i never said she wasn\\'t a hot number . . . \\nmaybe it\\'s that , her body , which gets her into the big-time when the star of the \" stardust hotel \" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn\\'t her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) . \\ncrystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) . \\nhe also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm who runs the big show . \\ncrystal gets nomi onto the \" stardust \" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi \" earns \" the role of crystal\\'s understudy . \\nthe slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal . \\nit was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she\\'s \" not a whore \" . \\nthat\\'s a phrase we hear a few different times and it\\'s completely ludicrous . \\nof course she is ! \\nshe sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we\\'re supposed to believe that she\\'s a better person than that . \\nwe\\'re supposed to root for her . \\nno way ! \\nshe\\'s a tramp and a back-stabber who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax . \\nshe is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is . \\nthe sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more . \\nit sure ain\\'t character development ! \\nplummer also appeared in \" speed \" in \\'94 in a smaller , yet better role . \\nthis sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control . \\nkyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or his standards have dipped since appearing in \" blue velvet \" . \\nthat picture was weird , but some critics claim it\\'s one of the best movies of the \\'80s . \\nnow ol\\' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the \\'90s , too . \\nhis sleazy character is important to \" showgirls \" , but we don\\'t learn anything about him . \\nhe uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie . \\nis he a villain ? \\nwho cares ! \\nultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit . \\neveryone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool . \\nwhat few reviewers take issue with is how mean-spirited this movie is . \\neveryone\\'s either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge . \\nit\\'s just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) . \\nif we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn\\'t verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ? \\nit\\'s hard to care about these people if we can\\'t even appreciate what they\\'re capable of doing on-stage . \\nberkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body . \\nafter all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession . \\nperhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford . \\noops , they\\'re bad actors , too . \\nwell , at least , they\\'re not selfish and contemptable like good ol\\' slutty nomi malone . \\nuseless trivia--ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and \" holier than thou \" jessie on the teeny-bopper tv show , \" saved by the bell \" , before breaking onto the big screen . \\n',\n"," b'at first glance , three kings looks to be just another war movie , the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember . \\nthe 90s version , it definitely is , just another war movie ? \\nnot in your dreams ! \\nimagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan , that\\x12s three kings for you . \\nbelieve it or not , it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter . \\nthe story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war , with the allied troops victorious . \\nmajpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert . \\nas the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home , this `wild bunch\\x12 goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army ) . \\nthey soon find out that they have much resistance , as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddam\\x12s forces . \\nfrequently switching their modes between looters and robin hood\\x12s merry men , they become consciously attacked by their own morals . \\nas the film begins to roll , it seemed to have a rather `light\\x12 mood to it . \\n`special\\x12 effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie . \\nthree kings is much smarter than that . \\nas the conflict becomes more and more complex , the audience will be trapped in a limbo , trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray . \\ni personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity . \\nthis simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant . \\naction sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielberg\\x12s in-your-face war violence . \\nthey are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses , right before the action starts . \\nnot john woo for sure but more of sergio leone\\x12s spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) . \\ngreat performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director . \\nthree kings ranks among the best films of the year , well , for me at least . \\nhighly recommended . \\n',\n"," b'cashing in on the success of white men can\\'t jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles ( including the cowboy way and drop zone ) , wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed , hoping that they can strike up the same success . \\nsadly , if this dismal , cliche ridden and mind-numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by , they haven\\'t got a chance in hell of even coming close . \\nthis time out , the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops . \\nfollowing several run-ins with their tyrannical boss ( robert blake ) , who is obsessed with the \" money train \" --a train which carries all the subway\\'s takings--and will let nothing stop it ( now * there\\'s * an original plot device ) , harrelson\\'s character decides to try and take off with the cash . \\nalong the way , both of them fall in love with the same woman--another transit cop who also hates her boss . \\nthis leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard ( \\'you were always the better brother\\' etc . etc . etc . ) , and doesn\\'t help to add anything to the film . \\ngiven a better script , better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time ( the film almost went for two hours--or did it just feel like it ? ) , this film might ( and i mean * might * ) have turned out okay , but as it is , it is stocked with the worst action film cliches , whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time . \\nrobert blake , who plays the evil boss , has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history ! \\nhe sounds like wayne newton , and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets ! \\nbut this is only one of money train\\'s problems . \\nif you look at the script as if it was an action film , it lacks originality and suspense . \\nbut if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film , it is even worse . \\nthe final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain\\'t butch and sundance . \\nthe film isn\\'t all bad though . \\nsnipes and harrelson , when they aren\\'t using the dumb cliches that the script gives them , make an agreeable duo , and some of the stunt-work is indeed excellent . \\nbut good stunt-work cannot save a bottom-of-the-barrel action movie . \\nif you\\'re a really undemanding action freak , there\\'s a chance you\\'ll like this . \\nbut if you\\'re looking for something original , or suspenseful , try somewhere else--i doubt you\\'ll find it here . \\n',\n"," b\"i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work . \\nhe always finds a clever way to spice

steers out of her way . \\nmirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink . \\nin other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work . \\nthe plot is a big problem here . \\nmaterial that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director . \\nthe likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . \\nbut typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . \\nlater on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam . \\nleigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . \\nalas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . \\nin the morning . . . \\nhow convenient ! \\nthe three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name . \\nthings get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . \\nthe plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . \\nof course , not everything goes entirely to plan . \\nbesides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress . \\nthere is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved . \\nthe humor is completely inconsistent . \\nafter many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze . \\nyou continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . \\na moment like that never arises . \\nwilliamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor . \\nand the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . \\non the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . \\nwhile everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . \\nthere are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script . \\nmirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . \\nshe is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom . \\nif there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' . \\nbasically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here . \\nhis uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . \\nwe will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real . \\n\",\n"," b\"when i was asked to see this movie with a friend , my initial reaction was ? not hugh grant ! ' \\ni was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead . \\nwhat makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script . \\nthis writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ? four weddings and funeral' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between . \\nhugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings' . \\nhe plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck . \\nunfortunately , he is type cast in this role , but fortunately it works well for him in this movie . \\nif only he would dither a little less . \\njulia knows this role well . \\nthe glamorous movie star who is searching for true love . \\nthere are moments in this movie , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness . \\nhow sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful , but to have no one to share it with . \\nthe writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels . \\nhow differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment . \\nhow the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive , and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice . \\n\",\n"," b' \" pokemon 3 : the movie \" has a lot of bad things in it . \\nfirst of all it\\'s a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents , badly written script and fantastic animation . \\nthe first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically . \\na sequel soon followed and even made $45 million . \\nwarner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid . \\nthis time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is \" pokemon : the johto journeys \" so go figure ) anyway he comes in contact with a young girl who\\'s father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown . \\nthey are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities . \\nthe unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly\\'s house and creates every wish she wants . \\nnow it\\'s up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one . \\ntoo bad really that this is a bad movie , surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing , the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between . \\nit has some good qualities ( animation , message in the end ) but the flaws seem to overpower the goods . \\ni\\'m still not sure what the big thing is about pokemon , they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language ( besides meowth , my personal favorite ) and you don\\'t understand what they are saying . \\nmy little brother just thought the movie was amazing , and i kept leaning over and asking him happened , or what pokemon that was . \\nhis response was a big lecture of how this is that , and that is this . . . he \\nsure did put me in my place . \\nwith the second and third movie being bad , i have a feeling pokemon 4 : the movie might be a total bust as well . \\n \" pokemon 3 : the movie \" has some redeeming qualities for the kids , and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film . \\nfor those parents and/or brothers and sisters who have to sit through this . . . bring a pillow . \\n',\n"," b'one of these days , i\\'ll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie . \\nking of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings . \\nit\\'s a perfume-drenched , coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains . \\nferrara\\'s only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he\\'s onscreen . \\nhis 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure . \\nwhen he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there\\'s a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair . \\nyou know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they\\'re actually having fun ? \\nthe addiction is that movie . \\nwalken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout . \\nthe central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island ) . \\nmuch like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni\\'s terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill \" relationship \" with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she\\'s a model . ) \\nmatty\\'s lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara\\'s entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout . \\nno kidding . \\nrequiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara\\'s movies and his controversial urban lifestyle . \\nmatty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him . \\nno doubt , he was off chasing the dragon . \\nin his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full \" dirty ol\\' man \" mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs . \\nwider ! ) \\ntoward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out . \\nsomething happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it\\'s exactly what you think it was . \\nsuffice to say , there\\'s some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all . \\nthe blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea . \\ncinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and we\\'re back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits . \\n \" yeah ! ! ! \\nyeah ! ! ! \\narrrghhh ! \" \\nsays mr . hopper . \\ndirty old sod . ) \\nit\\'s compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny . \\nhow\\'s that for cryptic ? \\nnever fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he\\'s all about . \\ni can picture it now . \\n \" take off yer clothes , kid -- it\\'s essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you\\'re his visual id . \\nyou\\'re the soul , the heart , the bloodstream of the picture . \\ntake it off ! \\ntake it all off ! ! ! \\nha ha ha ! \" \\nfriggin\\' vampire . \\nyeah , you , ferrara . \\na final word about matthew modine : he\\'s actually a fine actor when properly cast , but there\\'s something too squeaky-clean in his demeanor . \\nhe\\'s ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations , such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time-bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene , though no one seems to notice him ) . \\n[he was in that scene ? \\n-ed . ] \\nhere , he\\'s asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs . \\nhe throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it\\'s somehow lacking . \\nmodine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara\\'s flesh fair . \\nbetter luck next time , matt . \\nsomeday , you\\'ll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn\\'t really your fault in the first place . \\nmaybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere , and all will once again be well in your world . \\n',\n"," b'attention moviegoers : you are about to enter a meaning-free zone . \\nshould the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes , do not panic . \\nthe film will work just as well as a silent movie . \\nchronicling the meaningless lives of vain , yuppie types , the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films ( last days of disco , barcelona and metropolitan ) but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing . \\nfirst-time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth . \\nthere isn\\'t one of these characters worth caring about . \\nthe movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of \" people magazine . \" \\namong others , the movie features : ben affleck , casey affleck , david chappelle , janeane garofalo , gaby hoffmann , catherine kellner , courtney love , jay mohr , martha plimpton , christina ricci and paul rudd . \\nand unlike people magazine , the people speak , not that they have anything interesting to say . \\nit\\'s new year\\'s eve in 1981 , and monica ( martha plimpton ) is preparing her big party . \\nstructured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party , director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars . \\nmonica\\'s apartment is in \" noho , \" an area that one of the guests describes as \" so cool , all of the poor people live there . \" \\ntypical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin ( paul rudd ) and his friend and would-be sexual partner lucy ( courtney love ) . \\nthey argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone , except him , of course . \\nshe dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her , which turns out to be neither erotic , funny or successful -- rather like the rest of the story . \\nthe movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new year\\'s eve birthday . \\n \" cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people , \" kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie . \\nanother character , played by jay mohr , has a problem with his sexual triumphs . \\nevery woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning . \\nwhen his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him , his response is \" i like a lot of people . \" \\nas the movie finally draws to a close , the characters awaken from their post-party game of musical beds . \\nsome have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little , while others actually have some clue as to what happened . \\nthe movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot , all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind , which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie . \\n200 cigarettes runs 1 : 40 . \\nit is rated r for profanity , sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers . \\n',\n"," b'they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie\\'s poster : \" no sequel . \" \\nscary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor , and it is not because the wayans brothers , shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera , don\\'t try . \\nwhat defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof . \\nthe first movie - an outrageous , low-brow , savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer - succeeded because of its take-no-prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue , familiar and popular . \\nin scary movie 2 , the filmmakers take on the haunted house-ghost story format which , if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill , did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series . \\nscary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist , featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn . \\nof course split pea soup is the punch line - an overabundant amount , which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive . \\nbut this pre-credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action , which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project . \\nsome of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original , but they lack that take-no-prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque . \\nscary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another , offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball , and the films what lies beneath and hannibal ( features that only faired adequately at the box office ) , john woo\\'s mission : impossible 2 and charlie\\'s angels . \\nit is as if the wayans and their team of writers - at least seven are credited - just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they\\'d coalesce . \\nthey don\\'t . \\nwhile the pace of the original left you breathless , the sequel moves with the speed of an 18-wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road . \\nyou can almost hear the reels panting . \\nscary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original , but it falls very short . \\nit\\'s a dissatisfying spectacle , a very weak sister of a very good movie . \\nthe really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is . \\n',\n"," b'there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . \\nwhen i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . \\nyou see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . \\ni hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . \\ni hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac\\'s shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . \\nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying . \\nit\\'s confounding . \\ni can\\'t believe a film can be this bad . \\nand yet , it\\'s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . \\nin the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . \\nin the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn\\'t want to kill himself . \\nwhile there , he notices that the doctors don\\'t care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . \\nso , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . \\nhe goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it\\'s good to help people . \\nhe also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . \\nnaturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . \\nso patch decides that he\\'s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . \\nand that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . \\non a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn\\'t say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter\\'s performance , even if she is wasted ) . \\nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution . \\nevery scene swells with grand , \" emotional \" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . \\ntake , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . \\nwe don\\'t know patch yet , but there\\'s sad music , and it\\'s supposed to make us really sad that he\\'s sad . \\nlater on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . \\nand when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . \\nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . \\nreal drama is character-based . \\nyou grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . \\nwe don\\'t ever grow to know the dying patient ; he\\'s simply a vehicle for patch\\'s greatness . \\nreal drama doesn\\'t seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . \\nthat\\'s why patch adams is not real drama . \\nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . \\neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman\\'s sickening musical score . \\nsentimentality like this is indeed bad . \\nbut it\\'s not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . \\nyou see , patch is a really great student . \\nhe aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he\\'s cheating . \\nbut patch doesn\\'t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . \\n \" why don\\'t we see patients until the third year ? \" he bursts out every three seconds . \\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \\nmost of us have to study . \\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\\'t be too successful in preventing death . \\noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" \\nyes ! \\nthat is true ! \\nand you can not do that without studying . \\nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \\nfollow the rules ? \\nbah ! \\nwho needs the rules ! \\nonly uptight doctors follow the rules . \\nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . \\nand then there\\'s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . \\na free clinic . \\nin the middle of the forest . \\nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . \\nfor free . \\nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ? \\nwill it have an emergency room ? \\nor is it just for mental patients ? \\nand who , may i ask , will pay for it ? \\nthe film does give some token attempts to question patch\\'s motives ( i think another character asks him how he\\'s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don\\'t explore or challenge patch\\'s ideas to any meaningful extent . \\nreader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . \\ni know nothing about him . \\nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . \\nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . \\nand in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . \\nactually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . \\nhe shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . \\ni won\\'t tell you that you can\\'t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . \\ni was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . \\npatch adams is the cheapest of them all . \\n',\n"," b\"bruce lee was a bigger-than-life martial artist ( and ) actor . \\nbruce's unique character ( i . e . , self-produced sound effects , etc . ) and seemingly perfected martial art and physique were all well portrayed by the actor , james lee . \\nthe story is told from his wife linda's point of view where she put a lot of family and practical side of bruce lee's life . \\nhowever , you can't help but like , whenever the fight scenes are on , what he can does with his body and that familiar bruce attitude and character . \\ni also like the little bits of insight scenes about bruce lee's life before he became famous : scenes like bruce practicing pronunciation of english . \\nit seemed as if he was no better than anybody else . \\nscenes like bruce delivering chinese food as a delivery boy ridding a bike through the american college looking at the ( all-white ) students , cheerleaders , and athletes . \\nit seemed he too wished for the american dreams and hopes . \\nin conclusion , the movie was well made , it produced a realization of who bruce lee was , and actor james lee was so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor . \\nand the fighting scenes were all excellent . \\nso go see it and enjoy the movie . \\np . s . if you have seen the movie unforgiven by clint eastwood , then the feeling left after dragon was very much like the feeling you got after the unforgiven . \\n\",\n"," b'in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see . \\ni realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike . \\nbut in the case of american beauty , i must make an exception . \\nif you haven\\'t yet seen it , go see it . \\nnow . \\nstop reading this review and head for your local multiplex , then after you\\'ve seen it , come back . \\ni\\'ll wait here . \\nwelcome back . \\nif you followed my advice ( and i see no reason why you should not have , do you ? ) , \\ni\\'m sure you\\'ve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life . \\namerican beauty is an extraordinary film , a powerful , jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream . \\nit\\'s humorous but it isn\\'t funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production . \\nmixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended , and by god , it works , making it one of the year\\'s very best . \\nlester burnham ( kevin spacey ) has entered the mother of all mid-life crises . \\nhe is living life without a purpose . \\nhe is bored , depressed and sick of his sheltered , insignificant existence . \\nhe barely ever talks to his family , has no sex life , is stuck at a dead-end job and thinks he has no reason to live . \\nbut one day , when he and his equally troubled wife ( annette bening ) attend one of his daughter\\'s ( thora birch ) cheerleading performances , he sees something that makes him come alive . \\nwhat he sees is the performance by his daughter\\'s friend , the head cheerleader . \\nhe develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl ; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature . \\nbut for the first time , lester feels that he is actually living . \\nthis crush is only the beginning . \\nlester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life , buying the car of his dreams , cursing off the boss and quitting his job ( \" today i quit my job , told the boss to f * * * himself and blackmailed him for $60 , 000 -- would you pass the asparagus please ? \" ) , \\nbuying drugs from the voyeur-next-door ( ricky fitts , a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be \" beauty \" ) and refusing to be docile in family affairs . \\nhis new attitude further alienates his daughter , only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be , and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor . \\nand the burnhams\\'s neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum . \\nricky fitts ( wes bentley ) serves as the film\\'s thematic center , providing the obscure , powerful meaning of the title . \\ncolonel fitts , the father , is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie , even considering his limited screentime . \\nkevin spacey has never been better , and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel . \\nhe never plays his droll character as a freak , rather , he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self-exploration by his dissatisfaction with life . \\nspacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime . \\nequally astonishing is young thora birch , who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness . \\nat two hours and ten minutes , american beauty didn\\'t feel nearly long enough . \\nit\\'s a complicated , unforgettable film that , like the ice storm two years ago , dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life . \\npowerfully and cynically , it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream . \\nit claims that this picture-perfect image is just that -- an image , and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it . \\nthe dark , deeply ironic ending , though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie , stays with you for weeks after it\\'s all over . \\namerican beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released ; even more so considering it\\'s a masterpiece . \\n',\n"," b\"so many students strive to get into schools such as harvard of princeton , but they just don't get the good grades . \\nso many students would do anything to reach their goal of getting into this schools . \\nlegend has it that if your roommate

these questions were running through my mind while watching this slick suspense film . \\nthe events in the curve are very surprising , original , and fun . \\nthe plot sounds much like dead man on campus , but that is not the deal with this film . \\nthis film is a very serious one , with not many laughs . \\nthere are many twists and turns that make this film different from most films . \\nthe ending in particular is completely unpredictable and satisfying . \\nit is a terrific , suspenseful ending that i could never predict would happen . \\nhands down to dan rosen who wrote this wild ride

fantastic as chris , who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the 4 . 0 . \\nmichael vartan was also superb in never been kissed , where he co-starred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student . \\nkeri russell also gives a great performance . \\nshe should be a good actress in the horror department of the film . \\ntamara craig thomas is also realistic , especially coping with the death of her boyfriend . \\nsome very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles , such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case . \\nthe bottom line- i might just have to curve that a- into an a . \\n * note- the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early 1998 . \\nit was decided the film would not be released widely . \\nit is now available at blockbuster video only , and for rent only . \\nsee you at the video store ! \\n\",\n"," b'seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . \\nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies , it\\'s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word \" routine . \" \\ni\\'ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it\\'s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . \\nit\\'s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another\\'s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . \\nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . \\nwe meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . \\nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . \\nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn\\'t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . \\nit\\'s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . \\ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . \\nhowever , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . \\nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . \\nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . \\nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . \\nthankfully the film doesn\\'t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . \\nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . \\npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . \\nhe\\'s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . \\nwe learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it\\'s easy to sympathize with him . \\nnewell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . \\nas donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it\\'s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . \\nmost of the film tells the story of donnie\\'s life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn\\'t always seem to come together as a whole . \\nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . \\nthe resonance to donnie\\'s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn\\'t always seem to have much meaning . \\nback home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he\\'s never a and the family is suffering . \\nsince this is based on a true story i wouldn\\'t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . \\nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . \\na climax of sorts does occur , but there\\'s little feeling of a payoff . \\nwe get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . \\naside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . \\nit may be routine , but it\\'s good , and that\\'s respectful . \\n',\n"," b\"an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer . \\nyou may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it's hollywood existence . \\nwhen i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys . \\nthe monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves . \\nall of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark's office . \\nthe designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark's desk while flailing his arms and shrieking . \\nthe director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! ! ' \\nthe writing behind this project is embarrassing . \\nfor your amusement , i will explain the plot . \\ndr . kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr . heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on . \\nas the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences . \\nwhen they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler . \\nkinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team . \\nthere is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it's virtually identical to the plot in look who's talking ! \\n ( a far superior film in any league ) . \\nyou will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene . \\nsylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics . \\nquestion : it's obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ? \\nthe adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers . \\nit's a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes' familiar home alone formula . \\ni also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90's knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors . \\nthe effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny . \\nthe only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute' . \\ni suppose they are . \\ni can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute . \\nother instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script . \\nthere are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines . \\npeter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester's twin , are both miscast . \\nthen again , i don't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid . \\nmeanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha ) . \\ni would avoid baby geniuses at all costs . \\ninstead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling . \\nor perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters . \\nanything to avoid this painful movie . \\nthe final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is `if they think i'm doing the sequel for less than $20 mill , they're nuts' . \\nsequel ? \\nplease have mercy . \\n\",\n"," b'what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker . \\nthe dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! \\ni can hear batfans everywhere protesting : \" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! \" \\nand , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play . \\nnicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . \\nnicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the \\'60s tv series ) . \\non one hand , nicholson\\'s joker is extremely funny . \\nhis murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . \\nbut on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . \\nthe joker\\'s cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . \\nthis guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it ! \\nbut enough about nicholson as the joker : i\\'m sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . \\nlike many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . \\nbut batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting ! \\nkeaton delivers . \\nhe is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . \\neven though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . \\nvisually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team . \\nthe movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as \" the dark knight returns \" and \" the killing joke . \" \\nburton\\'s film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen . \\nthe sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations . \\nnicholson isn\\'t joking when he boasts , \" wait \\'till they get a load of me ! \" \\nhis grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . \\nkeaton\\'s wardrobe is equally appropriate . \\nbatman\\'s cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west\\'s campy costume in the tv series but peter weir\\'s outfit in robocop . \\nproduction designer anton furst\\'s sets are a wonder . \\ngotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york . \\nthe batcave is cold , bare , and desolate . \\nthe world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption . \\nthe movie\\'s gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold . \\nthe plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing . \\nthe screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting . \\nit takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear . \\nbatman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one . \\nas i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman\\'s psychological motives and underpinnings . \\nin terms of action , batman is not as thrilling as you might expect . \\nburton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story . \\nmore than anything , batman is a mood film . \\nwhile batman may not completely absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . \\nthanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world . \\n',\n"," b' \" idle hands \" is distasteful , crass and derivative . \\nif an original thought found its way into this horror-comedy it would die of loneliness . \\nplus , you have to question the judgment and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen-agers the week after the tragedy in littleton , colo . \\nthe movie is insulting to horror film fans and teen-agers . \\nthe plot , what little there is , deals with anton ( devon sawa ) , a high-school slacker who\\'s hand goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed . \\nalong the way the hand kills anton\\'s parents and his two best friends . \\nthe friends , also slackers , are so lazy that they return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them . \\nthat is the level of this\\'s atrocity\\'s humor . \\nthe movie treats death as a joke . \\n \" idle hands \" is gruesome and morbid . \\nthe performances are stereotypical and cartoonish . \\ni realize this is supposed to pass for comedy , but recent events have surpassed what is on the screen . \\nit is not the fault of the filmmakers that real life has overtaken reel life . \\nand i can only presume that the writers of \" idle hands , \" terri hughes and ron milbauer , were trying to make some statement about today\\'s young people and their values in a satiric vein . \\nhowever , it\\'s hard to laugh at death these days , especially ones involving young people . \\nwith the real horrors of the world put before us on television , a stale pastry such as \" idle hands \" should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths . \\n \" idle hands \" is bad , no matter the circumstances in the world outside . \\nbut the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings . \\nthe time is not right for this type of movie . \\nand as far as \" idle hands \" goes , the time may never be right . \\nthis is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema . \\n',\n"," b'i can\\'t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . \\nfor forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . \\nthen , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . \\nfeeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . \\nfeeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . \\nred\\'s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d\\'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie\\'s dreams . \\nenter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam\\'s estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie\\'s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . \\nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn\\'t ready to let them go without a fight . \\nfreddie , meanwhile , isn\\'t ready to let sam\\'s money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . \\nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam\\'s intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . \\nit does a great job of setting up jjaks\\' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves\\' wounded look is just right for jjaks . \\nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . \\nmost important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements\\' \" i will dare \" on the car radio . \\nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . \\nunfortunately , you would be dead wrong . \\ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn\\'t expect what i got . \\nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . \\nsuddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . \\nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . \\nvincent d\\'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . \\nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme\\'s something wild and neil jordan\\'s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn\\'t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . \\ni don\\'t want to dismiss baigelman\\'s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . \\nit _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can\\'t make his two halves into a whole . \\nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there\\'s not much funny about that . \\n',\n"," b'for a good ten years or so , super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene . \\nnow , he has followed in the footsteps of director john woo , ( who launched chow\\'s super stardom in the acclaimed \\'a better tomorrow\\' ) by moving to hollywood . \\ni had some reservations about this move and it would seem i was right to have them . \\nchow plays a hitman who is doing jobs in order to repay a debt . \\nhis final job requires him to kill a policeman\\'s seven year old boy . \\nthis he refuses do and runs . \\nhowever , he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned and replacement killers are brought in to do the job . \\ncue around 80 minutes of various and quite frankly tedious shoot- outs which take place in various locations . \\nsome thought had gone into making them a bit different but unfortunately they end up being just plain boring . \\nthe car wash scene , i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked . \\ntut tut . \\nthe emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on the accompanying music , ( i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie ) and not on the content . \\nmia sorvino ( a passport forger ) is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun . \\ndirector antoine arqua has clearly not observed chow\\'s excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots . \\nchow\\'s trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale ( which in fairness is quite good ) and there\\'s not even a toothpick in site . \\nand as for making chow shoot like a cop , well that\\'s damned unforgiveable . \\nto round up , the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for chow . \\nit would appear he has left asia for a 90 minute pop video . \\nthis is not what we wanted at all , considering john woo was the exec producer . \\n ( did he have no say so at all ? ) \\nwatch \\'the killer\\' again and weep at the difference . \\nreview by chris hill . \\n \" there\\'s room at the top , they are telling you still , but first you must learn how to smile as you kill , if you want to be like the folks on the hill . \" \\n',\n"," b'everybody in this film\\'s thinking of alicia . \\nno , this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the \" cryin\\' \" video . \\nthis is one of those erotic thrillers , but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed . \\nfirst off , there\\'s zero sex , almost no nudity , and it\\'s not as well-plotted as one of those tweed flicks . \\nwell , anyway . \\nthe \" plot . \" \\nalicia plays , well , the babysitter , who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents ( j . t . \\nwalsh and lee garlington ) go out to a party . \\nthe film , trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers , shows every characters\\' thoughts , except alicia\\'s . \\nthe thing is alicia\\'s in most of them in most cases , and the thoughts aren\\'t too kosher . \\nfirst off , there\\'s her boyfriend ( jeremy london , who gave one of the all-time lousy performances in \" mallrats , \" and is only a notch better here ) , who\\'s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully , played by nicky katt from \" suburbia \" ( who shows he\\'s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again ) . \\nthey decide they want to crash her babysitting job , looking for the typical babysitting hanky-panky . \\nsomethine like that . \\nthe film intercuts between the subplots ( alicia babysitting , nicky and jeremy , the party ) and each characters\\' thoughts . \\nwe get to see jeremy and nicky\\'s dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia , j . t . \\nthinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub ( she has it all covered up , the little tease ) , and , worst of all , lee garlington dreaming of that hunk , george segal . \\nit even shows them in bed together . \\nyea . \\ni so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i\\'m used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in \" flirting with disaster . \" \\nthe ending is some kind of big tragedy thing , but come on . \\nlike we care about any of the characters . \\nthe only interesting one is alicia , mainly because she\\'s alicia , and we mostly see her in the fantasies . \\nso i guess she\\'s some kind of mystery or something . \\nbut she is never explored further . \\nso , basically , this film is just a series of mastabatory images , sometimes featuring a non-nude alicia ( once again , sadly ) , sometimes featuring a scantily-clad george segal ( once again , sadly ) . \\ni watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the only way to watch this film . \\ni mean , there\\'s a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night : they\\'re just as good as sleeping pills . \\nand this one is one big fat waste of time , even for an alicia film . \\n',\n"," b\"the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . \\nyou kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . \\nas it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes . \\ninstead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . \\nthe laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . \\nthe film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . \\nhe loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . \\narthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . \\nhis personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . \\nin fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . \\nit's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . \\narthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . \\nshe has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . \\nveteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . \\nshe plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . \\narthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . \\narthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . \\njoey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . \\narthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! \\nhe finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations . \\nthe various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . \\nlike wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . \\nevery character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . \\nthe movie also offers a provocative look at technology . \\nwang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . \\nthe film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . \\nwang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . \\nwas einstein responsible for the a-bomb ? \\nis arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ? \\nthe movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw . \\naccording to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution . \\nironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking . \\nwang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w . \\ngriffith . \\ncinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look . \\nmason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target . \\nthe laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault . \\nwang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all . \\nfor instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems . \\nin weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands . \\noverall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction . \\non the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style . \\nthe heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film . \\nyou can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town . \\n\",\n"," b'i have never been so confused after watching a movie . \\n \" meet joe black \" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us . \\nat the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season . \\nat first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score . \\nthen you\\'ll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what\\'s going on , you\\'ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ? \\nthe script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture . \\nit feels like an eternity . \\nmost of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and \" meaningful \" winks . \\nthe film is based on alberto caesella\\'s play \" death takes a holiday \" . \\nthe story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying \" yes \" . \\nsoon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as \" death \" . \\nit is bill\\'s time . \\nbut death has other plans . \\nit has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive . \\nour bill is chosen to be death\\'s guide and in exchange he gets time . \\nbill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone\\'s attention . \\nbill\\'s business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill\\'s side , lives in his house and resides at his office . \\nthat is not all , however . \\nbill\\'s youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her . \\nthis relationship is bound to have some serious consequences . \\nit wouldn\\'t be fair to say that this film didn\\'t have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill\\'s family for dinner . \\nwhen joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different . \\nit is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure . \\nit\\'s one thing to say : \" wouldn\\'t it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . \" \\nto create a motion picture out of this is another . \\nfour screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic . \\nit is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film . \\non the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( \" scent of a woman \" ) . \\nhopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it . \\nhis talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment . \\nbut pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time . \\nhow can you play death in human form ? \\nto me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters . \\nthey are not creatures , but phenomenas . \\nsaying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form . \\nhandling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work . \\nspeaking in a calm , soft voice , portraying death as a lonely , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters . \\nhe looks and acts more like an angel of death , rather than a demon or a red-eyed executioner . \\nclaire forlani and others are also fine , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits . \\nunfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery . \\nin other words this is not what i expected from the director of \" scent of a woman \" . \\nit could ( and should ) be better with such cast and crew . \\nin the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera . \\n',\n"," b'movies don\\'t come much more ridiculously titled than \" i still know what you did last summer , \" but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous , the title sort of works as a warning . \\nmore than a silly-sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor , this horror sequel\\'s moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot : what \" you \" did _last_ summer \" you \" actually did the summer _before_ last summer , and since \" i \" knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer , it\\'s really illogical to say that \" i \" _still_ know what \" you \" did _last_ summer . \\nthe filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter \" i still know , \" the longer \" i still know what you did two summers ago \" or the appropriate \" stupid people getting hacked to bits . \" \\nthat last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart . \\nfor example , if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not long ago , would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet , even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress ? \\nprobably not , but that\\'s precisely what college student karla ( pop diva brandy ) does to best friend julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights . \\njulie , you\\'ll recall , was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997\\'s surprise hit \" i know what you did last summer , \" after a slasher with a grudge to bear - it\\'s a _long_ story - began trying to pick off her , her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village . \\nin this installment , the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas , and julie , yet racked by guilt , decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind . \\nyeah , right . \\ntheir island paradise has room , of course , for one more in the form of the still-alive killer ( muse watson ) from the first film . \\nhe sports the same gorton\\'s fisherman get-up , a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity , but why he\\'s still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves . . . \\nthough i suppose his hook-hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit . \\nin a sense , that\\'s the movie\\'s glaring flaw - everybody knows who the bad guy is , thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel . \\nthe murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary , but trey callaway\\'s derivative \" i still know \" screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims . \\nwhen julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed , giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all , what does he do ? \\nhe twist-ties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays - you\\'d think he\\'d want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later . \\neven prequel \" summer \" lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neat-o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh . \\nthe innovative gallows humor that scribe ( and \" scream \" wunderkind ) kevin williamson injected into \" i know \" \\'s unfolding story is sorely missed , replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like \" yo \" ; you\\'ll cheer - not shriek - when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest . \\nif \" i know what you did last summer , \" however effective , was just the kind of movie that those subversive \" scream \" flicks poked fun at , then the deadly \" i still know what you did last summer \" deserves a full-blown roasting on \" mystery science theatre 3000 . \" \\n',\n"," b'play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton\\'s sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways . \\nlike most of shelton\\'s other great films ( bull durham , white men can\\'t jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots . \\nshelton\\'s films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story . \\nshelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions . \\nplay it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse . \\nthe film has no social message like its predecessors . \\nthe relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons . \\nthe whole film , since it is primarily a \" buddy picture , \" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other . \\nunfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below . \\n1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet . \\nthe two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory . \\n2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas . \\nthere is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something . \\n3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way . \\nshe is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other . \\n4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories . \\nvince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner . \\nthese boring tales only hurt the central plot . \\n5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don\\'t even hesitate to pound each other . \\nwasn\\'t the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ? \\nby the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over . \\nshelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story . \\nforty five painful minutes remain . \\nthe boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies . \\nhowever , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film . \\n',\n"," b'capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen . \\none viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse . \\nthe idea is something about ghosts and the internet . \\nthe film has an amazing apocalyptic style . \\n , +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \\nperhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? ) \\nfilmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa . \\nhis films all seem to have one style , bleak . \\nthe worlds he creates are terrifying and cold . \\nlittle known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver . \\nmost of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid . \\nhis 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with . \\ncure is probably his classic . \\nlast year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon . \\nthat was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story . \\npulse is kurosawa back on form . \\ntaguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software . \\ntwo co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment . \\ntaguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software . \\nmeanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain . \\nwhen he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself . \\nif that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall . \\ntaguchi\\'s computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus . \\npeople whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide . \\nbut they are not entirely dead . \\ntheir spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet . \\npeople who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost . \\nif they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow . \\nthe computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist . \\nthis is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing \" like a computer disk . \" \\ninstead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses . \\nthere is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers . \\nleave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death . \\nthis is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work . \\nit may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish . \\nkurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion . \\nfrequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact . \\nhis plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange . \\njunichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa\\'s films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone . \\nimages are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain . \\nscenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might . \\npeople are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence . \\nseeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary . \\nkurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread . \\nof any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch . \\ni rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n"," b'according to popular film opinion , a film\\'s greatness is determined by time . \\ntake for example \" casablanca . \" \\ngreat film , even today . \\nit\\'s still as powerful as it was when it came out and still as romantic and tragic . \\nanother example would be \" star wars , \" which had a very , very healthy box office gross despite the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion times before . \\nbut as i rewatched \" independence day \" when it came out on video after being the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wasn\\'t as cool as when i had first seen it . \\ni had liked it when i saw it the first time ( * * * was my original view ) and basically saw it as a good \" escape film . \" \\nbut when i rewatched it , i felt cheated . \\nthus , the curse of the \" event film . \" \\n \" independence day \" is like that kid who come out of nowhere and makes everybody happy at once ( except for a couple kids - the critics , in this situation ) . \\nbut after a while , this kid becomes annoying and you just wait for the next one . \\nwell , this kid is the \" event film \" in my little analogy . \\nand when i rewatched \" independence day , \" not only did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insulted the whole time . \\nthere are too many gaping craters in the plot and you just aren\\'t sure if it\\'s comedy or hokey drama . \\none scene , you\\'ll see a hilariously nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you\\'ll see a bunch of military uptight guys walking around , saying corny lines . \\nthe worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig something innocently funny but is barked like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him the most unitentionally funniest speech since the end of \" glen or glenda ? \" \\nnow this annoying kid\\'s problem is that in the process of trying to make everyone like him all at once , he shows he has no balls . \\nand \" independence day \" has no balls . \\nit plays it safe everywhere . \\nit throws in a ton of action that is borrowed from other superior films . \\nthe chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of \" star wars . \" \\ni mean , isn\\'t that devil\\'s den ? \\nand the aliens are about as anticlimactic as demi moore\\'s breasts in \" striptease . \" \\nthey\\'re these octopus men , boring freaking octopus men . \\ni mean , come on . \\nthe aliens in \" 2001 \" were more interesting and you didn\\'t even see them ! \\nbasically the plot is straight from a b-movie from the 50s : aliens come to earth and we wonder if they\\'re hostile or peaceful . \\nokay , it\\'s an interesting topic , but it\\'s not handled greatly . \\nnow they aren\\'t and somehow a computer geek , jeff goldblum , figure out they\\'re using our satellites as a countdown to destruction . \\nyep . \\nthese aliens are not only heavily armed , they\\'re stupid too . \\nthey also use the same kind of computer as we do , but that comes about later . \\nthe president ( bill pullman ) , who\\'s under attack for being a wimp , decides this would be a nice time to be belligerent , and he decides he\\'ll stay in the white house which the aliens have covered . \\ni don\\'t care if it\\'s bob freaking dole in the white house , get him out of there . \\ni don\\'t care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol , just get him out of there . \\nlater on , he\\'s stupid and wants to fly in the attack on a big alien ship . \\ni think it\\'s time for impeachment for this guy . \\nhe\\'s more senile than reagan on pot . \\nthen there\\'s a cocky pilot ( will smith ) who is the only person to survive the counter-attack on the second day and becomes moses in leading his children to the elusive area 51 ( the film\\'s only sign of being brave ) . \\nhis girlfriend\\'s a stripper sharing a subplot with \" striptease \" in that she has to do it for her son . \\ncome on , she has a fighter pilot boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance . \\ni think she can quit that job and get a more respectable job at long john silvers . \\nshe\\'s also the few , the proud , the lucky to survive the igniting of l . a . ( as well as her dog , who narrowly survives ) . \\nthere are some bright spots . \\nthey tossed in enough old film homages to keep me laughing . \\nthe best one is when jeff goldblum ( nicely named david ) turns on his computer and a picture of hal comes up and says , \" good morning , dave . \" \\nand they even played r . e . m . \\'s \\n \" it\\'s the end of the world as we know it ( and i feel fine ) at the beginning . \\nand judd hirsch steals the film by actually acting great ( he\\'s a stereotype , but i just loved the man anyway ) . \\nbut there are no real subtle comic moments . \\nwill gets way too many one-liners and he has no one to play off of ( execept jeff towards the end , and the two do great ) . \\nas i said , this film has no balls . \\nit is just aiming for a crowd pleaser and that\\'s what it is . \\nbut after a couple months , we all move on to the next \" event \" film while intaking little films and a couple indy ones for good measure . \\nbut at least the indy ones last for a lifetime . \\nthis one\\'s short on batteries . \\n',\n"," b'in \" the 13th warrior , \" arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling up the king\\'s old lady . \\nwith his translator ( screen legend omar sharif in a small role ) , ahmed heads north to act as ambassador to the northmen ( vikings ) . \\nhe finds a group of warriors mourning the loss of their king . \\na messenger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance . \\na soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons , twelve northmen and one outsider . \\nthus , ahmed becomes the \" 13th warrior . \" \\non the trip , ahmed manages to learn the vikings\\' language by listening to their fireside conversations . \\na bit far-fetched , it\\'s true , but we have to swallow it if this flick is going to manage a few lines of dialogue amidst the grunting . \\nahmed , who\\'s called \" ibn \" by the vikings , forms friendships with herger the joyous ( dennis storh ? i ) and the viking leader buliwyf ( vladimir kulich ) . \\nwhen they arrive in the other kingdom , the thirteen warriors discover that they\\'re

cannibals attack the . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , you get the idea . \\njust to add some action , there\\'s also a viking vs . viking duel . \\nother movies insert scenes between the fights ; these scenes are called character development . \\ni suspect that \" the 13th warrior \" had a better script at one time and that it fell through the cracks because of the tag-team direction . \\nthe movie started off in the hands of john mctiernan ( you\\'ll notice a lot of similarities between \" warrior \" and mctiernan\\'s \" predator , \" including the chittering jungle sounds ) . \\nsomewhere along the line , mctiernan bailed and michael crichton took over . \\ncrichton , whose novel \" eaters of the dead \" is the basis for \" warrior , \" has directed a small assortment of goofy science-fiction \" thrillers \" : \" westworld , \" \" coma , \" \" looker , \" \" runaway . \" \\ntheir result of their consecutive efforts is a murky and pointless movie . \\nperhaps what \" the 13th warrior \" needs more than anything else is a villain . \\nthe \" eaters of the dead \" are a faceless mob in blackface . \\nthey have no personality , and by the end they don\\'t even seem particularly threatening . \\nthe audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression . \\nmctiernan should know about the importance of an interesting villain ; it was his \" die hard \" that made villains seem fun and attracted big-name stars to the evil roles in action films . \\n \" the 13th warrior \" suffers from a lack of vision . \\nit wants to be \" predator \" meets \" braveheart \" meets \" the magnificent seven \" meets \" dances with wolves . \" \\nwith so many competing goals , all it can do is echo what it might have been . \\nit might have been a satisfying action film . \\nit might have been a beautifully-rendered medieval epic . \\nit might have been a thought-provoking examination of the meeting of cultures . \\nwhat a shame it turned out to be nothing in particular . \\nbottom line : if you want to see antonio swing his sword , rent \" the mask of zorro . \" \\n',\n"," b'i had an epiphany today . \\nit occurred to me while i was watching \" house on haunted hill . \" \\nit is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it\\'s advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ? \\nchances are , there * is * truth in advertising . \\ntoo bad i didn\\'t trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie . \\ni blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of \" sleepy hollow . \" \\nthat and \" dogma \" started too late in the afternoon for my schedule . \\nan hour of \" angel \" or \" buffy \" is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face . \\ni wish i\\'d seen it when it was halloween . \\nat least i would have been forgiving . \\nhey , tis the season . \\nthe movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn\\'t going anywhere . \\nnow i truly appreciate films like \" scream , \" \" halloween , \" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic . \\nthat\\'s what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know . \\nthere has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with . \\nsure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that\\'s different from utterly nonsensical . \\nhohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand . \\n . \\n . \\nwell let\\'s just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago . \\nriiiiight . \\ny\\'know , that just sends chills down my spine . \\nyeah . \\njust like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil . \\nooooooo . \\nhint : blood and guts only work a few times . \\nsooner or later people start to tell themselves that it\\'s just ketchup and props and you\\'ve got to come up with something better than that . \\nthere were just too many things in this movie that we\\'ve all seen before ; from the inevitable \" plot developments \" of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare . \\neach was more predictable than the last . \\nwhy didn\\'t these fools just stay together in one place anyways ? \\nsheesh . \\nwas i grossed out ? \\nyes . \\ndid i get spooked a few times ? \\nyes . \\nbut why ? \\ni get really disturbed when there is no why . \\nwhen there weren\\'t random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which wasn\\'t that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue . \\nthe characters were incredibly flat and cliched . \\nnot to mention downright annoying . \\nyou\\'ve got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they\\'re dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night . \\njeez , i thought no one fell for those \" you may already be a winner \" things anymore . \\nand of course ,

1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) . \\n[theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture] \\nthere are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons . \\nthey provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation . \\nwatching \" flubber \" really clinched this idea for me , because it\\'s just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . \\nit proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story . \\nthe film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere . \\nwe meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist . \\nwithin the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is . \\nphillip\\'s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer\\'s disease - isn\\'t this rather lowbrow comedy ? \\nhe starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids\\' movie if i ever saw one ) . \\nwe learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he\\'s forgotten . \\nsara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she\\'ll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . \\nbut even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it\\'s no surprise the major conflicts here are related . \\nchristopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip\\'s ideas , but his woman too . \\nwhat\\'s worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! \\nwilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day . \\none of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film . \\nthe flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter . \\nit\\'s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . \\nunfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing . \\nflubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object . \\nmost of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip\\'s absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along . \\nbut it\\'s clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse . \\nall the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don\\'t fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air . \\nit\\'s all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes . \\nduring the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , \" i think they might be cheating , \" to which the referee replies , \" there\\'s no rules about jumping too high . \" \\n \" predictable \" doesn\\'t begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point . \\nand it\\'s not how terribly contrived the plot is , it\\'s the way it\\'s broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition . \\nnot only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears . \\ni\\'d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it\\'s almost forgivable when you realize they\\'re talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . \\nit\\'s safe to say everything that could be bad about \" flubber \" is . \\nthe only original element the film has is the world\\'s first romance between a machine and a human . \\nbut this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won\\'t . \\n',\n"," b'for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what\\'s left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things . \\nas a rule , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor . \\nan actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck . \\ngenerally , though , the actor doesn\\'t matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers , exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz . \\nthe star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less . \\nrussell plays todd , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought . \\nthe movie lets us see this degenerate process , but by the time the real plot starts , we\\'re into todd\\'s later years . \\nhe\\'s about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers , ones who , instead of being trained * from * birth , are genetically selected * before * birth . \\nthe pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he\\'s the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie\\'s start . \\nbetween the two leads , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken , and it\\'s possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction . \\ndirector paul anderson , who helmed last year\\'s icy thriller , event horizon , doesn\\'t show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam . \\ntodd , upon being replaced , is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out , the villains return to the garbage planet on a \" routine patrol \" and set the stage for the final firefight . \\nevents are predictable from the time that the setups are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here . \\nthe most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact , not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry . \\nit\\'s not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it . \\nthe best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare , like universal soldier . \\na strict interpretation , however , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style , class , or substance ; and by next year , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television . \\n',\n"," b'in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather . \\nwas it \" deep \" ? \\nnope . \\nhowever it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up . \\nit was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was \" without the comic book uplift \" of the indiana jones and superman pictures . \\nwhich was true . \\nif what you were looking

penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman\\'s nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman\\'s body she gets pushed off a building . \\ni admire mr . burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess . \\nnothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten . \\nhints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast . \\nalas , these are only hints . \\nthere are , don\\'t misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis . \\na weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing . \\n',\n"," b'if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell\\'s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era\\'s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \\nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \\nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \\nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \\nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers\\'s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \\nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \\nboring . \\nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_\\'s lifelessness . \\n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o\\'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \\nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \\nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \\nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers\\' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club\\'s famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow\\'s feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she\\'s a peripheral character at best ) . \\nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \\nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \\neven whit stillman\\'s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn\\'t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \\ndancing isn\\'t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher\\'s fault . \\nfrom what i\\'ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54\\'s legend . \\nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \\naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane\\'s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \\nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \\nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \\nthey fail on both counts . \\nultimately , _54_\\'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \\nas in , there isn\\'t any to be had for the audience . \\ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \\nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \\nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn\\'t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film\\'s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \\nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \\nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \\nthey\\'re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \\nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there\\'s still a great disco movie to be made . \\nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \\n',\n"," b'my first press screening of 1998 and already i\\'ve gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . \\nwhat an auspicious beginning ! \\nwelcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . \\nfirestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves\\'s academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year\\'s crop of movies . \\nas our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are \" smokejumpers . \" \\nwe then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from \" cosmopolitan . \" \\nhaving the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . \\nwhen , even in the beginning , the director can\\'t get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . \\nwith the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . \\nnot bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . \\nmiraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . \\nin a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . \\nas it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl\\'s face . \\nour show\\'s two heroes , the crew\\'s chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . \\nin a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . \\nthe manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . \\nthis mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . \\nthe chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . \\nwill it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica\\'s two firefighting buddies ? \\nshe has only seconds to decide who will be saved . \\nyes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . \\nnot content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth\\'s screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . \\n ( \" hoods in the woods , \" is what the \" ground-pounders \" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) \\nalong the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . \\nmost of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . \\nhe flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . \\narguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . \\nusing a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building\\'s attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . \\nwhen the film isn\\'t using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . \\neditor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . \\nthe ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . \\nperhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , \" it\\'s not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . \" \\nfirestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . \\nit is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . \\n',\n"," b'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \\nfirst , there\\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \\nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \\nno no . . . \\njust kidding . \\nhad you going there for a moment , didn\\'t i ? \\nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \\nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \\nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \\nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \\nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \\ni\\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \\nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\\'t try to overachieve . \\nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \\nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \\nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \\nshao khan has decided that he\\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \\nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \\none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \\ntoo bad they didn\\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \\ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \\n * the acting is truly bad . \\nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \\n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \\nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \\ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \\n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \\n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \\nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \\n . . . unless you\\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \\nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \\n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \\nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \\nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \\n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \\nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \\na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \\n * there aren\\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \\nsilly , silly folks . \\nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \\nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \\n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \\nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \\nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \\nyou\\'ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \\n',\n"," b'i rented \" brokedown palace \" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws . \\nfor anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety . \\nthat is no easy task . \\nsuperficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably \" return to paradise \" and \" midnight express . \" \\nas a result nearly every review of \" brokedown palace \" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons . \\nthe consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film . \\nfor those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was \" midnight express \" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of \" return to paradise . \" \\nin my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad\\'s acclaimed novel , \" lord jim . \" \\nproblematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world \" justice \" system . \\nthe girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) . \\nthey\\'re life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents . \\nonce there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside . \\nthey get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl\\'s scam . \\nhe then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene . \\nby now alarm bells are going off among viewers . \\nthe ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don\\'t add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice . \\nlong before it happens , we\\'re anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin . \\njust as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch . \\nleft unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice . \\nfor those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl\\'s fleabag hotel . \\nas one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer \" yankee hank \" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife . \\na recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film\\'s tag lines , \" who do you trust ? , \" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman\\'s oeuvre will find few surprises . \\nmuch of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion . \\nlou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments . \\nis he part of a wider conspiracy ? \\nwith an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them . \\nthe result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls\\' interaction , hank\\'s investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape . \\nif \" brokedown palace \" has a major flaw , it is its creators\\' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story\\'s main avenue . \\nand , if that were all there was to \" brokedown palace , \" it wouldn\\'t be a very good movie . \\nbut i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded . \\nfor the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations . \\nultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing . \\nyoung and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure . \\npresented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) . \\nclear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend . \\nshe comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) . \\nwhereas darlene\\'s life is \" on-track , \" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and \" fulfillment , \" alice\\'s is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning . \\none poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo . \\ntellingly , alice is present but not included . \\njust as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice\\'s face doesn\\'t read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while \" dar \" remains seated in the shade . \\n \" brokedown palace \" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank . \\nhowever unintentional , it\\'s all alice\\'s fault . \\nshe\\'s responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick . \\n ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film\\'s beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . ) \\ndar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence . \\nnever mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate . \\ndar is innocent . \\nit doesn\\'t matter . \\nalice is the subject of this movie . \\nshe and her journey toward personal freedom . \\nalong the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals . \\nin the end , that culture , like its representatives , \" yankee \" hank and dar\\'s father ( a \" man who knows how to grease the wheels \" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl\\'s tragedy . \\nthailand\\'s culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison . \\nit amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes . \\ni believe the filmmaker\\'s view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior . \\nthe thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles . \\nthe girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born . \\ntheir prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit . \\nthe prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and \" hard manual labor \" consisted of picking grass ! \\nthe thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic . \\nas for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film\\'s penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality . \\n\\'freedom\\' has many faces and \" brokedown palace \" explores many of them . \\nin the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit . \\nsome settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter . \\nbut freedom seldom comes without a price . \\nwhich is why the movie\\'s other tag lines are : \" what is your dream ? \" \\nand \" how far would you go ? \" \\ni believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film\\'s end is alice . \\nshe finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility . \\ni think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact . \\nkate beckinsale\\'s character might more properly be likened to the \" released \" temple bird referred to twice during the film , \" trained to fly back to its cage . \" \\nas the thai magistrate observed in the film\\'s climactic scene , the issue was always one of \" character ; \" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that \" freedom \" is achieved within oneself . \\nif one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ? \\nincreasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of \\'kung fu woman\\'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures . \\nhere , at last , is the story of a modern heroine . \\nin reading the many user\\'s comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors . \\nthink about that . \\nwhen was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ? \\ndo yourself a favor : rent \" brokedown palace \" and watch it with a open mind . \\nthere\\'s more there than meets the eye . \\n',\n"," b\"i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone's `any given sunday' . \\nit's an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock-em , sock-em profession of pro football . \\nunfortunately , the director seems to have only one priority on his mind : sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers . \\nin altering each frame with quick-flash photography and dizzying , in-your-face editing , stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics . \\nwe see glimpses of greatness , but `any given sunday' has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy-gook . \\nit grows tiresome and monotonous . \\nyes , stone has pulled a brian depalma . \\nmatters of importance are pushed aside right from the get-go . \\ntony d'amato ( al pacino ) , coach of the struggling miami sharks , finds his team stuck in a losing rut . \\naging quarterback cap rooney ( dennis quaid ) appears to be losing his touch , and d'amato can't seem to ignite any passion in his squad . \\nwhen cap is injured on the field , and after a patch of unlikely events occur , third-string qb willie beaman ( jamie foxx ) is brought into the game . \\nonce in the huddle ( and this becomes an in-game ritual ) , beaman horks all over the field . \\nnerves , you see . \\neventually though , the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates , sparking his rise to fame in the football world - the endorsements , the music videos , etc . - and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind-the-scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like . \\nand i believe it . \\nthere is some intriguing insight posed , but in the big scheme of things , stone fumbles the ball . \\nthe problem with the director's visual approach is this : he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate . \\nfootball is an exciting game to watch , but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush . \\ni guess he is mistaken . \\n`any given sunday' is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them . \\nmany football fans ( including one i attended with ) are liable to be disappointed with the `ultra-stylish' way stone has decided to present the game . \\nin return , a three-star film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the director's tampering . \\nin welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break , this actually shows decent character development and interaction . \\nfor instance , heated returns between d'amato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci ( cameron diaz ) are enjoyable to watch . \\nthere is also a solid performance from jamie foxx , who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory . \\nthe stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine , aaron eckhart , lauren holly , ann-margret and charlton heston ( in an extraordinarily brief appearance ) . \\nunfortunately , too many big names are wasted - a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast . \\npacino makes some interesting progress with his character . \\nyou begin to identify with coach d'amato and the morals he is striving for . . . . \\nbut i often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics . \\n`any given sunday' is a watchable but disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to excessive filmmaking technique . \\nand a very distant back seat , at that . \\n\",\n"," b'after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy . \\nthis new film has been underrated for no reason . \\nit is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla\\'s pervious films . \\nit is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . \\nthe only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some \" unfinished \" developments of some characters . \\nthe film elegantly begins with nino rota\\'s recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael\\'s voice as he is writing a letter to his children : \" the only wealth in this world is children . \\nmore than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure \" . \\nthe year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of \" part ii \" to make his father\\'s dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . \\nmichael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . \\nconstantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children . \\nthe family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . \\nlater that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , \" a check in the amount of $100 million . \" \\nbut the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness . \\nsure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin . \\nbut god does not take payoffs . \\nthe plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican . \\nthere is a moment in \" godfather iii \" where michael says : \" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal . \\nbut the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . . \" \\n . \\nvisually this film is as spectacular as the first two . \\ngordon willis\\' rich cinematography , carmine copolla\\'s beautiful composition and alex tavoularis\\' wonderful art direction could not be better . \\nbut copolla\\'s first two godfather-films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection . \\nthe third installment has only the plot and visuals . \\nsome characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films . \\nthe biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional . \\nthe best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars . \\nandy garcia is powerful as sonny\\'s son , strong , focused and loyal . \\nviolence is natural to him . \\nhe suffers no pangs of conscience when he takes revenge on his family\\'s behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was . \\nhowever both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless . \\nand characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed . \\nthe good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films . \\nin the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger . \\nthis parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo\\'s character was more developed . \\nmany have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary . \\ni disagree . \\nit is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family . \\nthe first film showed some horrible results of corleone\\'s life . \\nit showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times . \\na man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him . \\nthe third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael\\'s life . \\nthe life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed . \\nthere is no turning back . \\nand no matter how hard you try to get out of it , to free yourself , no matter how powerful and wealthy you are , you are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely . \\nthe beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead . \\nhere he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven \\n',\n"," b'at one point during brian de palma\\'s crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : \" can\\'t you stop saying \\'fuck\\' all the time ? \" \\nfucking good question , that . \\nit may not be an honour that instills the filmmakers with pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone\\'s script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history . \\nyet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma\\'s scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick . \\nthe overall structure is similar to howard hawks\\' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti-hero\\'s chosen vice is cocaine traffiking . \\npacino , sporting a thick cuban accent , gives one the best performances of his career ( golden globe nominated ) as tony montana , a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream . \\nand live it out he does , with lashings of violence , abuse , murder and the funny white powder . \\nfrom his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen , tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he\\'s not a man to be fucked ( sorry ) . \\nsoon he\\'s the king of the cocaine heap , but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing . \\n \" never do your own stash \" , warns one character early in the film . \\nas sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls . \\nwriter oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here . \\nstone\\'s script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development . \\nmontana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience . \\na man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not wanting her to be sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits . \\npacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting . \\npfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no inner life . \\nonly once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she\\'s happy to oblige . \\nthis isn\\'t as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone\\'s was in casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well . \\nas director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva . \\nthe escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola . \\nwhere he differs from , say , coppola\\'s godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment . \\ncoppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep , whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel . \\nand it perfectly suits the material . \\nthe only major botch is giorgio moroder\\'s mostly crap synthesier score . \\nit\\'s just not right , and unfortunately compromises the impact of some otherwise good scenes . \\nas expected , scarface is very violent at times , but you shouldn\\'t be watching gangster movies if that upsets you . \\nat over two and a half hours in length it\\'s a true epic , and if you\\'re a fan of the genre you\\'ll love f * * k-filled minute of it . \\n',\n"," b'i think maybe it\\'s time for the batman series to be put to rest . \\nnot only has the first two films\\' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a \" superhero \" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment . \\nlet me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o\\'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond . \\nmr . freeze\\'s thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum . \\ni might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don\\'t think that\\'s what this movie is supposed to be . \\nafter all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony . \\nnot any more ; the list goes on and on in this one . \\nrobin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman . \\nmr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond . \\na world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons . \\nmy very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her . \\nnot bad , but wouldn\\'t the police ( or maybe batman ? ) \\nnotice if the road was on fire ? \\ni knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but . \\n . \\n . \\n . \\nit also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment . \\nas if three protagonists and two villains weren\\'t enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne\\'s butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn\\'t surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce\\'s girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie . \\nall this might be semi-excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it isn\\'t . \\nin fact , it\\'s kind of boring . \\nmr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson\\'s joker and danny devito\\'s penguin . \\ntheir evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , \" today gotham city , tomorrow the world ! \" ) \\nas it is lame-brained ( didn\\'t it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) . \\nand robin\\'s constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull-headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place . \\nstrip away the stars , the fancy set design , and the status as a \" batman movie , \" and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick . \\n',\n"," b'aspiring broadway composer robert ( aaron williams ) secretly carries a torch for his best friend , struggling actor marc ( michael shawn

mara hobel ) , spends her days lying about their apartment and harrassing magazine editor tina brown . \\nwriter-director victor mignatti\\'s \" very romantic comedy \" ( as the ad campaign states ) is supposed to be ( pardon the pun ) a gay ol\\' romp , but it\\'s hard to have much fun with these annoying , self-absorbed characters and their shallow personal problems : marc and cynthia have sitcom-level domestic \" crises \" ( such as trying to kill bugs--how hilarious ) ; robert and marc go to acting class ( how riveting ) ; the zaftig cynthia goes on eating binges ( how original ) . \\nbut more than anything else , the three whine . \\nconstantly . \\nmarc whines about his turbulent romance with an apparent \" 10 , \" david ( hugh panaro ) , the hunky musician from across the way

you\\'ll be thankful for that . \\nwith his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire . \\nand like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script . \\nsince the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited . \\n>from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious . \\nrome\\'s best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) waging a war against germania . \\nscott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective . \\nit\\'s blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted . \\nas soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who . \\nit\\'s a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch . \\ninstead , the general swears he will get out after this battle . \\nhe wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life . \\nbut , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that . \\nthe dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies . \\nhe asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators . \\nall of this does not go well for aurelius\\' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor . \\njealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus\\' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus . \\nbut maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius\\' wishes . \\nnow a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success . \\na story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick . \\nyou actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way . \\nphoenix plays his character brilliantly . \\nthink of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , \" respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man \" brat who hates when he\\'s not the center of attention . \\nevery scene we see commodus , he\\'s either crying or he looks like he has just been crying . \\nphoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he\\'s more than just river\\'s little brother . \\ncrowe is also excellent as the film\\'s grisly-faced hero . \\nmaximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions . \\nthis guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he\\'s no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being ! \\nthe rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate . \\nridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general . \\nthe visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 . \\nthe costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians . \\ngladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience . \\nalong with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 . \\n',\n"," b'1989\\'s \" major league \" was a delightful surprise . \\ni didn\\'t expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable , but it proved to be fresh and funny . \\nhowever , when the appeal of a movie is its freshness , the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale . \\nthat\\'s certainly true of \" major league ii \" and the most recent entry , \" major league : back to the minors . \" \\nthe title is , of course , a contradiction . \\nshouldn\\'t it be \" minor league ? \" \\nthat contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer/director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie . \\noriginal stars charlie sheen and tom berenger ( who returned for \" major league ii \" ) are not around , leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie . \\nthe other veterans who return ( dennis haysbert as voodoo-inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka , who was introduced in \" league ii \" ) seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise . \\nthe only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle , inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf . \\nthe protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell ( scott bakula ) , who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn ( bernsen ) to manage the twins\\' aaa team , the buzz . \\nyou can write the movie from here : he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win . \\nthere\\'s a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing ( walton goggins ) , an ex-ballet dancer ( kenneth johnson ) , a broken-down old timer ( thom barry ) , twin outfielders both named juan ( the difilippo triplets ) , and a couple pitchers with throwing problems ( judson mills and peter mackenzie ) . \\nalong the way , gus picks up cerrano and tanaka ( gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs , even though he wasn\\'t in either of the preceding films ) . \\nsum total : none . \\nthe entire enterprise is artificial , and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors . \\ngus\\' antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ( ted mcginley ) . \\nleonard is a slimy , sniveling little egotist , and the twins are lazy , spoiled , and full of themselves . \\n ( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real-life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner ) . \\ngus challenges leonard to a match , the buzz vs . the twins . \\n ( wanna guess who wins ? ) \\n \" back to the minors \" is a movie that has no reason to exist . \\nthere\\'s hardly a laugh in it , the cast is weak , and the first movie left no room for even one sequel . \\n',\n"," b'in the finale of disney\\'s \" mighty joe young , \" a 15-foot tall , 2000-pound gorilla holds a frightened young boy in its clutches as it topples from a crippled ferris wheel and plummets to the ground . \\nupon impact , rugged everyman and perennial do-gooder bill paxton rushes in , containing the emotional crowd with an earnest \" move along now folks , there\\'s nothing to see here . \" \\nok , so those aren\\'t exactly the words he uses , but it\\'s probably one of the few clich ? s not uttered in this unnecessary remake of an unnecessary remake of that mother of all monster movies , \" king kong . \" \\n1949\\'s \" mighty joe young \" was an update of that classic creature feature , also based on merian c . cooper\\'s original story ( 16 years after \" \\'kong \" it appeared the world was ready for a new take on the beauty and the beast fable ) . \\nnow some 49 years later , at least according to disney\\'s way of thinking , the world is ready for one more . \\nnot so . \\nthe only--and i mean only--reason to see the 1998 version is for the special effects . \\nand these , unfortunately , run hot and cold . \\ntoday\\'s joe young is designed and produced by special-effects whiz rick baker , who has been wowing audiences with his state-of-the-art make-up effects since 1971\\'s \" schlock \" ( which , incidentally , featured a baker-enhanced \" gorilla \" ) . \\njoe is a combination of animatronic effects , computer graphics , and that old standard , a man in a monkey suit . \\nwhile there are occasional flashes of brilliance--baker\\'s had a lot of practice with simian effects , after all , including \" gorillas in the mist , \" \" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes , \" and the 1976 remake of \" king kong \" --there\\'s also some surprising cheesiness . \\none of the film\\'s most embarrassing moments is when paxton\\'s band of african trackers first encounter and pursue the larger-than-life primate ( in a scene unashamedly ripped off from \" the lost world : jurassic park \" ) . \\npaxton jubilantly extols the beast\\'s majestic gait at the same exact moment as joe , and the computer effects driving him , stutter to a halt . \\nalso , if the film\\'s producers had wanted us to focus our attentions on the titular ape they shouldn\\'t have paraded female lead charlize theron ( \" trial & error \" ) around in a seemingly-endless wardrobe of spaghetti-strapped tops . \\neven joe seems distracted at times . \\nthe film piles on the clich ? s like there\\'s no tomorrow , including the predictable plot ( anthro-zoologists ship gigantic gorilla to l . a . where urban havoc is inevitably wrought ) , predictable villain ( a lithuanian i think i overheard someplace ) , predictable love story ( bill and charlize--surprise ! ) , and predictable denouement ( \" \\'twas box-office receipts that killed the beast \" ) . \\nkids raised on \" men in black \" ( non-monkey effects also by baker ) are going to find ron ( \" tremors \" ) underwood\\'s outing a little lame by comparison . \\nwhile certainly better than 1978\\'s \" king kong lives \" ( itself a lousy sequel to a not particularly good remake ) , \" mighty joe young \" proves how the mighty keep falling . \\n',\n"," b'the best thing about , \" lake placid \" is that it\\'s only 80 minutes long and when it\\'s over you\\'re glad that you didn\\'t waste more than an hour and a half of your time . \\nit\\'s nothing more than a bad rip-off of , \" jaws \" ( and i think that\\'s being kind . ) \\nit was written by david e . kelly ( \" ally mcbeal \" ) as a horror-comedy but fails at both , miserably . \\ni was never scared and i think that i only laughed once . \\nthe crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , \" anaconda . \" \\nthe plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine . \\nthat brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish-and-game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate . \\nalso , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover ( oliver platt ) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast . \\nsoon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it . \\nthere\\'s also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets . \\nas i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor ( h20 ) don\\'t go for a serious approach towards the material but they also don\\'t have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either . \\nthe betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting , they\\'re all basically idiots . \\nif they had any brains the croc wouldn\\'t have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldn\\'t have put themselves in half of the situations that they did . \\nbut then again , if they were smart there wouldn\\'t be a movie . \\nbasically , \" lake placid \" is best undiscovered . \\n',\n"," b\"everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here . \\nwincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence . \\nbilly zane is wooden as the hero . \\nkristy swanson is given very little to do , and does very little with it . \\ntreat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie . \\nonly catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance . \\nshe has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of . \\noh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you won't even care . \\nabout the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery . \\nhowever , if youre looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper . \\nthis is not a good movie . \\n\",\n"," b'sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it . \\nit seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence . \\ni wouldn\\'t be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it . \\nthe title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began . \\nof course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film . \\ndisturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous . \\nit\\'s a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex . \\nit\\'s a suspense film with no suspense . \\nit\\'s an evil small town story with no story to speak of . \\nit\\'s a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits . \\nour main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden . \\nhe moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself . \\nsteve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally . \\nthe big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends . \\nmarsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject . \\nas a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) . \\ngavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people . \\nso , it\\'s up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it . \\nby the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn\\'t make any sense . \\ndisturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg . \\ni\\'ve seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he\\'s doing when it comes to screenwriting . \\nhe did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out . \\nevil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work . \\nrosenberg\\'s script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization . \\nand it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally \" explained . \" \\nthere is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening . \\nthey get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures . \\nthe doctor responsible for all this , dr . caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) . \\nmuch of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act . \\nin one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria . \\nup front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once . \\nthat aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown . \\nfor instance , he points to the \" nerds , \" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops . \\nit\\'s such an obvious cliche that i can\\'t believe rosenberg even bothered . \\nmost of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , \" bite me ! \" \\nanymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit . \\nthis picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy . \\nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry . \\nhorror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid . \\nthere are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) . \\ni also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler . \\nhe has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking . \\nthe acting is largely a waste of talent . \\nmarsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) . \\nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted . \\nstahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn\\'t good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl\\'s performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) . \\nnone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn\\'t all that cool . \\ndisturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began . \\ni\\'m surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office . \\nit\\'s not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it\\'s an uninspired lump of a film . \\nit sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable . \\nso , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends . \\n',\n"," b'plot outline - wendy ( samantha press ) , a jazz singer , loves mack ( hugo race ) a criminal and wanna be rock singer who\\'s planning a bank heist . \\nmack is also being

has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption . \\nmeanwhile wendy\\'s sexually awakener , fifteen year old sister ( rebecca elmaloglou ) has moved in with her , and is secretly watching mack and wendy\\'s late night love trysts ? much zaniness ensues \\nthe review : main problem first - about 2% of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work . \\nunfortunately , trying to cast hugo race as a violent , sexy criminal falls into the \" what the hell where they thinking \" category that takes up 98% of the rest . \\nbut , hell , it\\'s not as if he\\'s the only problem in this well-intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller . \\nleads , race and samantha press are wooden and dull , hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on . \\nthough they do manage some heat later in their love scenes , helped , no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut . \\nthe film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two . \\nwhich is unfortunately , the other main story isn\\'t any great shakes either . \\nthe second part , concerning two cops , political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled . \\nat many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on , a situation that didn\\'t improve on repeated viewing . \\nthere is no doubt that this film\\'s achilles heel is its script . \\nas for the rest of the cast , it\\'s a mixed bag . \\njohn flaus , one of australia\\'s most criminally underused actors , is in top form as the withering , alcoholic jazz fan cop , who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder . \\nalthough he falters at one point , when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon , but believe me , they way it was written , no one could have pulled it off . \\ndominic sweeney is fine , though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really isn\\'t given a whole lot to do . \\npre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo , but her character seems extraneous to the story , well , at least until the final scenes . \\ni must admit , in too deep does have some impressive qualities , not the least of which is it visual element . \\ncinematographers mark gilfedder & peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city , which is akin to turning london into san paolo . \\nthe bar is an oppressive red , like all of it\\'s patrons are being baked while they drink , outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night . \\nif only deborah parson\\'s script could have supported this idea better . \\nhaving two director\\'s ( colin south & john tatoulis ) doesn\\'t help either , the most glaring example of which is the final retribution/fight scene , where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action , and more importantly it doesn\\'t pull away to anything else . \\nit just stays static as the fight happens in the distance . \\nit has no reason to it ; it\\'s just bad direction . \\nand , ultimately , that is what sums up in too deep , it\\'s tries to be good , and you want it to work , but , it\\'s just lacking the talent behind it , that it needs to succeed . \\n',\n"," b'what\\'s shocking about \" carlito\\'s way \" is how good it is . \\nhaving gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino\\'s previous film , \" scent of a woman , \" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , \" carlito\\'s way \" was destined for underrated heaven . \\nthat\\'s what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . \\nand what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . \\n \" carlito\\'s way \" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . \\nof course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he\\'s really a crook at heart . \\ncarlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can\\'t escape into something he is not . \\ncarlito\\'s attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . \\nwhen he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive . \\nhe\\'s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he\\'s doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking . \\ncarlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that\\'s where it\\'s at ) , but needs some funding . \\nbeing a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c . \\nand the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . \\nhe gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he\\'s constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco \" from the bronx \" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . \\non the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison . \\nshe\\'s a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . \\nwhile this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . \\nall of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . \\nwhen i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . \\nsure , it\\'s going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . \\nwhat\\'s amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . \\nlike \" apollo 13 , \" we know what\\'s going to happen , but we\\'re still thrilled by what happens in the middle . \\nit\\'s also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . \\nde palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . \\nhis earlier flim , \" scarface \" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i\\'m still not over ) . \\nbut de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . \\nto me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . \\nthis is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . \\nwith a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito\\'s head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino\\'s face , it\\'s a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) . \\nthe acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . \\npacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn\\'t puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn\\'t as \" strong \" as his oscar-winning role in \" scent of a woman . \" \\nwell , his \" scent of a woman \" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a \" foghorn leghorn impression . \" \\nin \" carlito\\'s way , \" he\\'s emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he\\'s remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change . \\ni felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in \" scent of a woman . \" \\nas i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . \\nand they\\'re scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . \\nand sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney . \\nevery scene he\\'s in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . \\nin smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . \\n \" carlito\\'s way \" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you\\'re absolutely blown away . \\nit\\'s a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn\\'t do so hot . \\nbut trust me and check it out . \\nit\\'s a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right . \\n',\n"," b'it\\'s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it\\'s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . \\ni\\'d saw that it\\'s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i\\'m hardly comparing \" a simple plan \" to , say , \" rear window \" or \" strangers on a train . \" \\nyet it\\'s almost as good . \\nit\\'s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . \\nelegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , \" a simple plan \" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . \\nwithout anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don\\'t flaunt anything they don\\'t want to flaunt , they\\'ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . \\nthe possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \\n \" a simple plan , \" though borrows a little from each of these . \\na little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . \\nbut , as austin powers would say , that\\'s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . \\nwhat i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it\\'s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . \\nit effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . \\nso while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . \\nin one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn\\'t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) . \\ninstead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton\\'s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . \\nthere\\'s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he\\'s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching . \\nin short , probably the best piece of direction raimi\\'s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch \" persona \" \\'s \" sex scene \" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman\\'s ever done ) . \\nbut the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . \\nyet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . \\nwhen the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . \\nthere\\'s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don\\'t come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror . \\nduring the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra \" they can\\'t do this , can they ? \" \\nstreeming through my head . \\nin fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen\\'s [superior , but forget about it] \" fargo , \" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then \\nagain , after seeing the \" evil dead \" films , i\\'d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed \" raimi \" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) . \\ninstead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . \\nmost particularly , billy bob thornton\\'s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . \\nhis dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there\\'s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we\\'re not totally laughing at him . \\nthe chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real . \\njacob\\'s a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . \\nthe final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . \\ni particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . \\nthornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he\\'s ever given and further proof that he\\'s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don\\'t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn\\'t been in the same year ) because he\\'s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . \\nhe brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it\\'s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . \\nthe rest of the cast is great too , from paxton\\'s declining working man to chelcie ross\\' amiable town sheriff . \\neven fonda shows off her talents nicely . \\nand if i had any complaints about the film , it\\'s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . \\nand the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you\\'re trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn\\'t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . \\nand , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . \\ni won\\'t reveal it , but it\\'s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn\\'t already too much of that anyway . \\nfor a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . \\nimagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it\\'s like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i\\'m at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . \\nthe ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . \\nbut despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i\\'ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . \\nat least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece . \\n',\n"," b\"synopsis : the president of a company wants to test his self-appointed successor , who's psychotic , and thinks it's a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall . \\ncomments : tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it . \\nstrike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape's sticker in black marker ( not typically a good sign when you rent a film ) . \\nstrike two came while the previews played . \\ndid you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie's quality ( or lack thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ? \\nwell , the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad ( definately not a good sign ) . \\ntracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout . \\nabout the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery . \\nto be fair , the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller . \\nwolf larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film's title . \\njames brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten . \\nbrolin's character , for some inexplicable reason , thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin , practically isolated , with lebrock and larson , whom he's decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company . \\nby the time the characters arrive at the cabin , this film begins to become tedious . \\napparently , brolin's successor's test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing , which don't seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city . \\nbut , then again , what do i know about business ? \\ni do think , though , that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin ; its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch . \\nlarson's character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill . \\nthis leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters , which really isn't enough to sustain it . \\nthe film's writer must have taken a cue from stephen king , as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald's game . \\nlarson and lebrock fight and torture each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help . \\nsome old guy's around too , just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film . \\nthe old guy , however , miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it's worthy of a chuckle or two . \\noutside of that chuckle , unfortunately , tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors , for some reason , become increasing obnoxious . \\nif you're in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey , don't . \\nmake tracks to a far superior suspense film , like misery . \\n\",\n"," b\"an 80-year

\\nmind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there's something about mary' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber' ) can be extremely funny . \\nunfortunately , `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired . \\n`ready to rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling . . . . \\nwhich , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy . \\nbut director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome' . \\ngordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics . \\nby day , they transport raw sewage . \\nby night ( particularly on ? nitro' monday ) , they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) , the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community . \\nwith two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance , gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first-hand . \\nbut unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano , sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans . \\nsinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp , thereby dethroning

' \\nthey take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt . \\nalong the way , you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well . \\nyou may find something to like in `ready to rumble' if a ) you are a rasslin' aficionado yourself , or b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low-brow comedies . \\ni welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is , if its fresh and resourceful . \\n`rumble' is nothing but a sloppy , frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation . \\nthe first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience . \\nluckily , the simple-minded events pick up steam , particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action . \\ndirector robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues' , and when in the ring , he does professional work . \\nbut the violence is too excessive . \\nhaving the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart's tragic accident just last year , especially with one character's dive during a cage match . \\nthis is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of . \\noutside the wrestling action , the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term ? scattershot' , while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10 , with brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from `diddly' to `boob' and so on . \\nthe final tally : i chuckled a few times , groaned a lot , and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105 . \\ncasting-wise , `ready to rumble' is an odd duck . \\noliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ? \\nhe's perhaps a bit chunky , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty' , which dampens the blow i suppose . \\nrose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls , ' proclaims gordie ) , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg , `macho man' randy savage and sting ( among others ) . \\nwcw fans are sure to appreciate these . \\nothers . . . \\nwell , won't . \\ni found merit in david arquette's bountiful energy as gordie , which brings me to my finishing . . . . \\nahhh . . . .

life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving , down-to-earth wife annie ( kelly lynch ) . \\neverything dull , but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they\\'re on their boat . \\nthe plane nosedives into the water and sinks , but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt . \\nwhat they don\\'t realise is that the plane\\'s pilot was also a drug dealer , and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter\\'s erstwhile colleagues . \\nwhen robicheaux discovers this , he predictably , against the advice of his wife , a well-meaning dea agent , and two gangsters who rough him up , begins \\'poking his nose where it don\\'t belong\\' , we know that the man deserves all the misery he\\'s going to get . \\nthe question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious , meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide . \\nas dave robicheaux , alec baldwin is fat . . . \\nno seriously , this is not the svelte , thinking man\\'s hero of the hunt for red october , it is an out-of-shape guy who doesn\\'t look too good in a roof-top chasing scene . \\nhe\\'s also unconvincing in the movie\\'s dramatic moments , acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segal-like economy of expression . \\nthree-quarters of the way through the show , while you\\'re probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle , getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up , you\\'ll want to beat on him a little yourself . \\non the other hand , mary stuart masterson ( some kind of wonderful , fried green tomatoes , benny & joon ) cast as a down-and-out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air , with just the right mix of cynicism , warmth , insecurity and humour to be the movie\\'s only endearing character . \\neric roberts as bubba rocque , always believable as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box ( see final analysis , coincidentally also directed by phil joanou ) is believable here as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box . \\nand lest we forget teri hatcher\\'s role in all this , this being her rather well-publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv\\'s \" adventures of lois & clark \" . . . \\nshe is totally ridiculous as rocque\\'s manipulative and seductive cajun wife , coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who\\'s trying to get back at an employer who hasn\\'t been giving her enough days off . \\nit\\'s probably safe to say that her day job beckons . \\nand at

and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color . \\nhighlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park , garth\\'s seduction by a married woman , a surprise appearance by charleton heston , a 1960\\'s batman setup in the guy\\'s pad , and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some \" naked indian guy , \" an unexpected

there\\'s always boxes of watermelons , chickens , and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets , you\\'ll find out here . \\nthis movie also explores wayne and garth a little more .

negative about this film . \\nno one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story . \\nhowever , even if one thinks of it as fiction , \" the prince of egypt \" remains shallow . \\nbut i\\'ll begin from the beginning . \\nthe biggest difference between the original , biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible , whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero . \\nmaybe it\\'s just me , but if i knew i had god on my side , i\\'d have a little bit more confidence . \\nthere are other differences as well , such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah\\'s death like it\\'s nothing but a thing . \\nmost of all , though , the story\\'s focus has shifted . \\nrather than being a story about father-son , man-ethnicity , man-god , \" the prince of egypt \" is almost solely about the brother-brother relationship between rameses and moses . \\ni was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie , where it came off as maudlin . \\nrameses and moses squabble like children and then , in the interests

, never happened in the original story - moses was exiled ) . \\nbut enough about the differences . \\nlet\\'s talk about the movie itself . \\nit features a moses who , in the interests of making the character more human , lacks any divinity whatsoever , which isn\\'t convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is . \\nit features a cookie-cutter \" i-wanna-please-dada \" rameses , who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes ( from schindler\\'s list , among other things ) . \\nthe film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the \" new-improved \" miriam , voiced by the ever-antsy sandra bullock , even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason ( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice ) . \\nspeaking of which , it contains * very * annoying music . \\nit contains shallow writing . \\nit features extraordinary animation , which is one good thing i can say about this film . \\nmost of all , it contains an attempt to commercialize , homogenize , and mass-market a story about a manifestation of god . \\ni am not christian , but i got the impression of blasphemy . \\nthe writers and producers took a butcher knife and chop-chopped into the story . \\n',\n"," b'over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind\\'s nuclear testing . \\npartly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . \\na year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . \\nas godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . \\nthirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . \\nnow it\\'s 14 years after toho\\'s remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . \\nin emmerich\\'s godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . \\nwhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . \\nmeanwhile , tatopoulos\\'s college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . \\nshe\\'d like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . \\nof course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor \" animal \" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey\\'s trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . \\ntogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . \\nwith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation\\'s premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . \\nhe didn\\'t . \\nright up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . \\nthe plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it\\'s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . \\nthe script , however , is painfully bad . \\nit\\'s fraught with lines so corny , they don\\'t even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , \" you idiot , \" or \" you stupid girl . \" \\ni suppose when you\\'ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . \\nwhy is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? \\nwhy do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? \\nwhy do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? \\nwhy is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? \\nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . \\nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he\\'s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . \\nhank azaria does what he can , but don\\'t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . \\nlike broderick\\'s , azaria\\'s character is quite simply lacking in color . \\nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . \\ncasting must have been asleep on this one . \\nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we\\'ve seem him do in the past . \\nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . \\nunfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . \\nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . \\nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . \\nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . \\nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? \\nif we can\\'t take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don\\'t care what happens to them . \\ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . \\nfar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here\\'s a behemoth running through the city ! \\nthere\\'s bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . \\njoe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm\\'s way just in time . \\nin a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . \\nnone of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . \\nit\\'s as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . \\nconsider another punch pulled . \\nthrough creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn\\'t just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . \\nit made me want to gag . \\nemmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . \\nwith an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . \\nhowever , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn\\'t work . \\nnow if they only had raymond burr . . . . \\n',\n"," b'gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the film\\'s end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic , going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone . . . this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer . \\nnobody can save this bomb from it\\'s own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious-type of film . \\nit\\'s just a pile of dreck .

one-dimensional star who is past his prime . . . which \\nmakes this film dumber than dumb , plus it\\'s not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining . \\nit\\'s just dreary and unwatchable . . . a \\nbig-budget slasher film . \\narnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan ( occupying gabriel byrne\\'s body and possessing a wall st . bank account ) from destroying the world . \\nthe film opens in vatican city , roma 1979 -- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso , looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by , who proclaims after looking at his scrolls -- that\\'s the sign for the \\'eye of god , \\' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan\\'s baby ( the anti-christ ) in the hour before the new century begins , when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth . \\ntomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom . \\nbut some in the pope\\'s circle want to kill her if found , even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live , as he lectures them : \" even in the world\\'s darkest days -- doing evil doesn\\'t stop evil , but brings on more evil . \" \\nwe saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the \\'logical\\' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries . \\nthe chosen woman is christine york ( robin ) . \\nit is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise-cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot . \\nhe , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an \\'end of days\\' is coming as prophesized in revelations . \\nbut satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of \\'the end of the world\\' on his body . \\nit is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman . \\nhe quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold\\'s partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at . . . resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing , as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it . \\nthere is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs -- including the subway , churches , and luxury buildings . \\nthe only trouble with all these high-budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value . \\nthe story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility . \\nmercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 . \\nwhy is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil\\'s number \" 666 , \\'\\' well ! \\n . . . \\nsatan\\'s numeral is actually \" 999 , \\'\\' which is upside down of \" 666 . \\'\\' \\naccordingly , you just put a \" 1\\'\\' in front of it-- and bingo -- you get \" 1999 . \\'\\' \\nwith logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer\\'s eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult . \\nthis film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film . \\ni highly recommend seeing it for that purpose . \\n',\n"," b\"the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun

and more outrageous than that last film . \\nwhat the film is not , however , is funny . \\nthe plot centers around the return of dr . evil , who goes back in time to steal austin powers' mojo ( a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin's pelvis ) which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies . \\naustin must go after him , and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday . \\ni almost avoided this film because i did not like the original . \\nbut the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews . \\ni wish i had stuck to my first impression . \\nmyers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation . \\nand he has the talent to do it , at least as an actor . \\nbut the material he is working with here , much of it his own , falls short of anything resembling comic genius . \\nthis movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces , a five-hundred-pound fat man's butt crack , and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old . \\nafter some of these scenes , one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention . \\nthe direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor . \\nfor the most part , i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show . \\nthere is no sense of comic timing or subtlety . \\nthe director just throws the material at us , giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director . \\ni am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd , at least the one's who have yet to discover literacy . \\ncertainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as 'in your face , kick you in the teeth , take no prisoners , ( action-verb +blah blah blah ) .

have ever taken place in movie theaters . \\nyou won\\'t find any of them here . \\nthe old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit . \\nbilko ( and the name isn\\'t

some of today\\x12s movies or novels , you must \\x13suspend disbelief . \\x14 \\nhowever , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . \\nit came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . \\neven if you can ignore these somewhat \\x13white\\x14 lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain\\x12s plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don\\x12t gel . \\nfirstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . \\nhe _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . \\nas a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . \\ni say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . \\nbut nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . \\nwith a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn\\x12t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . \\njim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . \\nbut of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . \\nthe local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars . \\ndirector mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite \\x13goodies versus baddies , \\x14 there are numerous twists in it\\x12s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . \\nbut by the time these interesting changes occur , it\\x12s far too late in the film for them to have much affect . \\nhard rain\\x12s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although it\\x12s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . \\nnot at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . \\nsuch titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . \\nstrangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . \\nwe can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . \\nif you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . \\ni now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you don\\x12t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . \\nalthough hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . \\nthe addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can\\x12t handle anything else . \\ndespite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . \\nno creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesn\\x12t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films . \\n\",\n"," b\"the real blonde ( r ) a woman's face , an arm , some pumped-up pectorals , blond hair , a man's sad face , slender legs , a random hand here and

clinging to a nurturing woman , his head concealing her unclothed breasts . \\nif only the rest of this formless , aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently . \\njoe ( matthew modine ) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas . \\nhe's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live-in love , mary ( catherine keener ) , who holds

little mermaid . \\nthe bottle blonde has a turbulent on-again , off-again relationship with bob ( maxwell caulfield ) , a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde , which he finds in co-star kelly ( daryl hannah ) . \\nas the film unspools , a variety of other characters pass through : fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) ; mary's shrink ( buck henry ) and self-defense instructor ( denis leary ) ; joe's casting agent ( kathleen turner ) and hardass boss ( christopher lloyd ) ; and a mystery woman ( elizabeth berkley ) who keeps on crossing joe's path . \\nwhere exactly does all this go ? \\nthat's a question best posed to writer-director dicillo , who doesn't appear to have the slightest clue himself . \\nhis meandering , largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers , turning into dead-end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac . \\nand another . \\nand another . \\nat one point bob , frustrated with the soap scripts , complains to the head writer ( jim fyfe ) that his and kelly's characters keep on going in circles , with no hint of development or growth . \\nthat is most certainly the case here . \\njoe gets a job and ultimately botches things ; he and mary bicker ; they make up , only to have the pattern repeat itself . \\nunhappy with his bottle blonde , bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied ; he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied . \\nif there is a point to all of this , dicillo dances around it , spending his time on apparent digressions that , as it turns out , aren't digressions at all . \\nthe real blonde is not without some amusements . \\nit does have the occasional funny line and situation ; leary , henry , lloyd , steve buscemi , and dave chappelle shine in their small roles ; keener is a likable , refreshingly earthy lead ; berkley's appearance is mercifully brief ( she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute role ) ; and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket ( last year , the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months--due to lack of viewer interest ) . \\nbut on the whole , the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be glossy on the surface , but there's nothing going on inside . \\n ( opens february 27 ) \\n\",\n"," b'synopsis : valerie , a high school junior who doesn\\'t look a day under 22 , writes bad poetry , complains about how much she hates school , fantasizes about a young guy on trial for raping and murdering six women , chooses him as a pen pal , and plays hooky to see him in court . \\nafter a jailbreak , the killer puts on big sunglasses , wears a half-buttoned jacket , and uses his fatal charm to go after valerie . \\ncomments : \" alan smithee \" directed fatal charm , which should have been more appropriately titled \" fatal bore \" or \" fatal crap \" . \\nif you find out that a film you\\'re about to see is directed by \" alan smithee , \" then you should seriously , seriously , seriously consider watching something , anything , else . \\n \" alan smithee \" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad . \\nfrankly , i\\'d be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the \" alan smithee \" moniker for this film . \\nwhere to begin with this painfully poor thriller ? \\nlet\\'s start with the acting . \\nit\\'s pretty bad . \\namanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don\\'t ) , even though her performance isn\\'t exactly stellar material . \\nshe\\'s also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete . \\nher scenes with valerie\\'s mother , played by mary frann , are a joke . \\nthe two look as though they\\'re a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn\\'t understand . \\nchristopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm . \\ntrying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket . \\nif disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn\\'t cut it here . \\nearly on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom . \\noutside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film . \\nthey constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever . \\nfatal charm\\'s storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills . \\nthe script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with . \\nthis suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault . \\neven for the idiots who didn\\'t consider the movie\\'s title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up . \\nso , the audience must wait ( if they haven\\'t already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale . \\nthe video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an \" erotic thriller \" . \\na thriller it isn\\'t , and neither is it particularly erotic . \\ni can\\'t imagine , if someone were in the mood for something \" erotic , \" that he\\'d be happy after watching this fluff . \\na few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they\\'re supposed to be valerie\\'s fantasies -- how creative ) . \\non a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through . \\nit\\'s no wonder why she hated high school so much . \\nas an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student\\'s bad poetry ( of course , it\\'s valerie\\'s ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem\\'s inspiration . \\ni guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students . \\nfatal charm won\\'t charm anyone , unless there\\'s someone that\\'s charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers . \\nif you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on . \\n',\n"," b'if you\\'re going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ? \\nif you\\'re going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ? \\nwhile watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people . \\nwhat he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation . \\ncelebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he\\'s familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows . \\nallen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more . \\nbranagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery . \\nthe usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another . \\nunless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it\\'s not likely that you\\'ll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity . \\naside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless . \\nbranagh proves once again that he\\'s a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly . \\nthe problem is that he\\'s the same character allen always plays , a character who\\'s getting more than a little dull to watch . \\ni mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ? \\n-- he hates his work , and he can\\'t be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved . \\nhe brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he\\'s receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it\\'s pretty hard to care about him . \\nin addition , isn\\'t allen capable of creating characters who aren\\'t just like him ? \\ni know he is , but he didn\\'t do it in celebrity . \\nthe vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances . \\ndavis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie . \\nsome of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they\\'re not likable people . \\nonly famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon\\'s new novel , has any life . \\nthe men in the picture don\\'t do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging . \\nwhat\\'s really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its \" themes \" are . \\nallen seems to think that he\\'s making an insightful movie about the way \" normal \" people look at celebrities . \\nthe main problem with this is that the character with whom we\\'re supposed to identify , simon , is not a \" normal \" guy -- he\\'s just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters . \\nthe other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue . \\nin addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , \" it\\'s interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! \" ) . \\ncelebrity is arguably allen\\'s biggest misfire to date . \\nit does have a few good scenes -- theron\\'s super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two . \\nbut celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen\\'s point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends . \\nif he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that . \\ni , for one , don\\'t enjoy feeling like an outsider . \\n',\n"," b'since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they\\'re portraying , it\\'s fitting to say that \" beloved \" come as a real shock as a film . \\nit\\'s confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i\\'ve seen all year , and that\\'s not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . \\n \" beloved \" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , \" beloved \" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . \\n \" beloved \" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . \\nwhen the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . \\nsethe is proud , though , and will not move . \\nher sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . \\na couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . \\nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . \\nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies \" it ain\\'t evil . \\nit\\'s just sad . \" \\nsome more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . \\nbut when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . \\nher name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . \\nshe stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . \\nthey let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . \\n \" beloved \" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . \\nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . \\nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , \" they took my milk ! \" \\nworst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . \\nshe runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don\\'t leave them alone . \\nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn\\'t regret it . \\nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . \\nof course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren\\'t flat out told that until later on in the film . \\nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . \\nthus , \" beloved \" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , \" solaris , \" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . \\nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . \\n \" beloved \" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . \\nthe most interesting films are the ones that don\\'t explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . \\nsethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she\\'s being played by oprah winfrey . \\nit\\'s been well over a decade since her last major performance in \" the color purple , \" but judging from these two films , i\\'ll bet she\\'s one of the best actresses working today . . . if \\nshe was strictly an actress . \\nher talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that\\'s a shame because she brings so much to this movie . \\nemotion . \\nsadness . \\nstrength . \\nwatching the strong sethe , who\\'s so afraid of the past that she\\'s built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . \\nshe makes it real . \\nthat\\'s not to say this is a perfect film . \\nin fact , i\\'d wager to say that the fact that it\\'s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . \\nwhile oprah\\'s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i\\'m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn\\'t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . \\nit doesn\\'t necessarily move as though they\\'re memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \\nbut despite its tediousness , perhaps that\\'s the point . \\nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \\nand for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . \\njonathan demme\\'s direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . \\nthere\\'s more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . \\nthe acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . \\neveryone has been raving about thandie newton\\'s performance , and how it should be rewarded . \\nhowever , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . \\nact like a baby . \\nthrow things . \\nstumble around . \\nchew food with your mouth open . \\ni do think there\\'s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it\\'s kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother\\'s loss of reality towards the end . \\nit\\'s not that newton isn\\'t great : she\\'s as annoying and wacky as the role demands . \\nit\\'s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . \\ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , \" beloved \" has still not done well . \\ncosting , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . \\nunfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic \" caligula , \" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . \\nalthough i respect \" beloved , \" i can\\'t say that i really enjoyed it . \\n',\n"," b'lauded as a genius by many , stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such critically-acclaimed films as \" 2001 : a space odyssey , \" \" a clockwork orange , \" \" lolita , \" and \" dr . \\nstrangelove , or : how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb . \" \\nnow , sadly , he\\'s added \" eyes wide shut \" to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near-flawless copybook . \\nkubrick , alas , should have quit while he was ahead . \\nthis much-publicized psycho-sexual tease-a-thon , with its star billing of real-life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman , is nothing more than one long ( two-and-a-half hours long ) boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut . \\nkubrick , faithless to arthur schnitzler\\'s 1926 novella \" dream story , \" has confused eroticism with nudity . \\nhe has confused intellectualism with talking slowly . \\nhe has confused profundity with pretentiousness . \\nin addition , the director has made some strange casting choices , leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out . \\npollack , the director of such box-office hits as \" tootsie \" and \" out of africa , \" is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he\\'s miserably out of his depth . . . \\nand there isn\\'t much depth to begin with ! \\nunhappily , there\\'s not likely to be a director\\'s cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one . \\nin fact , with the exception of the stark black-and-white credits , snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack , and many , many grainy tracking shots down lavishly-decorated corridors , there\\'s none of kubrick\\'s trademark brilliance in this film . \\nit doesn\\'t help that the story , as delivered , is ridiculous . \\ncruise and kidman , who bring little more than marital torpor to the project , play well-to-do new yorkers bill and alice harford . \\nhe\\'s a doctor and she\\'s an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address . \\nat an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler ( pollack ) , alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a jeremy irons-like hungarian , who\\'s singularly determined to get her in the sack . \\nbill , too , is seen arm-in-arm with a couple of models before he\\'s pulled away to deal with an overdoser . \\nback home , bill and alice smoke a little pot before alice\\'s aggressive jealousy kicks in . \\nas retribution , she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed . \\nthis hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin ; he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with black-and-white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman . \\nit\\'s all way too much for him . \\nfor revenge , bill almost has sex with a hooker . \\nhe almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store . \\nthen he almost does the hooker\\'s roommate . \\nand he\\'s almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious , password-protected party where everyone wears masks and \" the women are incredible \" ( i . e . , naked ) . \\nthis \" erotic \" set piece , a cult-ish bacchanal complete with chanting , incense , and lots of strategically-placed partygoers covering up the dirty , might impress the likes of hugh hefner , but it\\'s a lot less shocking than it\\'s intended to be . \\nwhat\\'s the big deal ? \\nbill doesn\\'t exactly * do * anything ( other than throw his money and credentials around ) , and alice only ever lusted in her heart . \\nwhoop-dee-doo . \\nstill , they make up at the same agonizingly slow pace--was kubrick , notorious for multiple takes , paying them at an hourly rate ? \\neven geniuses have their bad days . \\n \" eyes wide shut \" just happens to be kubrick\\'s bad day , an unerotic , disappointing , and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career . \\n',\n"," b'dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it . \\nalthough dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one \" dead bore . \" \\nin the film , johnson plays . . . \\nyou guessed it . . . \\na cop . \\nthe role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on \" miami vice . \" \\na la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life . \\nbeck\\'s wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children . \\nshe will not even allow him to wish them \" merry christmas \" by telephone . \\nbut beck\\'s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang . \\nbeck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop . \\nhis investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp . \\nvirtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective . \\nthe plot is incoherent and full of holes . \\nthe movie depicts beck\\'s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions . \\nthe action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense . \\ni certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii . \\nin all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang\\'s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction . \\ndead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting . \\naccording to the movie\\'s production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck . \\nyou would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable . \\nmost of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above . \\nwilliam forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who\\'s offended by beck\\'s foul language and unorthodox methods . \\nforsythe\\'s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable . \\ndead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( \" wkrp in cincinnati \" and \" frank\\'s place \" ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains . \\nthe sole function of penelope ann miller\\'s character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less . \\ni guess the film\\'s title refers to this love scene since it\\'s definitely a dead bang . \\nthe only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie\\'s pitiful script . \\njohnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life . \\nand i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments . \\nthe funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him . \\nbut when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie\\'s in trouble . \\nthe other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can\\'t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen . \\nbut two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make . \\n',\n"," b\"waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : `after all , we're human . ' \\nin the context of events to transpire , joe's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film . \\ndoes being human necessarily imply humane behavior ? \\nthrough the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility . \\nexpressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria . \\nin the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar . \\ndeputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip . \\nwe see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar . \\nwhat is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse . \\nwhat once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless . \\nto the audience , the deputy's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob's delirium crescendos . \\nlang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness . \\nthe shot's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions . \\nas the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well . \\nthe stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality . \\nbecause the camera does not track the deputy's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability . \\nas the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob . \\nthis shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject . \\nwhile a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob's belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large . \\nwe see close shots of people's faces , contorted by their rage . \\nwith the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching . \\nin this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail . \\nin some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind . \\nlang's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior . \\nas joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side . \\nlang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts . \\nusing his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man's volatility and `impulse' towards inconceivable cruelty . \\nreprising joe' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity . \\n\",\n"," b'the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing . \\nhowever , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . \\nand , considering the quality of species 2 , it\\'s obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . \\nthe only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . \\nif you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience . \\nof course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn\\'t be able to get into an \" r \" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies . \\nthere\\'s enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring . \\nthis is a grade z exploitation flick that\\'s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment . \\nsomewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as \" erotic . \" \\ni would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism . \\nsure , there\\'s a lot of sex and nudity , but it\\'s almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman\\'s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions . \\nanyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater . \\ni suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) . \\nalthough the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone . \\nthis creature , dubbed \" eve \" by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile . \\nmeanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars . \\na team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them . \\nross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he\\'s soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session . \\nhis intention is obviously world domination . \\nstanding in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick\\'s fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) . \\nbut when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there\\'s no damping his ardor . \\ni\\'m not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . \\nmichael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run . \\nditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick\\'s father -- \" underused \" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( \" invisible \" would be more like it ) . \\ngeorge dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general . \\nmeanwhile , justin lazard\\'s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge\\'s limited abilities look good by comparison . \\nthe only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick . \\ncomplete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics . \\ndirector peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness . \\ndo i recommend the movie ? \\nabsolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn\\'t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . \\nhere\\'s hoping there\\'s no species 3 . \\n',\n"," b' \" i know what you did last summer , \" the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996\\'s \" scream , \" and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997\\'s biggest hit of the fall season . \\nwhile \" scream \" was a more knowing film about the genre , \" i know what you did last summer \" is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the \" friday the 13th \" films ( well , okay , \" jason goes to hell \" was pure hell to sit through ) . \\nthe film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c . \\nit is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways . \\nkind-hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player . \\nwhen the four of them travel to a nearby mountain-side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home . \\ndistraught and confused , they decide they can\\'t go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter , so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him . \\njulie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry . \\nswitch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out . \\nalmost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , \" i know what you did last summer , \" and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook . \\n \" i know what you did last summer , \" is a successful horror film for a number of reasons . \\nthe cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings . \\nthe characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort . \\nand last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i\\'ve seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family\\'s store with the killer inside with her . \\nperhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit . \\nheche\\'s performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time . \\n \" i know what you did last summer , \" could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems . \\nprinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth . \\nalso , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines . \\nluckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted \" jump-in-your-seat \" scare . \\nin the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i\\'ve ever heard . \\nshe honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best \" scream queen . \" \\nand gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered . \\nalthough not up to the level of either \" scream \" movies , or the more recent , \" urban legend , \" \" i know what you did last summer \" is a respectable , smartly-scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made . \\n',\n"," b'i swear i have seen the edge before . \\nin fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . \\nhowever , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . \\nin doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . \\nunfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . \\nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . \\none surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . \\naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . \\neven horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . \\nthe river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . \\nthe intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . \\nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . \\ni must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . \\nthis is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . \\nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes\\' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . \\nthe edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . \\nbut taking scream\\'s lead , the edge makes fun of the genre\\'s cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . \\ncharles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . \\nfor once , we don\\'t immediately care for the main character . \\ninstead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles\\' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . \\nthey board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . \\ncharles\\' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . \\nas action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . \\nsoon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his \" personality . \" \\ncharles , bob , bob\\'s assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . \\ndown the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . \\ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . \\nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . \\ntake , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . \\nthis has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . \\nbut given the charles\\' intelligence , and bob\\'s uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . \\neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . \\nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles : \" most people die in the wilderness because they didn\\'t do the one thing that could save their life . . . \\nthinking . \" \\ndespite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn\\'t as it seems anymore . \\ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . \\nthe first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles\\' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . \\ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . \\ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . \\nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? \\ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . \\nthankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . \\nbut some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . \\nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . \\nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . \\nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences\\' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . \\nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . \\nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . \\nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . \\nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . \\nshe isn\\'t in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . \\nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . \\nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . \\nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . \\nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . \\nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . \\ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . \\ndavid mamet\\'s script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . \\nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn\\'t end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . \\nit\\'s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . \\nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . \\nway to go , bart . \\n',\n"," b'the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities . \\nthe best tales of the genre deal with mankind\\'s struggle for survival or knowledge . \\nsuch popular and noteworthy tomes as \" stranger in a strange land \" by robert heinlein , \" childhood\\'s end \" by arthur c . clarke and \" man in the high castle \" and \" do androids dream of electric sheep \" by philip k . dick all deal with man\\'s need for identity and struggle for self worth . \\nhollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it\\'s beginnings . \\nmost films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved . \\nit really wasn\\'t until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein\\'s novel \" rocketship galileo \" and crafted the film \" destination moon \" , that \\'sci-fi\\' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it\\'s own . \\nfrom there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre . \\nwith the release of touchstone pictures \" mission to mars \" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe . \\nthe film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o\\'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission . \\nwoody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son . \\nentering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) . \\nluc consoles jim with woody\\'s assistance . \\nthe three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them . \\nbut jim still longs to set foot on the red planet . \\nthe mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars . \\nthey send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface . \\ngoing out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed \\'face on mars\\' . \\na strange noise emanates from the rock . \\nas the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc . \\nback on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing . \\nluc\\'s interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team . \\nthe second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger . \\nmeteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet\\'s surface . \\nthe big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars . \\nand if so , what is its relationship with us ? \\nnow for the bad news . \\nthe entire plot of \" mission to mars \" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe . \\nthe famed \\'face on mars\\' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed . \\nborrowing ideas from such films as \" robinson crusoe on mars \" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" , and even mario bava\\'s \" planet of the vampires \" ( \\'terrore nello spazio\\' ) ( 1965 ) , \" mission to mars \" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don\\'t add up to a satisfying whole . \\nwhile some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving . \\nso much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use . \\nthe performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry . \\ngary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation . \\nand the mistaken idea of having jerry o\\'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse . \\nand the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better . \\nhe\\'s just having too much fun here to give a damn . \\nthe script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage . \\nthis of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship . \\nalso , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation . \\nbut the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone . \\nsubtlety is non-existent here . \\nin fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out . \\nthe only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower . \\nthe pacing of the film is very leisurely . \\nafter the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface . \\nthen , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity . \\nthe film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum . \\nthere are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop . \\nthe good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at . \\nthe vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring . \\nthe design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn\\'t been seen since \" 2001 : a space odyssey \" . \\nthe visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth . \\nthe only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world . \\ndirector de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film . \\nthe opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage\\' to hitchcock\\'s \" rope \" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters . \\nscenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution . \\nbut the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang . \\nsadly it is not . \\ndirector brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production . \\nthe set design and visual effects are all arresting . \\nbut it\\'s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction . \\na disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals . \\n',\n"," b'synopsis : a novelist struggling with his latest work buys a weird brain with a protruding eyeball encased in a jar . \\nthe brain exerts its evil influence upon the novelist and his secretary , while his wife disapproves . \\nmeanwhile , a loan shark in need of a shave tries to leave his profession . \\ncomments : why is this movie called possessed by the night ? \\nit\\'s hard to speculate . \\nmost of this film takes place during the day , and the only thing possessing anyone is an icky , pulsating , bubbling brain thingie in a jar . \\nin case you haven\\'t picked up on this yet , possessed by the night is a bottom-of-the-barrel \" thriller \" ( i use the term \" thriller \" loosely here ) which is really cheap and bad . \\nthe plot , which sounds like a cheesy pulp science fiction story from the 1950s , actually serves one purpose : to exploit nude women as often as possible . \\nwriting a movie review for a film like this proves oddly challenging . \\nthere\\'s really not much to say . \\nthe acting is lousy ; although , occasionally , the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience . \\nmost humorous is frank sivero , who plays murray , the novelist\\'s agent . \\nhe is so horrible in this role that one can\\'t help but be amused . \\nthe plot sucks . \\nnearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out of the profession , even though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole . \\nthe dialogue stinks . \\na loan shark , for instance , tells another how much he loves bimbos , which is something the audience really doesn\\'t need to know . \\neverything about possessed by the night is second rate , even the film credits . \\nas the names of the not-so-talented film crew scrolled by at the end , joseph scales came up , credited as being \" assistsant to foley artist . \" \\nsomeone could have used an editor ! \\nto be honest , the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity and show some sex scenes . \\nplayboy playmate shannon tweed , after all , is the star here . \\ni suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing , he would like this movie . \\nwhy did i give this turkey two stars and not one ? \\nas a bad movie , it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in the film . \\nif you feel possessed to see possessed by the night , however , i\\'d recommend you exorcise this impulse and watch something else . \\n',\n"," b'remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ? \\n \" pulp fiction \" and \" fargo \" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter . \\nthat fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing \" the way of the gun \" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be\\'s but upon closer inspection doesn\\'t look like anything comprehendable . \\nit\\'s a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won\\'t allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . \\ncomplexity should come as no surprise to anyone who\\'s familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote \" the usual suspects , \" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . \\nthat film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . \\nyou have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that \" if it\\'s really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . \" \\nwith \" the way of the gun \" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . \\nthe film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren\\'t hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) . \\nthey get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . \\nthey figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . \\nalong the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the \" bag man \" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he\\'s doing ) . \\nthe exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can\\'t call the authorities for help . \\nhis goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers\\' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . \\nthe exec\\'s son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . \\nmeanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . \\nmcquarrie doesn\\'t know the meaning of the word simple . \\nhe seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . \\neverything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it\\'s to the point of surrealism . \\nnothing is what it seems in this reality , it\\'s one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry\\'s rules and regulations . \\nevery scene with caan\\'s character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about \" the business \" and how it works and we\\'re hardly given a clue as to what they\\'re talking about . \\nthese characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they\\'re more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet\\'s trash . \\nno one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality . \\nit\\'s like a dream without any appeal . \\ntake the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . \\nthey sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don\\'t move . \\nthe guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . \\nyou\\'d think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don\\'t , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob . \\nthere\\'s a lot of things i didn\\'t understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn\\'t some yuppie or old rich snob , he\\'s like a hippie straight out of the 60s . \\nsecondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . \\nlastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country\\'s army . \\nif they were suicidal they wouldn\\'t have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . \\nthere\\'s a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . \\nwhat it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . \\nabsolutely none of the characters are likable or believable . \\nand it\\'s all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . \\nwith any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it . \\ni can\\'t say either for \" the way of the gun , \" because it has very little going for it and i can\\'t imagine anyone intelligently defending it . \\n',\n"," b'i don\\'t expect much from eddie murphy these days . \\nfor the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . \\nsuch films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . \\nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . \\nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . \\nsherman has just invented a new \" youth drink \" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . \\njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . \\nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . \\nwith some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the \" buddy love \" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . \\nbut one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . \\nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . \\nthen the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . \\nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? \\nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . \\npure and simple , the klumps is a failure . \\nits script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . \\nany sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . \\nit\\'s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . \\nhey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . \\nthe characterization of sherman\\'s family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . \\neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . \\nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . \\nthe father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . \\nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . \\nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . \\nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . \\nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . \\nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . \\nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldn\\'t act like this all the time . \\nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . \\nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . \\nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . \\neven the best effects can\\'t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . \\nnow that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . \\npeople will be lined up around the block for it . \\nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . \\neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he\\'ll play every character in the movie . \\ni just can\\'t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . \\n',\n"," b'the ads for \" batman and robin \" scream \" the event of the summer is here \" and that\\'s the problem . \\nthe producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . \\n \" batman and robin \" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . \\nit\\'s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . \\nit wasn\\'t always this way . \\ntim burton\\'s \" batman \" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . \\nthe film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . \\nbatman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . \\nthe joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . \\nbatman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city\\'s breathtaking gothic skyline . \\nthose days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . \\n \" batman and robin \" has far more in common with the campy 60\\'s batman tv show than with tim burton\\'s tale of darkness . \\nthe blame lies with director joel schumacher . \\na former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . \\nunfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn\\'t the faintest notion of what to do . \\n \" batman and robin \" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it\\'s often difficult to tell who\\'s whacking who . \\nwhile the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . \\na few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . \\n \" batman and robin \" doesn\\'t merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . \\nit\\'s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . \\nironically , the parts of \" batman and robin \" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . \\neasily the best batman yet , clooney\\'s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn\\'t even hint at . \\nthe film\\'s most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne\\'s butler and surrogate father . \\nas for the other heroes , chris o\\'donnell\\'s robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . \\nin a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne\\'s girlfriend is puzzling . \\ni suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . \\nof course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that\\'s where \" batman and robin \" really suffers . \\nas mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . \\nlaboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he\\'s having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . \\numa thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . \\nshe overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it\\'s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . \\nonce thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . \\nthurman fails to maintain the character\\'s maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . \\nthe biggest lesson to be learned from \" batman and robin \" is that more is not better . \\njoel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . \\nsome critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . \\ni don\\'t think so . \\nmy prescription ? \\nfire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist\\'s convention so he\\'ll understand that there\\'s no hard feelings ) . \\ngive alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o\\'donnell and michael gough . \\ncall jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . \\nthen , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the \" event \" mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time . \\n',\n"," b\"kevin smith is like a big kid . \\nhis humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's . \\nhe grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few . \\nhe also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups . \\nsmith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong . \\nkevin smith is a better writer than director , and he'll be the first to tell you that . \\nthat might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed . \\ngreat directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them . \\nthis was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well . \\nthat is not to say smith's message is a bad one . \\nin dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god's desires is superior to anyone else's . \\nbasically , dogmatism is bad . \\nchanging the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not . \\nthis is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma's protesters are proving smith's point . \\nsmith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book . \\nbut this is smith's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns . \\nthe story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) . \\nalong the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany's aid . \\nfallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery . \\nthe logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum . \\namong the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men . \\nof course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself . \\nthey are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic . \\nsmith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie . \\nwhen harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke . \\nthe film's humor is uneven . \\nsome parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance . \\nbut many of the film's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek's serendipity . \\nalso , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away . \\nstill , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace . \\namong the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far . \\nfiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight . \\ndamon and affleck are fairly lackluster . \\nrock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith . \\nbut the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith's movies , are much more in line with smith's brand of humor . \\nbud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances . \\n\",\n"," b'making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece . \\nwhen it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure . \\nfor a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original\\'s greatness is very rare indeed . \\nand whereas \" babe : pig in the city \" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece . \\nmore than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like \" the godfather : part ii \" and \" the empire strikes back \" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" picks up precisely where \" babe \" left off . \\nhaving won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his

where so many sequels fail . \\nmost sequels simply rehash the events of the first film . \\nnot \" babe : pig in the city \" . \\nthis is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first . \\nalso , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy . \\nin essence , it doesn\\'t attempt to copy itself . \\ninstead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own . \\nand it succeeds . \\nthat\\'s not to say the familiar is absent . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film . \\nalong with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade\\'s best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) . \\nthe three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals . \\nthe story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice . \\nfrom there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne\\'s soothingly deep narrative . \\ncomposer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these . \\nbut these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting . \\nwhile staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals . \\nmonkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new \" urbanites \" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter . \\neach character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching . \\nand while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well . \\nmary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors . \\nstein\\'s landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature . \\nwe also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions . \\nnot having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was . \\nso as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won\\'t reveal the actor\\'s identity here . \\nit was a treat indeed to see one of cinema\\'s legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance . \\nthe greatest triumph of \" babe : pig in the city \" is the art direction . \\nsimply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level . \\nrestricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture . \\nbut the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world\\'s architectural landmarks . \\ndesigning a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) . \\nadded to that , many of this city\\'s streets are the twin siblings of venice\\'s gondola-trekked rivers . \\nthe metropolis that has sprung from ford\\'s vision is a wondrous sight to behold . \\nit is a world that you want to walk around in . \\nnorma moriceau\\'s costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford\\'s landscape . \\nmost of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom\\'s clown outfit . \\nandrew lesnie\\'s photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film\\'s multiple emotional tones . \\nmuch press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of \" babe : pig in the city \" . \\nreports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating . \\nthese reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating . \\nbut even so , to be anything harsher than the original\\' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms . \\nby deleting a minimal number of shots , \" babe : pig in the city \" was eventually given the coveted g rating . \\nalthough appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself . \\nwell , to coin a phrase , the reports of \" babe : pig in the city \" \\'s death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated . \\ngranted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all \" babe : pig in the city \" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be . \\nwhatever \" dark \" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the \" mad max \" trilogy , \" the witches of eastwick \" , \" lorenzo\\'s oil \" ) . \\nhaving served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director\\'s chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise . \\nthe story of \" babe : pig in the city \" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn\\'t achieve the emotional or character depth of the original . \\nmissing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual\\'s worth , challenging conformity , and one\\'s purpose in life . \\n \" babe \" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones . \\nthis film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on . \\nbut this film\\'s goals aren\\'t as lofty as the first\\'s , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe . \\nhoggett\\'s love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality . \\nbest exemplified in hoggett\\'s dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique . \\nit is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not . \\nplease understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se\\' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between \" babe : pig in the city \" being a very good film and the original being a great one . \\nbut having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best . \\nas an overall piece , \" babe : pig in the city \" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end . \\nsure , it isn\\'t a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness . \\nit is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema . \\nas a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year\\'s best cinematic treats . \\n',\n"," b'house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs , geoffrey rush , ali larter , famke janssen , peter gallagher , bridgette wilson , max perlich , lisa loeb , james marsters , and chris kattan . \\ndirected by william malone , written by dick beebe , \\n \" house on haunted hill \" initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible . \\none doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck . \\na nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water . \\nthese mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements . \\nexcept this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be . \\nin past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims . \\n \" house on haunted hill \" doesn\\'t want their audience to have an imagination , everything is provided for them to watch and squirm , not think . \\nthis nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film . \\n \" house on haunted hill \" , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest . \\nthe film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot . \\nthe aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem . \\nhowever , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable . \\nthe plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) . \\neach character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money . \\nsince the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them . \\nthe problem is that every character is not likable . \\nthe two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) . \\nthe characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them . \\nthe worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan\\'s watson pritchett . \\nhe spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate , that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself . \\nwaiting for pritchett to die , was a strenuously difficult act to sit through . \\nthe most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) . \\nplaying the rich man who supposedly organized the party , he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face . \\nhowever , rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price , played by famke janssen . \\nthe main problem is that \" house on haunted hill \" is not scary . \\nto top off that huge disappointment , every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous . \\nif the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to \" deep blue sea \" ) , the goal for creating a creepy , suspenseful action film was completely missed . \\n',\n"," b'some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others , almost as gifted , have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable . \\nas was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon . \\nrejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type . \\ngloria is her latest disaster . \\nbabe ruth didn\\'t quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best . \\njaneane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone\\'s part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn\\'t do garofalo\\'s comedic roles . \\ngloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn\\'t behind the picture . \\nafter seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press . \\nit is a film more to be endured than enjoyed . \\nas the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . \\nshe\\'s got a bad attitude and a big mouth . \\nshe also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . \\nan annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky . \\njust before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria\\'s ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky\\'s dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin\\'s operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . \\n \" be a man , \" his father lectures him sternly . \\n \" don\\'t trust nobody . \\nnot no broads . \\nnobody . \" \\nmost of the film\\'s leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time and temperature announcements . \\nadd in the movie\\'s almost non-existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones . \\nlumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting . \\nthey stand awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences that pass for discourse . \\n ( \" say you\\'re my baby , \" kevin coos demandingly . \\n \" i\\'m not gonna , \" gloria pouts back . ) \\nthe movie has a plethora of logical flaws and implausibilites . \\nthe kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared , no matter how many people are after him with guns , trying to kill him . \\nand in one key scene , the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it and is further assumed never to have been copied . \\ngloria , who keeps saying how she hates kids , takes nicky under her wing and protects him from kevin and the bad guys . \\nthink her maternal instincts will show up before the movie finally and predictably ends ? \\nif you don\\'t know the answer , you may be just the right viewer for this film . \\nyou have to say this for stone : she can keep a straight face . \\nwhen explaining life to a 7-year-old kid , she says with utter seriousness , \" you got a lot of love making to make ; you got a lot of boozing to do . \" \\ngloria runs 1 : 48 . \\nit is rated r for profanity , violence and brief male nudity and would be acceptable for teenagers . \\n',\n"," b'the kids in the hall are an acquired taste . \\nit took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer . \\nmaybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen . \\nmy recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film . \\nas it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv . \\na big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show . \\nthe kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so . \\nand this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics . \\nbrain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression . \\nin typical sketch-comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles . \\ndoctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug . \\nthen , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace . \\nthe ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film . \\nat about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long . \\nthe best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit . \\nbut with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough . \\nstrangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv . \\nthe movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating . \\none of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower . \\nin the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail . \\nthe kids , unfortunately , are not up to the task . \\nthere are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one . \\n',\n"," b' \" there\\'s nothing new under the sun \" is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means \" let\\'s find something to copy . \" \\nof course there are very few completely original ideas . \\neven earth-shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience . \\nthere is , after all , no need to re-invent the wheel time after time . \\nrecently it seems that hollywood doesn\\'t feel the need to even re-write the script . \\nmy understanding of the word \" sequel \" is a continuation of the story . \\nthe film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes . \\nhave an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma\\'s adaptation of the steven king novel ? \\nthis is your dream come true . \\nrachel ( emily bergl ) , a high school outcast , is beginning to notice weird things happening around her . \\ndoors slam shut by themselves . \\nglass globes blow up . \\nher mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent . \\na popular boy unexpectedly asks her out . \\nthe in-crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event . \\nany of this sound familiar ? \\nonce the audience catches on that this is the same story as \" carrie \" , there\\'s little to do but wait for the inevitable ending . \\nthe effects are a bit better this time around , but the film doesn\\'t work nearly as well . \\nthere are a couple of minor plot differences . \\nrachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized . \\nthe boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original . \\nthey keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest . \\nand , uh , there must be other story changes but none stand out . \\none nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell . \\nover 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie . \\nnow a high school counselor , she befriends rachel , but her character\\'s potential is squandered . \\nthere\\'s too much about sue that doesn\\'t make sense . \\nafter the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates , sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel\\'s mother is in . \\nstill living in the same small town , the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor ? \\nsue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease . \\nthis may be the one original idea in the film , but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a \" disease \" is never explained . \\nsue\\'s eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn\\'t figure out what to do with her . \\nblink and you\\'ll miss it . \\nsome of the events are filmed in black and white , but the rationale for this is unknown . \\nit doesn\\'t add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random . \\n \" the rage \" retains some of the trappings of \" carrie \" without the meaning . \\nin the first film the color red was a motif connected to carrie\\'s onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating . \\nhere there\\'s an abundance of red , but for no apparent purpose . \\nthe casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin . \\none might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds . \\nthe biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original . \\nseeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film - and the flaws in this one . \\n',\n"," b'a cop with a troubled personal life . \\na ruthless villain . \\na friend of the cop . \\na _dead_ friend of the cop . \\na quest for vengeance . \\na new partner . \\na romantic interest . \\na chase scene . \\na chase scene _in san francisco_ . \\na woman in peril . \\na confrontation . \\nan explosion . \\nthe end . \\nyawn . \\nyawn . \\nyawn . \\nthe preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films ; this one just happens to be called metro . \\ni have learned to expect little from films like metro , and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed . \\nwith eddie murphy on board , however , you hope for something extra , some kind of spark . \\nwhen a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience , you know it is doing something terribly wrong . \\nmurphy stars as scott roper , a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job . \\nwith his personal life , he is considerably less successful , facing an unhappy ex-girlfriend named veronica ( carmen ejogo ) , a gambling problem and a mountain of debt . \\nthen his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend and colleague ( art evans ) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda ( michael wincott ) . \\nfinding korda becomes very personal to scott , and he joins with new partner kevin mccall ( michael rappaport ) to foil korda during an attempted heist . \\nbut all is not well even with korda in jail , as scott , veronica and kevin all continue to face life-threatening danger . \\nmetro ( the title , in case you are wondering , means absolutely nothing ) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads . \\nin the first place , korda\\'s rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway ( and , incidentally , to screw it up ) . \\na reference to payoffs in the police department , followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case and a couple of pointed glances , is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty-five minutes ; even the relationship between scott and new partner kevin is so perfunctory , with kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet for scott , that you may yearn for bickering buddies . \\nworst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain ( the always menacing michael wincott ) behind bars for far too long , leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedious reconciliation of scott and veronica . \\nyou can\\'t blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady , but he should have known better than to take this role at all . \\nscott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between the kind of street-wise fast-talker murphy has built a career on and an actual three-dimensional character , and murphy is never able to reconcile the two . \\nthe script seems to have been doctored for him , with a gambling problem turned into a bit of character color and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags rather than actual conflict , yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with . \\nfor much of the film , he walks around with an intense frown , and it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time . \\nmurphy is stranded with too few solid punch lines , and nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo and fall to the ground limply . \\ni suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase ( how much do you want to bet on the likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill ? ) and doing a few interesting things with it . \\nas vehicles are sent flying and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car , it is possible at least for a moment to take some pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation . \\ncarter does an even better job by taking that old suspense stand-by -- the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone -- and using it to defuse tension not once , but _twice_ . \\nthe fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches , and a willingness to subvert them , makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling . \\nan action film like this plods so relentlessly and obviously from point a to point b to point c that you might find yourself shouting out \" point c ! \" while they\\'re still getting to point b , or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen . \\n',\n"," b'jean-claude van damme movies tend to be , if nothing else , a lot of mindless fun . \\nhis latest film , \" knock off , \" skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is , well , simply mindless . \\nyou can\\'t really blame van damme . \\nno one , i suspect , has ever expected \" the muscles from brussels \" to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray . \\nand even his sidekick co-star , \" saturday night live \" alumnus rob \" makin\\' copies \" schneider , does what\\'s expected of him , although neither appear to want the role of straight man . \\nno , the problem with the film is its direction . \\nthe first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible . . . \\nand it goes downhill from there ! \\nfive hundred characters , it seems , are introduced within the first fifteen minutes . \\nvan damme doesn\\'t land his first kick until after thirty--too late for most action fans--and by the time the hour mark has rolled around , your jaw will be on your cup holder and you\\'ll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess . \\ndirector hark tsui , whose previous film was the van damme/dennis rodman teamed \" double team , \" films at such a frenetic pace that it\\'s hard to know what\\'s going on , who\\'s on whose side , and what the point of all this is . \\nfaster than you can yell \" fruit stand ! \" \\nwe\\'re watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme . \\nwhen schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a four-foot eel while enthusing \" move your beautiful big ass , \" the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre . \\nevery now and again \" knock off \" will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes--inventive camera shots and angles , wild rides down gun silencers and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below , revealing cut-ins within the frame--but they all happen too quickly , and within such a furious frame of reference , that they\\'re wasted . \\nif only hark could have slowed things down just for a minute . \\nif you\\'re interested in the plot , you\\'re better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on-screen shenanigans : \" jean-claude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with \" nanobombs \" hidden in cabbage patch knock-offs . \\nmaybe . \\nwith paul sorvino . \" \\na more accurate summary would be \" jean-claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large , blatant coca-cola product placements . \" \\nthe fact that the film is staged during hong kong\\'s last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesn\\'t figure in at all . \\nperhaps \" knock off \" \\'s most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score . \\nsome of you might remember the mael brothers as the \\'80s synth pop duo sparks ; their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action-- \" kimono

the feeling if the police academy cadets had made a different career choice , this would be the result , except here you have such interesting characters as the \" token white guy \" ( busey ) who wants to get in tight with the blacks now before they take over the world , the token jive talker named tyrone ( charlie barnett ) who wears his hair in rollers and uses the word \" honkey \" as much as possible , the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chains ( mr . t -- a real stretch for him ) , the aspiring musician waiting for his big break ( maher ) , the mexican gigolo ( rodriguez ) , the woman who actually wants to drive cabs for a living ( warfield ) and the guy who wants to own a cab company for a living ( adam baldwin ) . \\nwe\\'ve all seen dozens of bad comedies from the 80\\'s .

after the day she follows him through the woods and hears him giving his graduation speech ( which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property and nearly killed dozens of people ) . \\nin the speech , kelley quotes a poem by robert frost , which just so happens to be sam\\'s favorite poem as well . \\nawwwww . \\nsoon they\\'re frolicking around in the fields and for some reason waste no time letting people in town ( especially jasper\\'s best friend ) see them together . \\nkelley continues to make an ass of himself in town , especially when he shows up at the

of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong , kelley is hands down the more unlikable of the two , simply because his jerkish actions are calculated . \\nhe intends to be a jackass each and every time he does it . \\njasper on the other hand , only reacts to kelley\\'s provocations , and afterwards comes across as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions . \\nbut , as in life , nice guys finish last . \\nfor the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the film\\'s only sympathetic character gets completely crushed . \\nthen , a cancer subplot comes into play ( where things get even more infuriating , if you can imagine that ) . \\nwhat , things weren\\'t depressing enough for you mr . screenwriter ? \\nwho greenlit this project ? \\nwho \" on

\\nwhoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes . \\nmaybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real . \\nthe animatronics

\\n\",\n"," b'in many ways , \" twotg \" does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories . \\nthere\\'s savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold . \\nbut , i suppose , we wouldn\\'t expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us \" the usual suspects \" . \\nhis writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry . \\nthe two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) . \\nthese two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough . \\ntheir troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive . \\ngiven the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they\\'ll always choose the latter . \\nyet , they are incredibly foolish planners . \\nactually , these two never really have a plan . \\nthey just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked . \\ntheir next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald\\'s burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family . \\nif all goes well , they\\'ll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on . \\nwhat parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss . \\nmoreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her . \\nthese two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations . \\nthey would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high . \\nbut it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways . \\nthe next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation . \\nduring this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed . \\nbecause the chidduck\\'s can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome . \\nwe discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause . \\nas a result , there are undercurrents of a conspiracy , and elements of betrayal and subterfuge . \\nthe sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings , shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur . \\nthe momentum and the coolness of the film , however , begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes , which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money . \\nyou can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement . \\nin fact , you may admire this film more than you like it . \\nyet , for the most part , \" the way of the gun \" stays on target . \\nit feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay , and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry . \\n',\n"," b'when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart , it could mean one of two things : that the recently overworked individual is due for a well-deserved rest , or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence . \\nthe latter\\'s the case with john mctiernan and \" the thirteenth warrior , \" which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring \\'98 opening - and fast on the heels of mctiernan\\'s \" the thomas crown affair \" remake , a flick that got good reviews . \\nyou don\\'t have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that \" thirteenth \" won\\'t be so lucky . \\nreportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton , whose \" eaters of the dead \" novel provides \" warrior \" \\'s source ( and its initial title ) , this messy melange of culture-clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish - sorta like \" braveheart \" without any of the passion . \\nbut the bloodshed certainly remains : there\\'s enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills , though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness . \\nthese circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside . \\nthe good guys are loud , crude , often unintelligible and - judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot , which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador ( antonio banderas ) who tags along quite reluctantly . \\nthey\\'re also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises . \\nyou\\'ll wince , you\\'ll groan , you\\'ll grouse , \" haven\\'t we seen this guy killed twice before ? \" \\nbanderas stands confused amidst the chaos , partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal-skin fashion run amok . \\nhe\\'s not the hero - his soulful eyes and lean build don\\'t exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions - and \" the thirteenth warrior \" wisely doesn\\'t pretend he is , allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough . \\nlet the characters interaction sans swords and shields , however , and there\\'s still a struggle - for the audience to follow or even care about the story . \\nit isn\\'t the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance , murky political intrigue , veteran actor omar sharif ( \" funny girl \" ) dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic \" indiana jones and the temple of doom \" -esque chase through the villains\\' underground lair . \\nall this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr . , but the collaboration between \" die hard \" -helmer mctiernan and \" jurrasic park \" -creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights , graphic action and unintentionally telling moments . \\nheard during \" the thirteenth warrior \" \\'s final scene : a dog whimpering . \\nhow appropriate . \\n',\n"," b'you\\'ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . \\nthe title is generic . \\nit\\'s meaningless . \\nand i can\\'t believe it\\'s good business . \\nwhen you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? \\nyuck . \\nthe movie itself deserves your attention . \\nfor sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down . \\nonly mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i\\'ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it\\'s not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . \\nmuch to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . \\nhis track record isn\\'t as solid as schwarzenegger\\'s , but he\\'s a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . \\nin 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong\\'s premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . \\n ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo\\'s radically different director\\'s cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) \\nthis follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo\\'s more operatic offerings . \\nthe surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo\\'s subsequent broken arrow . \\nhere\\'s the rundown . \\nvan damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that\\'s alain\\'s exact double . \\nturns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . \\nalain does some investigating . \\nhe finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . \\nassuming michael\\'s identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael\\'s girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . \\nthat\\'s as much as you need to know . \\nthe story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . \\nthere\\'s a love story , too , but i didn\\'t find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . \\nshe\\'s great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can\\'t really be described as \" acting . \" \\nof course , \" acting \" isn\\'t really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme\\'s ) . \\nthe movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . \\n ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) \\nthe stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme\\'s stand-in makes his work no less impressive . \\nthere\\'s only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . \\nand lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . \\nthe main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo\\'s hard-boiled , it\\'s an amazing moment . \\nbut it\\'s a moment that\\'s hard to reproduce in hollywood . \\n ( for one thing , hollywood doesn\\'t yet have chow yun-fat ! ) \\nwhile woo\\'s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . \\nthe very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam\\'s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . \\nthe film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam\\'s shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . \\nthe performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there\\'s an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn\\'t always overcome the limitations of its genre . \\nthe story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme\\'s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . \\nbut it\\'s not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it\\'s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . \\nvan damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man\\'s best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid . \\n',\n"," b\"in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism . \\nwhich wasn't so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies . \\nin such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany . \\nof course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons . \\nfor them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era . \\nwhich , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience . \\none of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn . \\nsalon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 . \\nin 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats . \\nnone of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged . \\nthe most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn't know the real purpose of that enterprise . \\nscreenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names . \\nschellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top . \\nkitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer . \\ncaught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel . \\nthere she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe . \\nwhen margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged . \\nshe informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg . \\nthose who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation . \\nbut , although salon kitty doesn't happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty . \\nunfortunately , brass seems to overuse other cinematical references , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti's the damned , but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin's unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli's musical numbers from cabaret . \\nall in all , salon kitty is failure , although with some very interesting moments . \\n\",\n"," b'for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality , trois is surprisingly tame . \\ndespite it\\'s lurid subject matter and it\\'s passing nod to fatal attraction , it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film . \\nfreshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life . \\nthey have a beautiful house in suburbia . \\njermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm . \\njasmine is his supportive wife , who is finishing up her college degree . \\nin an opening montage via a home video of the pair , we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs . \\nthis is a couple that has it all . \\ninto this eden slithers the lure of lust . \\ndespite his outward appearance , jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person . \\na glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business , oblivious to jasmine\\'s concerns . \\nwe also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a-trois , much to jasmine\\'s dismay . \\nas jermaine puts it , \" don\\'t you want to be sexually free ? \" \\njermaine shares his desire with co-worker terrence ( smith ) , who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter . \\nthe woman , jade ( palmer ) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine . \\njade , at one point was a college student , too . \\nunlike jasmine , she found herself pregnant , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet . \\nto further reinforce their differences , it\\'s revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son . \\ninevitably , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine\\'s part , the forbidden act is consummated . \\nthe aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine\\'s property with the hint that the violence may escalate . \\nby this point , trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama : a fatal attraction without the social significance . \\nthe exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical . \\njermaine comes off as insincere , sexually driven and selfish . \\njasmine is bland and subservient . \\njade comes off a bit sympathetically , but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy . \\nyet another tale of a sexually aggressive \" dog \" of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating , innocent mate . \\nthe last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve , but by this point , will you even care ? \\nif the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending , perhaps there could have been some freshness to it . \\nas it stands , trois is pretty standard fare . \\n',\n"," b'can you say \"

germany ( named hansel ) loves the american music . \\none day , he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g . i . , but first , he must get a sex change ( enter hedwig ) . \\nonce married , the two move to the states , but quickly thereafter , get a divorce . \\nat that point , hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy , who soon turns into a star . \\nthat boy also turns his back on hedwig , and it isn\\'t long before hedwig puts together his/her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants . \\nthis is the story of his/her life , told via flashbacks and musical numbers . \\ncritique : an artsy-fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell , doesn\\'t really come together as a whole , with over-the-top symbolism , incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through . \\nin fact , this isn\\'t so much of a realistic , articulate , behind-the-scenes look at the rise of a rock \\'n roll star , as it is an ambiguous , overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man , his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet . \\ni guess that i was expecting the former going in . \\nthe film is somewhat interesting to a point , but i was personally never able to involve myself too much , as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant . \\nbut it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience . \\nchances are that if you are a fan of the wall , the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla , queen of the desert , the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point , and provide the lyrics of their song , on-screen ) . \\nwell , i personally don\\'t care for those films , and didn\\'t really get into the whole \" show \" atmosphere of this movie either . \\ni guess i might\\'ve looked at it all too literally , but like i said earlier , i just didn\\'t care enough about the characters to delve into the \" so the butterfly represents his freedom ? \" \\nside of things . \\nall i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn\\'t make me feel any more fulfilled . \\nwhat was hedwig\\'s relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ? \\nwhat happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ? \\n ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? ) \\nwhat ever happened to the lawsuit ? \\nand more . . . \\nall of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat . \\nif the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality , then that\\'s one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well . \\ni didn\\'t get it . \\nthe film\\'s humor also didn\\'t tickle my funny bone either . \\nthen again , i\\'ve seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen . \\nsome of these films are also better enjoyed with the added \" atmosphere \" of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience . \\nbut being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i didn\\'t leave the theater very satisfied . \\ni came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers . \\ni will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene . \\nnote : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single \" mainstream \" critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself . \\nbut having said that , the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the \" official \" critics , while i , a regular \" joblo \" in the audience , just wouldn\\'t get what all the fuss was about . \\nthis movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews . \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nmoulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) -

series of \" predator pics \" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- \" jaws \" ) and were revived recently by the godawful \" anaconda . \" \\n \" placid \" claims to be a \" horror/comedy \" -it\\'s directed by the same guy who did \" house \" -but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of \" anaconda . \" \\npaleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body that had been bitten in half on the lake . \\ndiscovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile ( which shouldn\\'t even be in this hemisphere ) , kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) . \\nthey\\'re joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them . \\nalong the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady who lives out on the lake . \\nyou know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone\\'s dangling legs while \" jaws \" -like music plays , one character ( hector ) who\\'s obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest , another character who insists that the predator can\\'t possibly exist . \\nunlike its slippery cousin \" anaconda , \" \" lake placid \" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek , which is self-defeating . \\nthe result is neither scary nor funny ; it\\'s just tedious . \\nwhile director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of \" friday the 13th \" and \" halloween h20 \" ) , screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like \" ally mcbeal \" and \" chicago hope \" ) doesn\\'t seem to have the stomach for a chomp \\'em up flick . \\nthe body count is surprisingly low and doesn\\'t include any of the major characters , and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . \\n ( \" lake placid \" manages to have it both ways-i\\'ll let you discover how for yourself ) . \\nthe croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course . \\nlike the snake in \" anaconda , \" the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn\\'t seem real ; it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . \\n \" lake placid \" also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine . \\nthere is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how \" we really don\\'t know much about crocodiles . \" \\nthey would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers . \\na movie like this doesn\\'t have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? \\ncreature from outer space ? ) , but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on . \\npullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot . \\nmost of the time , they\\'re probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers . \\nplatt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts , and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script . \\n',\n"," b'when critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do , their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails , sometimes even mock death threats from those who ( i suppose ) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment . \\neven politicians ( ! ) \\ntend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising \" filth \" like pulp fiction . \\nthese [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic\\'s job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be . \\nthusly patch adams isn\\'t a bad film because it\\'s about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it\\'s a bad film because it\\'s a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation . \\nsimilarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it\\'s still an unpleasantly maudlin mess . \\nthe picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world . \\n12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we\\'re all living in a frank capra movie . \\nmeanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the \" movement \" which has apparently begun to grow . \\npay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core . \\nit\\'s as if director mimi leder didn\\'t have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn\\'t \" gutsy \" enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for . \\nso the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being \" saved \" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn\\'t quite sure if it\\'s ready to buy into its own utopian blather . \\npay it forward offers \" crowd pleasing \" elements for general audiences ; jay mohr\\'s umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson\\'s earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking \" black hoodlum with a heart of gold \" ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ? . \\nhurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a \" nigga \" and says things like \" can you feel me ? \" \\nleave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment . \\n ( maybe spike\\'s flick wasn\\'t so misguided after all ) . \\nthese scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you\\'ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings . \\nwhile the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience . \\nit\\'s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns . \\none scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt\\'s hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip . \\nspacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance . \\nmaybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he\\'s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference . \\nthe usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender . \\nin one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i\\'m not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol . \\nthe scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it\\'s all very theatrical , especially hunt\\'s performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar . \\npay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn\\'t get academy awards . \\nthe picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists . \\neven haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections . \\nhis acting has become broader , less intimate ; it\\'s as if we can make out the little munchkin\\'s thoughts : \" boy this outta floor em \" . \\nnaturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher . \\nnever mind that the two couldn\\'t be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary . \\nnevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics . \\nbut oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life . \\nthey\\'re so adorable . \\nof course the blame can\\'t all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row . \\nthe first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth\\'s possible demise by a crazed meteorite . \\nthe first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) . \\ndeep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it\\'s a movie that treats earth\\'s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days . \\nthe film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching . \\nin pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : \" see my movie isn\\'t as na ? ve as you might think \" she seems to be saying . \\nno , it\\'s just horribly confused . \\n',\n"," b'this is your definitive \" hollywood \" movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we\\'ve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn\\'t used enough here ) , i\\'m afraid the film would have been completely unbearable . \\nin this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend . \\nwhile in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her . \\nover money ( how original ) . \\nwhile in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition . \\nnow she has learned about a law titled \" double jeopardy \" stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) . \\nnow her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims . \\nskipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . . \\nbut she\\'s terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn\\'t really add to the movie at all ; just takes away . \\nas i\\'d said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with . \\nhe was much more of a supporting character . \\nwhich is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with . \\ni feel this film had alot going for it . \\noriginality not being an issue . \\nthe acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive . \\nthe plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better . \\nthe action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) . \\ni was just left unsatisfied in the long run . \\nso basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway . \\nkeep this in mind , if you\\'re in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive . \\nd+ \\n',\n"," b' \" saving silverman \" is a good example of a good comedy gone bad . \\nas a love story it is good , however as a comedy it falls flat on it\\'s face . \\ni think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times . . . and \\nthose were just chuckles at the most ! \\nthe movie doesn\\'t have the oomph to make it a great movie , and doesn\\'t have the script to make it a funny movie . \\nwayne lefessier ( steven zahn ) , j . d . mcnugent ( jack black ) , and darren silverman ( jason biggs ) have grown up all their lives together , they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end . \\nwhile in a bar after doing a show with their band , based on their love of neil diamond , darren meets a young woman named judith ( amanda peet ) whom he instantly falls for . \\nwayne and j . d . however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again , it\\'s up to wayne and j . d . to try and begin saving silverman . \\nthe performances are topnotch and surprisingly , they are what keep the movie afloat . \\njason biggs right off the flop \" loser \" does an ok job playing silverman , but he is stale and flat at times . \\nsteve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier , and even though the movie is about silverman , lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself . \\njack black is well jack black , and he does an all right job as j . d . but he isn\\'t as funny as he has been in the past . \\namanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith , and neil diamond plays neil diamond ( he\\'s better at singing than acting ) . \\nanyway the performances in the film are good , but it\\'s too bad the script isn\\'t . \\nspeaking of script , hank nelkan\\'s choppy script is not only badly written , but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street . \\nthe trailer for the movie , as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie , especially the funniest parts . \\nsomewhere \" saving silverman \" was meant to be a good movie , and it could have been , but alas in the end it wasn\\'t . \\ndennis dugan\\'s direction is all right , he adds a few directorial touches here and there , nothing special being a simple comedy . \\n \" saving silverman \" is a perfectly bad movie in more ways than one . \\nit has a great cast , a good director and a sweet story . . . it\\'s \\njust too bad it has a bad script and is all together a bad movie . \\n',\n"," b'if you\\'re the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you ! \\nindeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them . \\nit\\'s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film . \\nbut at least we\\'re warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show . \\nwhat are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ? \\nfirst , the movie gives us an introductory premise . \\nhuge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared . \\noooh . . . scary ! \\nsecondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score . \\nthird , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams ) . \\nhe operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy . \\nfinally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him . \\nthey are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are . \\nduring their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs . \\nspotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way . \\nlittle do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster . \\nyet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds . \\nthis is nothing more than a by-the-book action film . \\ntheir realization of the situation that they\\'re in doesn\\'t happen until they are in the bowels of the boat . \\nthose who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed . \\nthe corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have . \\nyet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary \" boo \" moments . \\nbut most of it is just outright silly . \\nand this film is unusually gory too . \\nmonsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains . \\nthere is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive . \\nhe screams horribly as the monster\\'s digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away . \\nadditionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films . \\nthe mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock . \\nto be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was . \\nit\\'s moronic fun at best . \\nso , if you\\'re hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness , then this might just hit the spot . \\n',\n"," b'this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don\\'t say anything you can\\'t guess 10 minutes into the

complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing . \\nit establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again . \\nso , she helps him kill three businessmen . \\nscumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back . \\nproblem is , he doesn\\'t have any skin , and even after three or four

constitute \" horror , \" in my opinion . \\n',\n"," b'when considering david fincher\\'s latest film , \" the game \" , four words come to mind . \\n \" don\\'t believe the hype . \" \\nthis michael douglas vehicle , from the director of \" seven \" , isn\\'t nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe . \\nthe film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy . \\nthis isn\\'t simply virtual reality . \\nthis is real life with a deadly twist . \\non his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn ) . \\nconrad has a special birthday present for his brother . \\nhe hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services . \\n \" they make your life fun , \" conrad tells him . \\nnicholas humors his brother , telling him he\\'ll call , but it\\'s clear he has no time for any foolish , \" fantasy role-playing , \" as he calls it . \\nthen , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they\\'re all about . \\nhe ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have . \\nnevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening . \\nof course , when we\\'ve only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect . \\ndouglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands . \\none of those films , \" basic instinct \" , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven . \\nthe premise of \" the game , \" is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , \" total recall . \" \\nin that case , the premise was implanting someone else\\'s memories as a way to enhance one\\'s own life through a dream vacation . \\nyet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience . \\nwe live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn . \\nin theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn\\'t . \\nall we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed . \\nnow , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again . \\n \" don\\'t believe the hype . \" \\n \" the game \" is not a thrilling roller coaster ride . \\nas a suspense-thriller , it doesn\\'t do much but spin in circles . \\nby the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot . \\nis it any wonder douglas won\\'t be able to resist the charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of glenn close ? \\nno ? well , how about sharon stone ? \\nthought so ) . \\nif anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven\\'t seen that many films . \\nthere is no suspense here . \\ntrust me , i looked hard to find some . \\ni had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations . \\nfincher aim\\'s for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas . \\nthere are those that might say \" the game \" is not intended to be viewed literally . \\ni would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film . \\nthe film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues . \\nthere is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who\\'s in on the whole thing . \\nhe is charged by his paranoia . \\nhe is looking at the world through new eyes . \\nit is the last thought-provoking moment in the film . \\nfrom there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us . \\nany significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device . \\nat the outset , we\\'re told each \" game \" is tailored to the individual . \\nultimately , this \" game \" is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul . \\nyet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we\\'re given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is . \\ni wanted to like this film more than i did . \\ni look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized . \\ni can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn\\'t mean we were seeing what was really happening . \\nbryan singer\\'s \" the usual suspects \" for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas . \\nalso , there is the underrated \" jacob\\'s ladder , \" with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism . \\nhere are two examples of films that don\\'t simply manipulate for manipulations\\' sake . \\nthere are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place . \\none major issue that comes up in \" the game \" is whether or not the whole \" illusion \" is just a highly sophisticated con game . \\nwell , i can tell you right now , after you\\'ve spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing . \\n',\n"," b'in my review of there\\'s something about mary , i said something to the effect of \" laughter isn\\'t everything . \" \\ni now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter isn\\'t everything , unless i\\'m watching a jim abrahams film . \\nsee , spoofs are easy with me . \\ni love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love . \\nsometimes i\\'m the only one in the theater laughing . \\nsometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high-pitched in comparison to my speaking voice ( it cuts right through everyone else\\'s laughter ) . \\nsometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film . \\nabraham\\'s latest film , mafia ! , induced this kind of hysteria upon me . \\nit\\'s gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i\\'m the guy who laughs at everything . \\nthere may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness . \\ni enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought-provoking . \\nmost lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense . \\nmafia ! \\nhas no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh . \\nthe film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino . \\nour hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire . \\nto describe the story of mafia ! \\nis absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout . \\nalong the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing . \\nmovies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction . \\nabrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia ! \\nto his experience . \\nhe takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) . \\nthe actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film . \\nmohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here . \\nhe looks like he\\'s having so much fun that he\\'s containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) . \\nhe\\'s probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material . \\nlloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando\\'s godfather , while pamela gidley is dead-on in a full-blown mockery of sharon stone . \\nthe hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i\\'m supposed to give examples of things and be specific . \\nunfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia ! \\nthat i can\\'t remember a lot of what made me laugh . \\nbut that\\'s a good sign : mafia ! \\nis so funny that i wasn\\'t even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory . \\ni laughed so hard that it shut off my brain . \\ni know that doesn\\'t sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain . \\nfinally , a film that does this for me . \\n',\n"," b'woof ! too bad that leap of faith was the title of a 1992 comedy starring steve martin and debra winger , because that\\'s what\\'s required to watch this incredulous howler starring bruce willis as--of all things--a psychologist . \\nnot since the reagan administration has there been an acting stretch of such magnitude ! \\nalas , mickey rourke , we hardly knew ye . \\nstory opens with a campy kick--willis is treating a patient who abruptly steps out of the window to take the best flying leap since charles durning dove in the hudsucker proxy . \\nshe goes splat , he goes ugh , and his character spends the rest of the film colorblind . \\nreally . \\nthe good doctor then moves to sunny l . a . , where he rooms with an old college chum ( scott bakula ) , a therapist who\\'s getting death threats from someone in his monday evening group . \\nbuddy bites it in the second reel ( no surprise there ) and willis agrees to take over both the group and the death threats . \\nfor his troubles as therapy man , willis gets to share some cut-from-nc17 love scenes with the lover\\'s jane march while dodging nails , cars , and rattlesnakes . \\nwhy\\'d it have to be snakes ? \\ncolor of night is the worst movie of the year . \\nperiod . \\nforget north , clifford , or , heaven help us , even on deadly ground . \\nhere is a movie misfire so audaciously awful that you can\\'t help but wonder how the actors all kept straight faces while filming . \\nfor starters , the \" group \" is a collection of mixed nuts better suited to bob newhart than bruce willis . \\nthese are realistic portrayals of the mentally unhealthy ? \\nplaying a prissy obsessive/compulsive , cuckoos nest alumni brad dourif , alone , may set the psychology profession back ten years . \\nthe plot\\'s a wreck with laughable dialogue ,

nincompoop plot and cuckoo characterizations , he overfills the film with enough canny camera shots and zany set-pieces to make the effort almost worth watching . \\nhis token freeway chase is ok , but the director has more fun with a vertiginous ending ala ( most recently ) fatal analysis . \\nacting credits are across-the-board awful . \\nwillis can be forgiven because he\\'s filming die hard

and doesn\\'t quite know what she wants out of life . \\none day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others . \\nshe starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can\\'t act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature . \\ncritique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone . \\nthis is a \" feel-good \" kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life . \\nit doesn\\'t pretend to be deep , it doesn\\'t weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it\\'s basically just a \" cute movie \" in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it\\'s quite a bit better and much more original than the former ) . \\none thing that this film isn\\'t though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of \" best \" in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year ) . \\nit actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it\\'s a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren\\'t as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms . amelie herself , which got frustrating . \\nthankfully , this film doesn\\'t bog itself down with too much of that stuff , and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes , to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind-hearted french girl . \\non the whole , it\\'s a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man . \\nthe lead , audrey tautou , is perfect for the role , and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film . \\nunfortunately , the rest of the cast isn\\'t as well-developed , and even though most of them are pretty appealing , a couple could\\'ve been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot-wise , by the film\\'s end ( what happened to the guy in the caf ? who was spying on his ex-girlfriend the whole movie ? ) . \\nnow i haven\\'t seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of \" scene \" that they\\'re developing over in \" le pays du vin \" , i wouldn\\'t mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked- ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co-star in this film ) . \\ngranted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film\\'s visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn\\'t help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story-line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world . \\nin fact , i\\'d recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol\\' time at the movie house , with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination , a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts . \\nand this guy directed alien : resurrection ? \\nget outta here ! ! \\nnote : i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves/hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film . \\nit was very original , very well shot and very nostalgic , as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described . \\ngood stuff ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nchocolat ( 6/10 ) - crimson rivers ( 8/10 ) - ghost world ( 9/10 ) - like water for

done right , with at least slightly evident restraint , they can be engaging , sweeping , appealing . \\nbut it\\'s a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle , a hollow , boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephron\\'s whiny views of life and romance . \\ntom hanks and meg ryan , two of hollywood\\'s most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed , repectively . \\nbaldwin\\'s wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son , jonah , seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse . \\njonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems . \\nsam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show , but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out . \\nephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it . \\nannie is a happy woman . \\nshe is engaged to walter , an allergy-prone working man and seems to be perfectly content . \\nbut after hearing sam the widower on the radio show , she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it . \\nfive years after this movie hit theaters , hanks , ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better , although still sub-par romantic comedy you\\'ve got mail , which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet . \\nat least that movie had a sense of spontaneity . \\nhere it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five . \\nthe fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory . \\nsleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o\\'donnell . \\nbut none of them can save the film from being a bore . \\nits characters are dull and empty , its script isn\\'t funny or particularly charming . \\nthe script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue \" sleepless in seattle , \" whom she has never even seen . \\nit\\'s the kind of life decision that real people don\\'t make , and its a major , unforgivable plausibility sacrifice . \\nin essence , this movie\\'s purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn\\'t even exist . \\nit\\'s a ten minute short film with ninety-five minutes of filler . \\nif you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didn\\'t have to review it , you could just call me \" asleep in philadelphia . \" \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n',\n"," b'working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . \\ndespite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) . \\nthe problem is , of course , that there aren\\'t many good roles available for black women . \\ntake away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve\\'s bayou , and all that\\'s left is a chance to be someone\\'s girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim . \\nas a result , for pinkett smith\\'s first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . \\nactually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s . \\nmayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is . \\nthe film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith\\'s woo and tommy davidson\\'s tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren\\'t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags . \\nunfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q . \\nthe situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of \" free lobotomy \" lab experiment . \\nwoo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . \\nher latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . \\nnow , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she\\'s about to meet mr . right , and that he\\'ll be a virgo . \\nlater that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo . \\nit\\'s not love at first sight , however . \\nthings get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a \" quiet \" dinner . \\nin the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad \" white \" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it\\'s only fair that we get a \" black \" effort of the same low caliber . \\nas in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . \\nthe question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ? \\nin a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is . \\nin woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project . \\nfor those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there\\'s a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . \\nsadly , that\\'s one of the film\\'s most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . \\ndespite exuding charm from every pore , there\\'s little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson\\'s script . \\nsince it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops . \\n',\n"," b'vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents . \\nand , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) . \\nbut lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre . \\nand remind us he does in his latest film , vampires . \\nthere was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema\\'s immensely successful blade , released in august . \\nthe two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don\\'t even agree on some basic points of the slaying method . \\n ( for instance , blade\\'s main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow\\'s technique is a wooden stake to the heart . ) \\nblade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate . \\nboth have their advantages , and here , carpenter\\'s style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered . \\nwhen it\\'s all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum . \\nthis time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) . \\nhe\\'s a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch . \\nhe and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a \" master \" ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . \\nvalek kills all of jack\\'s team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old . \\napparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime . \\nso with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation . \\nthe script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year . \\ncrow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism . \\nbaldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith\\'s bad guy . \\ngriffith\\'s intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he\\'s got to talk sometime . \\nluckily , he\\'s got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance . \\nall said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one . \\ncertainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters . \\n',\n"," b'synopsis : an aging master art thief , his supplier , and a young , buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be ( or are they ? ) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium . \\ncomments : this movie was boring . \\nplain and simple . \\nentrapment should not have been boring . \\nit stars sean connery , who can still carry an action film despite his age , catherine zeta-jones , a likeable enough film presence , and ving rhames , ultra-cool star of pulp fiction and mission : impossible . \\nit takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears ( a current \" hot topic \" in the news ) in its storyline , which is set at the end of 1999 . \\nit has some genuinely well-staged action sequences . \\nso , what went wrong ? \\nplenty , unfortunately . \\nthe major problem with entrapment is its script . \\nit has a been-there , done-that feel to it . \\nnothing seems particularly inventive or original , so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags ( it runs nearly two hours ) . \\nthe screenwriters , for example , periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes ( i . e . \\n \" 4 days to the millennium \" ) . \\nthis device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days . \\nthe characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth \" surprise \" revelation is made . \\nentrapment , in other words , relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character\\'s true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion . \\nthe star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can\\'t help but feel the actors are wasted in this production . \\nsean connery is given such mind-numbing lines as \" never trust a naked woman . \" \\nving rhames\\' character seems like an afterthought ; he\\'s not developed at all . \\nthe camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta-jones\\'s tight wardrobe . \\nthis , in and of itself , is not bad , but , after a while , it has a juvenile feel to it . \\nat least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they\\'re exploiting the female body . \\nentrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development ( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her , in tights , arc and pivot around laser beams ) . \\nthe tagline for this movie reads \" the trap is set . \" \\nit sure is , on those who spent money to see this movie . \\nentrapment really isn\\'t that bad ; it is watchable . \\ni would suggest , however , one waits until this is on cable or television to see it . \\n',\n"," b'there\\'s a thin line between satire and controversy , and mike nichols ( the birdcage , wolf ) has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election . \\nbased on the book written by \" anonymous \" ( actually former \" newsweek \" writer joe klein ) , john travolta plays governor jack stanton . \\nbut he doesn\\'t actually play stanton . \\nhe plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise ) . \\nthe film is taken from the perspective of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton . \\nhe searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations , and whether it be keeping the history of his boss\\' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician , he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers . \\nrichard jemmons ( billy bob thorton ) and daisy green ( maura tierney ) team up with henry as the would-be president\\'s advisors , and hire lesbian veteran libby holden ( kathy bates ) as the campaign\\'s eccentric \" tougher than dirt \" incriminator . \\ntogether they face all sorts of sexual allegations , the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race . \\nin its satire and controversy , primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog : they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty-gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue . \\nbut whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media , primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it\\'s characters , letting us understand what they want and why , and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent . \\nseeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look . \\nand the rest of the cast also make superb performances - adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden . \\nat occasions , you can\\'t help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste . \\nthere are long slabs of time where john travolta ( unquestionably the most interesting to watch ) is missed from the screen ; and since it is awkwardly structured as henry\\'s story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot - or even the point of the film . \\nhaving said that , make no mistake - primary colors is always enjoyable to watch . \\nbut frequently we have to ask ourselves - exactly what are we watching ? \\nmost of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh , but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary , and almost unsuitable , to the rest of the film . \\nbut as i mentioned before , there is a thin line between satire and controversy - and for the most part , primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far-from-overpowering look at winning the public\\'s opinion . \\nalthough at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely , focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is . \\nthankfully , it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it\\'s scary . \\n',\n"," b\"i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality . \\nbut darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations . \\nit's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation . \\nin addition , it's also a terrific family film . \\nthis is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools . \\nit could also be described as `mrs . \\nstreep's opus' . \\nyes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad . \\nout of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view . \\nshe is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ? \\nslowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied . \\none thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven . \\nafter leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama . \\nat first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material . \\nit doesn't carry the heart-warming courage of `mr . \\nholland's opus' , but `music of the heart' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth . \\nthe tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate . \\nyes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work . \\nangela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience . \\nblue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest . \\ngloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force . \\nit's like a schoolteacher's version of `thelma and louise' , in a restrained but effective manner . \\nthe movie tackles more issues than just guaspari's teaching of violin . \\nthere's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman . \\nin it's dramatic build-up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth . \\nit's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life-altering decision . \\nit's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal . \\nwatching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed `scream' ? \\nof course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed `music of the heart' ? \\nmission accomplished , wes . \\nthankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film . \\nin it's entirety , it's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile . \\nthe child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ? d and predictable in the extreme . \\nthe mother who doesn't want her son to be learning `white man's music' , the unexpected casuality . . . \\nbasically everything is there . \\nit doesn't strike the perfect chord , but `music of the heart' is highly convincing . \\nthe uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better , but `music of the heart' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals . \\n\",\n"," b'in roger michell\\'s romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it\\'s name to the film\\'s title . \\none day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . \\nquickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . \\nthe film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna\\'s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress\\'s appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . \\nwithout words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . \\nfollowing , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . \\ni don\\'t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn\\'t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie\\'s beginning , but there it is . \\nif there were ever a clear case for \" less is more , \" this would be it . \\nthe film is told nearly first person from william\\'s point of view , as he is in every scene . \\nby nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . \\nin fact , much of notting hill\\'s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . \\na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he\\'s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . \\nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . \\nwilliam assures her he wouldn\\'t say a word , then adds , \" well , i\\'ll probably tell myself now and then , but i\\'d never believe it . \" \\ngreat stuff . \\nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we don\\'t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . \\nwe\\'re constantly exposed to william\\'s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don\\'t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . \\nthere are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we\\'re not sure what she\\'s been thinking all the times in between . \\nthis , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant\\'s film hands down . \\nhe gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . \\njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress\\'s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character\\'s unpredictable behavior . \\nanna doesn\\'t get a lot of our compassion . \\nthis romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . \\nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike , william\\'s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . \\nhugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william\\'s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister\\'s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . \\nit\\'s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . \\nroger michell\\'s use of visuals doesn\\'t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . \\nfor example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . \\nwhereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying \" eight months later , \" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william\\'s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . \\nanother memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . \\nwe\\'re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird\\'s eye view of the ground below . \\nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film\\'s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . \\nit\\'s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today\\'s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . \\nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . \\nnotting hill\\'s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . \\nfor a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that\\'s not so bad , now is it ? \\n',\n"," b'i have a confession . \\neven though i am a movie junkie-i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies-i\\'ve never seen any of the original godzillas . \\n ( note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u . s . godzilla released in 1998 ; it\\'s the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni-sen mireniamu . ) \\nso , part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000-the latest entry in an almost 50-year old franchise . \\nthis was a long-awaited treat . \\ni was expecting a goofy good time , complete with bad dubbing , science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line . \\nthe last thing i expected was for the movie to be so ? boring . \\ni can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt . \\nyou do get all of the \" so bad they\\'re good \" traits so normally associated with the franchise . \\nbut you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot . \\nit\\'s a deal i wasn\\'t willing to accept . \\nhiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura\\'s script crams in way too many details , and in many cases , fails to follow up on them . \\nthe maneuver is not only disconcerting , but gives the movie a permanent logy , weighty feel . \\ngodzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops . \\nwas it a whim ? \\na bold political statement ? \\ni don\\'t know . \\nits foe , an ancient meteor that looks like prudential\\'s logo , doesn\\'t just fight the beast from the far east . \\nno , it\\'s got to have life-saving powers , a plot to erase \" the data \" from japan , a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature . \\nthere\\'s a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit ( takehiro murata ) and a slimy government official ( hiroshi abe ) over the handling of godzilla , and personal issues . \\nand then there\\'s the plucky news photographer and blah , blah , blah . \\nit\\'s like watching magnolia all over again-except without the good writing , keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs . \\nwhat a waste . \\nwhen the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you , godzilla 2000 does the job-it\\'s entertaining and goes down easy . \\nthe action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish . \\nthe dubbing is nice and awful , with murata sounding like he\\'s in constant need of a cough drop . \\nas for the dialogue , one line summarizes the goofiness factor : \" did anyone see that flying rock go by ? \" \\nthis movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that i\\'ve heard the word \" imbecile \" used in casual conversation . \\nthough the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments , i wouldn\\'t take kids to see it . \\nthey\\'ll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose . \\n',\n"," b'perhaps if the impostors didn\\'t have so much going for it , it wouldn\\'t have been such a tremendous disappointment . \\nwritten , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire . \\nsputtering like a two-day old campfire , the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed . \\nthe film\\'s other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator\\'s aide in bulworth . \\nthe bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub . \\nall are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes . \\n ( the audience will easily identify with allen\\'s sentiments . ) \\nwith the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter . \\nthe stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . \\nthe plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship . \\nin order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship\\'s stewards . \\nthe over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . \\nwhen the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice\\'s mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze . \\nat other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms . \\nwith the film\\'s chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . \\nthe press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . \\ntoo bad they weren\\'t more concerned with the audience\\'s potential enjoyment . \\nthe jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . \\none wonders if anyone ever viewed the film\\'s dailies . \\nsurely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . \\nit is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn\\'t pull it off , they should have just given up . \\n \" the show is over for this fella , \" steve buscemi\\'s character says towards the end . \\nthe mystery is why they didn\\'t all give up in the beginning . \\nthere must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . \\nthe impostors runs 1 : 42 . \\nit is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up . \\n',\n"," b'ok , i admit it--i find camp amusement with the spice girls . \\nyes , the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual \" identities , \" they of the annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks and cheesy unifying mantra of \" girl power . \" \\nbut not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn\\'t enough to carry their big screen debut , a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world . \\nthe film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- \" scary \" ( melanie brown ) , \" baby \" ( emma bunton ) , \" sporty \" ( melanie chisolm ) , \" ginger \" ( geri halliwell ) , and \" posh \" ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad \" too much \" ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) . \\na few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london\\'s royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls\\' manager , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant \" mate \" ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o\\'brien ) . \\ncapped off by a live rendition of the girls\\' bouncy hit \" say you\\'ll be there , \" a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ? \\nwrong . it\\'s all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . \\ni must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke between them , much less a organized framework for all the \" wacky \" goings-on . \\nspice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . \\nwhile a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there--during a \" dance bootcamp \" scene , the girls sing the lyric \" we know how we got this far/strength and courage and a wonderbra \" --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . \\nsome gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore\\'s recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor-heavy advice to clifford . \\nthe only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . \\nha ha . \\nas weak as the script is , i think there\\'s one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves . \\nthe point is not that they can\\'t act ( and , for the record , they really _can\\'t_ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four-minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world . \\nposh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . \\nbaby\\'s persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls\\' identities are a little harder to flesh out . \\nthere really isn\\'t much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being \" ginger \" or \" scary \" ? \\napparently , just their wardrobes . \\nspice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices\\' signature hit , \" wannabe . \" \\nthe song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much-needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self-referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters\\' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman\\'s the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . \\nthis section of the film , involving all manner of derring-do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . \\nspice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful . \\nbut this sloppy enterprise surely won\\'t win them any new fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states . \\nonce the hype disappears , spice world will likely serve as the the spices\\' final hurrah in america . \\n',\n"," b'what were they thinking ? \\nnostalgia for the seventies is bad enough , but do we really need an eighties film ? \\nrobbie hart ( adam sandler ) used to want to be a rock and roll star , but in 1985 he\\'s singing at weddings and having a good time . \\na romantic at heart , he loves weddings and is just about to get married to his high-school sweetie . \\nwhen she leaves him waiting at the altar , his tune changes to \" love stinks \" . \\nhe meets waitress julia ( drew barrymore ) who is engaged to a junk-bonds salesman and you know that they are going to get together . \\nin fact you know everything that is going to happen during this movie . \\nsandler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role , but there is no spark . \\nbarrymore doesn\\'t seem to be able to convey anything other than a pretty face with nothing behind it : beauty but no attitude . \\nboth characters are just there . \\nbit parts by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show . \\nthe eighties are shoved in our face . \\nreferences to deloreans , madonna , \" dallas \" , ivana and donald , burt and loni and \" miami vice \" get old fast . \\nthe filmmakers must have realized that there wasn\\'t much entertainment to the story and thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions . \\nthey\\'re not funny and it doesn\\'t work . \\nwith change on all fronts accelerating more and more , nostalgia appears to have a great appeal , but don\\'t you think we could have more than 14 years before we yearn for the past . \\nmaybe we can look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically about el nino . \\n ( michael redman has written this column for over 23 years and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be . ) \\n',\n"," b\"there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs . \\none is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film . \\ntwo is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta . \\nto wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth . \\na science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior . \\nsci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs . \\nbattlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes . \\nhere's the `plot . ' \\nthe year is 3000 . \\nmankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) . \\na small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below . \\nthe psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver . \\na young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons . ' \\nhe is promptly captured and taken to the alien base . \\nafter several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end . \\njonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use . \\nthen the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet . \\nthe whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits . \\nroger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v' miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . . \\nand decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth . \\nchristian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie ! \\nand every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really . \\nthe psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit . \\ntravolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect . \\njonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight ! ' \\nthen there's the script : the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet' would be a difficult task to achieve . \\nwhy ? \\nbecause terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid .

epic in the history of film . \\nin january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary . \\nin this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don't do much but call attention to themselves . \\nother than these , the film is exactly the same . \\nwhy pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ? \\nsimply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born . \\nwe should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven't seen it . \\nthe plot is basic but in the same way , complex . \\nit has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight . \\nhis mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) . \\nhe and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker's two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) . \\nskywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force . \\nthe film is obviously quite star-studded . \\nbut how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones' voice would appear so many more times in the future ? \\nit just happened to work out for him . \\nthe magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker's triumph is symbolized by the audience's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever . \\n , \\n\",\n"," b'young einstein is embarrassingly lame , but that didn\\'t stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia , where it became the third largest box office hit of all time . \\nin the u . s . , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under . \\npersonally , i\\'m hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb . \\nyoung einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts . \\nhis creation is about as stupid and contrived as you\\'d expect from someone named yahoo . \\nthe movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein\\'s youth . \\nwhereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island . \\nin addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar . \\nyahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick--a clown with an insatiable curiosity . \\nalthough yahoo\\'s performance is at first endearing , the one-dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e=mc2 . \\nyahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever . \\nbut after the first twenty minutes , the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy . \\nyoung einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot . \\nyahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately , the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing . \\nalmost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . \\nthe instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the \" 1812 overture \" and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect . \\nhalfway through young einstein , i knew for sure the movie was a stinker . \\nbut it wasn\\'t until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime-time sitcoms . \\nin fact , young einstein might have been more at home on network television , where its sophomoric humor wouldn\\'t raise any eyebrows . \\n',\n"," b'synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night . \\nwhile this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter . \\ncomments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement . \\ni\\'m not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter . \\nsuspense ? \\nfamily drama ? \\nhumor ? \\nerotica ? \\nelements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them . \\ninstead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers . \\ni suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren\\'t for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing . \\nalicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter . \\nher character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters\\' fantasies . \\neveryone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends . \\nthe parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds . \\nthe father ( played by j . t . \\nwalsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband\\'s best friend . \\nnone of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music . \\nthe thug , in the meantime , proves that he\\'s evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason . \\nthe most absurd character , however , is the babysitter\\'s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead . \\nthe thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn\\'t really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes . \\nincredible ! \\n ( of course , the boyfriend\\'s original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . ) \\nif the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails . \\nthere are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute . \\nby that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them . \\nno suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception . \\nif the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails . \\ni found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs . \\nif the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic ,

football . \\nthose two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons . \\nfirst , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn\\'t mainstream and it\\'s been retread to death . \\nsecond , the sex is just bad . \\ndespite the appearance of a whipped cream

, voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer . \\nkilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes\\' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three . \\nunfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he\\'s got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) . \\nmoxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan . \\nmost regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most . \\nsimilarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer . \\nthese elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv\\'s core audience is the high school demographic . \\nthis focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv\\'s \" dawson\\'s creek , \" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role . \\nother stars are similarly young and unmemorable . \\nthere\\'s not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there\\'s not much to like about it , either . \\neverything herein has already been done , and if it hasn\\'t , the movie manages to botch it one way or another .

fifth time ) she learns that some tranquilizers she had taken have seriously deformed her unborn child . \\nshe and her husband decide , with the help of her doctor , to have an abortion . \\nbut this is the 1960s , and abortion is illegal . \\nher doctor has made arrangements to have the procedure performed withing the law , by claiming that the child is endangering the mother\\'s life . \\neverything is about to work out just fine , until sherri has the uncontrollable urge to talk about her situation with a local reporter . \\nthis sets off a media frenzy and immediately sherri is the most hated woman in the world . \\nshe and her husband are fired from their jobs , reporters are surrounding their home at all times , and most importantly , no one in the country ( and eventually other countries ) will perform the abortion . \\nthis causes emotion problems for all involved . \\n \" a private matter \" is a fascinating story and it\\'s hard to believe that this only happened 30 years or so ago . \\nit\\'s only flaw is that not once is there ever a satisfactory confrontation with sherri and any of her opponents . \\none woman passing her on the street telss her to burn in hell , and when sherri appropriately yells back , \" just tell me what i\\'m supposed to do , \" the woman has no answer . \\nno one apparently had an answer , they just wanted to control what should have been only the choice of sherri and her husband . \\nthis is an important film , telling an important story . \\nit\\'s not just about not wanting another child , it\\'s about not wanting a child who will cause severe changes in their family , none of which could be beneficial . \\nsydney pollack served as executive producer for this made for hbo movie . \\n',\n"," b'absolute power , the new film produced and directed by clint eastwood , attempts to be a thriller set in the world of hypocritical presidents and their murderous political staff . \\nit is about as thrilling as a lecture on the mating habits of the south american grasshopper . \\none can only wonder how an utterly absurd script like the one written by william goldman could have ever interested eastwood . \\nnot only is the plot unbelievable and contrived , but even the writing itself lacks any consistency or intelligence . \\ncontinually underestimating the audience , the film gives us information we already know or dont even need . \\ndetails essential to the story are so improbably convenient they are annoying ( like why would two unprepared secret service men carry two night-vision goggles in their car ? ) . \\noddly enough , the initial setup for absolute power offers interesting possibilities . \\na masterful jewel-thief ( played by clint eastwood ) witnesses the murder of the wife of a powerful millionaire ( played by e . g . \\nmarshall ) . \\nwhile robbing one of marshalls mansions , he is forced to hide in the bedrooms vault . \\nthere , through a two-way mirror , he sees the wife and another man engage in passionate foreplay . \\ntheir game of love quickly turns into a violent struggle as the man starts beating the woman . \\nin self defense , the woman grabs a letter-opener and stabs the man in the elbow . \\nshe raises her arm to stab again when she is fatally shot by two secret service men . \\nthe man ? \\nhe is the president of the united states of america . \\nwhere does the film go wrong ? \\nit cannot be the acting . \\nclint eastwood , ed harris and gene hackman as the president give type-cast , but decent performances . \\nthe cinematography is sufficient ; wild and erratic during action sequences , dark and mysterious during psychologically suspenseful scenes , and calm and warm during dramatic dialogue . \\neven the music is not as bombastic as it usually tends to be in the thriller/suspense genre . \\nthe fault clearly lies in the screenplay , and the screenplay alone . \\nwhile setting up a story about misuse of power , about the true possessors of that power , and about intrigue and double-crossing , it does not resolve it . \\nnot one buildup of suspense is resolved by an exciting climax . \\nrather , the tense situations are left dangling at the end , giving the viewer an uneasy sense of incompleteness . \\nan example of this is a very promising and tense buildup of a scene : in an attempt to arrest clint eastwood , the police have set up a trap at a small restaurant . \\npolice officers are everywhere , incognito of course . \\nat the same time , not one but two hit men are preparing to kill clint eastwood when he arrives . \\nall three parties are unaware of each others presence . \\nthis scene is tremendously exciting and the audience is wondering how clint eastwood , who might suspect this is a trap , will get himself out of this difficult position . \\nhe will probably have a brilliant plan , involving ingenious preparations . \\nhowever , when he arrives at the trap , both hit men miss ( how convenient ) and in the confusion eastwood simply walks away . \\nthe buildup of this scene took about ten minutes . \\nten minutes of close ups of the hit men loading their weapons intercut with the police preparing for the trap . \\nthe scene was resolved in less than 20 seconds . . . \\nparallel to the story line of catching the real killer is a cliche emotional tale about the estranged relationship between father eastwood and his daughter . \\nthe daughter blames her father for never being there for her , because he was either in jail or robbing a house somewhere . \\nof course their relationship takes a turn for the better during the adventure and they end up a happy family . \\nagain , it is commendable that absolute power tries to deviate from the mainstream suspense film by giving room for a dramatic subplot . \\nhowever , trying is simply not enough ! \\nthe second story line should be subtle , original and preferably unpredictable . . . \\neverything this film is not . \\nhow could a screenplay like absolute power ever get the funding to be produced ? \\nhow could eastwood , who has successfully produced and directed many outstanding films such as the brilliant unforgiven , ever believe in a project like this one ? \\ni am sad to say that my respect for the actor/director/producer has diminished substantially due to this film . \\ndirector quentin tarantino once said : \" i can make a good movie out of any bad script . \" \\ndirector clint eastwood obviously cannot . \\n',\n"," b'in life , eddie murphy and martin lawrence play two young men wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison . \\nafter about an hour of watching this movie , you begin to realize how their characters feel . \\nfortunately , for audience members there\\'s a chance to escape the nearest exit . \\nthis , undoubtedly , is eddie murphy\\'s worst movie and that\\'s an accomplishment . \\nremember the golden child , harlem nights ? \\ncompared to life , they look like citizen kane . \\nlife is long , predictable , foul-mouthed and only intermittently funny . \\nits 100-minute running time feels like 100 years . \\nrobert ramsey and matthew stone\\'s script basically consist of murphy and lawrence referring to everyone around them as \" motherf . . . s \" or \" n . . . . . \\ns . \" \\nyou lose count how many times both those obnoxious , offensive words are used . \\nand if that all it takes to write a script , than any illiterate jackass can sit at a word processor and compose a movie . \\nbut , like life , it will probably stink . \\nto be honest , the screening audience surrounding me in the theater yucked it up . \\nbut these were the same people who howled at all the flatulence and fat jokes as well . \\nlife is as sophisticated as a belch . \\nit\\'s crude and stereotypical . \\nyears ago , movies stereotypically portrayed blacks subservient , second-class people , good for being only maids and servants . \\nfor the most part , the lot of blacks and other racial groups have improved . \\nbut a new , more insidious stereotype is creeping into movies . \\nin many recent films , through actors such as murphy and chris tuckers , blacks are presented as fast-talking , conniving , scam artists or hip-hop , gun-crazy , sex-crazed youths . \\nboth sets of caricatures are demeaning . \\nand the fault does not rest with the actors . \\nthey have to eat , too . \\nit is with the people who write the scripts , the studios who green-light the projects and the audiences who accept these portrayals without protest . \\nlife\\'s only redeeming virtue is the artistry of makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly ages murphy and lawrence into 90 year olds . \\notherwise , life is an embarrassment , a blot on the resumes of those associated with it . \\nsee it at your own risk . \\n',\n"," b'saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say i wasn\\'t too impressed . \\nthis film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama . \\nsound cliche ? \\nthat\\'s only the beginning . \\nbilly zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and never seemed to get a handle on his character . \\nhe was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning , you just wanted to smack him . \\nthen he goes \" crazy \" from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it . \\ni\\'m not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting . . . \\nbut it didn\\'t all come together . \\ni think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle . . . \\nbut once again , his character was given some pretty bad dialogue , and didn\\'t react too logically to many of the situations . \\nthere was very little logical development in these characters . \\nmy biggest problem with this film was it\\'s tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible . \\nthey began to resemble g . i . joes , the greatest american hero . \\nand of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls . \\nnow a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in fact that\\'s what made die hard so much fun : the super-hero avenger type . \\nso some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but i didn\\'t think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the \" real life \" feel of covert operations in panama . \\na word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice . \\nthe jungles of panama ( or their stand-ins in this case ) formed a very picturesque background . . . \\nand the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography . \\nmany have seen the slowed down \" bullet-cam \" following the projectile to its target . \\nthis was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill . \\nit was dramatic when used in flashback . . . but \\nit seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots ( pardon the pun ) into the real time action . . . then \\nit just seemed silly . \\nall in all , not a real dog : there is some nice action , good atmosphere , and pretty photography . \\nbut the plot is pretty lame , the acting didn\\'t form a cohesive whole , and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics . \\n',\n"," b'ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film . \\nit\\'s more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner\\'s world championship wrestling ( wcw ) . \\nthe movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting . \\nthe story is very minimal and basic . \\nthere are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) . \\nthey are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming . \\nwhen they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) . \\ngordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus\\' plans . \\non the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties . \\nsounds great huh , well it\\'s not . \\nthe movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work . \\nthe jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film\\'s many duds . \\nthere is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa . \\nthe cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back . \\ni especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette\\'s tag team partner is \\'macho man\\' randy savage . \\nthey wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor . \\nthe other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan . \\nmcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw . \\nshe becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan\\'s breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face . \\nnow what didn\\'t work in this movie ? \\nthat would be the rest of it . \\nthe flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets . \\nthe two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road . \\nit\\'s not funny ; it\\'s pathetic and brainless . \\nthe film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way . \\ni watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie . \\nthe main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set . \\nalso , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in . \\ni like wrestling . \\ni watch it at home and laugh . \\nit\\'s continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn\\'t watch it . \\nthis movie wasn\\'t even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv . \\nthe only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew . \\nthe funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently . \\nthe movie was too dim-witted to be funny . \\nit is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever . \\na recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city . \\nthat movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film . \\nthe acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh . \\nnow that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads . \\nat least he has a hot wife in courtney cox . \\nhe\\'s in the funny parts of the film but there aren\\'t enough to make him look good . \\nthe music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock\\'s \" bawitdaba \" and \" cowboy \" . \\nmartin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne . \\nscript is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin . \\na fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it . \\nat times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real . \\nthe wrestlers form alliances , go to people\\'s houses and beat them up . \\nit\\'s utterly ridiculous . \\nthe whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience . \\nthe movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers . \\nthe wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie . \\nthe wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it . \\nif you\\'re going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it\\'s actually entertaining . \\nthe wrestling is betters , they\\'re funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes . \\noh and the girls are hotter . \\nis this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ? \\ndon\\'t waste your money . \\n',\n"," b\"phew , what a mess ! \\nfor his fifth collaboration with director rich- ard donner ( lethal weapon i-iii , maverick ) , mel gibson plays a motormouth , maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie , jerry , whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice ( julia roberts , acting all serious ) , the justice department employee that he has a crush on . \\nshe not interested , but another person is : a cia psychiatrist ( patrick stewart ) who promptly kidnaps him . \\nis one of jerry's conjectures correct ? \\n * is * the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements ? \\nis oliver stone still alive , because he cut a deal with george bush to spread * dis * information ? \\nis this movie really about * any * of the crazed cabbie's theories ? \\nno , no , and no . \\nas it turns out , there's some other nonsense going on here , involving and revolving around jerry's background . \\n ( hint : pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out and flashes back , in quick succession , to images of an interrogation room , hypodermic needles , and ms . roberts herself . ) \\nthe * initial * premise is pretty good and is played , for a while , at a delightfully dizzying clip . \\nmel is wider-open that we've ever seen him and , if his character's relationship with roberts' initially strains credibility , their combined star power is blissfully intoxicating . \\n ( the highest wattage of the summer , perhaps ? ) \\neven when the plot contrivances begin to intrude , the two remain a randy dandy screen pair . \\nthere's a great scene in jerry's fortress , er , apartment , with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container . \\n ( which he stores in another locked con- tainer , his fridge . ) \\nother hilarious moments , of which there are many , include a trio of memorable convention-breakers , where alice ditches a tail , jerry cold-cocks someone , and , later , eludes a foot pursuit , each in a uproariously unexpected fashion . \\n ( that's donner's own ladyhawke playing in the theater , btw . ) \\nlet's see , other pleasures include . . . \\na brilliant title sequence , a jazzy score from carter burwell , and the worth-paying-to-see sight of roberts pumping lead into one bad guy and slamming another's head into a wall . \\noh , pretty woman ! \\ngetting to the latter , however , requires slogging through an increasingly overburdened and ultimately unappealing story . \\nthe last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable to torturous to almost unwatchable . \\nmore stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here , except , perhaps , for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts . \\nand here i thought it was wabbit season . \\ngood god , who rewrites these movies ? \\nand do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles ? \\n\",\n"," b\"take a look at the following equation . . . . \\na christmas carol+ghostbusters=scrooged \\nyes , scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment , comedy and horror you would get if you mixed those two elements toghether . \\nscrooged is alternatively sick , gross , funny , and then sickly soppy . \\nbill murray plays frank cross , a t . v executive with a horrible personality . \\nhe's evil to secretary , actors , crew , everyone , except the t . v's station's boss , of course ( played by the late robert mitchum ) however , he is then visited by a very dead exec , who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts , past , present and future ( who is called the ghost of yet to come , for some reason ) sure enough , they arrive , show cross how much of a s . o . b he is , and he changes his way . \\nhowever , throughout this simple plot , we've got to suffer outlandish special effects , poor comedy , and an very , very mean performance from bill murray . \\nfrank cross isn't 'funny' mean , he's just mean . \\nhe also isn't very good at emotional scenes , and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film , with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is , and how he has changed . \\nhowever , the supporting cast are ok , with good performances from mitchum , allen ( who plays his girlfriend ) and john glover ( who plays cross's 'partner' ) the ghost of christmas past isn't that bad either . \\nsadly , though , the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of 'home alone' style violence from the ghost of christmas present , played by carol kane . \\nwhoever thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head with a toaster was funny , should be fired straight away . \\nand the audience also has to suffer bobcat goldthwait ( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3 , if i remeber correctly . . . . ) \\nwho , thankfully , dosen't say much . \\nthe script is horrendous . \\nmichael o'donaghue churns out terrible , bad taste jokes ( which i guess is the whole point really ) then changes direction completely to emotional scenes . \\nand he must of been on some drug when he wrote the final ten minutes , which are awful . \\nthe special effects look nice , but do nothing for the film . \\nthere's some impressive make up effects also . \\nthe music is also good , which is scored by danny elfman . \\nbut great effects and make up don't make a great film . \\nscrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audience , seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of the film are so depressing anyway , and the last ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech . \\nwhy didn't cross just look out his exec window , and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him ? \\noverall , then , you'd have a much better christmas if you avoid this film like something that should be avoided ( perhaps a plague ) \\n\",\n"," b\"there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start . \\nrecommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much . \\na comet is about to strike earth , causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event ( e . l . e . ) that wiped out the dinosaurs . \\nwhat follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world . \\nfirstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid . \\nto be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much ) . \\nmimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted . \\n ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment' . ) \\nit is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives . \\nhowever , the film simply fails on that note . \\nthe effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials . \\nshe's still making good money though . \\nt ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast . \\nbut the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored . \\nrobert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all ) . \\nleoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters . \\nwarning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway )

the logic ? \\nleder could have at least made it plausible with 20 . \\nand then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims . \\nthe film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing . \\ni also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill , even with a motorbike for a head-start . \\nit's unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn't really matter . \\nbuilding caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr . \\nstrangelove' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years . \\nnow that is a more practical use for caves . \\nwhat is the point of living in caves ? \\nthere is no , unlike `dr . \\nstrangelove' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure . \\nhow do plants grow ? \\nif humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there's no reason why they can't do it in the open . \\nthe president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves . \\nobviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media . \\nin an important mission like that of the `messiah' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn't sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres . \\nthis is not deep impact ? it's a frivolous cheap impact . \\nbut even with all

friend\\'s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i\\'d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . \\nit was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend\\'s wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . \\nthe heroine of my best friend\\'s wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o\\'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn\\'t married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . \\nboth julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael\\'s age , julianne realizes that he\\'s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . \\nhowever , she finds herself even more distraught when michael\\'s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . \\nthe setup for my best friend\\'s wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film\\'s storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel\\'s wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend\\'s wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . \\nthe film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . \\nfor example , there\\'s a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen\\'s everyone says i love you ; i\\'d even assert it\\'s a more successful one . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . \\nin a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy\\'s life , she\\'d actually like her too . \\nthe george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend\\'s wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . \\nthroughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . \\nthere is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we\\'re given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . \\nthis isn\\'t the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character\\'s neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . \\neven better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend\\'s weddding . \\nwith a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy\\'s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . \\nshe even sings - i won\\'t soon forget her charming serenade of \" i just don\\'t know what to do with myself \" . \\nrupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . \\nhis george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett\\'s performance is a delight to watch ; he\\'s clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . \\ndermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he\\'s not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . \\nwhen julia roberts\\' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as \" america\\'s sweetheart \" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . \\nwhile that didn\\'t quite work out , it\\'s near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan\\'s reputation as a skilled director of comedy . \\n',\n"," b'bill condon\\'s \" gods and monsters \" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics \" frankenstein \" and \" bride of frankenstein . \" \\nsince i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale\\'s inner fantasies and hallucinations . \\nwhale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . \\nas the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . \\njames whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , \" a dirty old man . \" \\nin one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale\\'s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . \\nbecause of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . \\nclayon agrees , and doesn\\'t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . \\ncertainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . \\n \" gods and monsters \" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a \" motion picture director , \" rather than a \" horror director . \" \\nand in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . \\nit is evident that whale\\'s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . \\nas played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . \\nhe never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . \\nthrough the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . \\nalthough boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people\\'s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . \\nsince whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . \\nalthough an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . \\nit is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the \" on-again-off-again \" friendship at the film\\'s center is fairly predictable . \\nwe know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . \\nin lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . \\nalso , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . \\nif the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . \\n \" gods and monsters \" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . \\nthe film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . \\nwalking away from \" gods and monsters , \" it was ian mckellen\\'s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . \\nit is a sad testament when a person\\'s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else\\'s business in the first place . \\n',\n"," b'the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole . . . \\nand , in the future , it\\'s also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of light by traversing through its own portable black hole . \\nnaturally , this is the setup for the other event horizon . . . \\nthe movie . \\nwhen the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at , just outside of neptune , the crew of the ship called the \" lewis and clark \" has to go to investigate , and dr . william weir , the creator of the \" event horizon , \" gets to come along for the ride . \\nif you\\'ve glanced at a poster for this movie , you know that , supposedly , what follows is \" infinite terror . \" \\nwell , i don\\'t know about the \" terror \" part , but \" infinite \" certainly seems to qualify . . . \\nevent horizon is a mean-spirited , gory , sick excuse for a film . \\nit starts off as an alien rip-off , and then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes . \\nat least for those first 40 minutes it\\'s an * interesting * rip-off of alien . \\nthat\\'s a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie , which seems to go on forever . \\nit not a scary monster movie , nor is it a psychological thriller . \\nit is simply a movie which tries again and again to make the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore . \\nyou\\'ve seen this kind of movie before . \\nthe hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility . \\nthis is a kind of movie for which i have no respect , a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago . \\nit is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore , but event horizon takes the low road , and the viewers pay the price . \\nthere are many good , respectable performances , from fishburne and neill most noticably . \\npaul anderson\\'s direction is impressive , as it was in mortal kombat . \\nthere are many nice special effects , mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero-gravity . \\nthe sets are beautiful to gaze upon . \\nand richard t . jones\\' character ( cooper ) is hilarious and extremely likable ( more so than most characters i\\'ve seen in recent movies ) for the little screen time that he has . \\nand none of this can save the movie from being a d-grade level of film . \\nthe idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls , a life that knows the fears and inner skeletons of the human passengers , is a promising one . \\na haunted house story in space isn\\'t such a bad idea . \\nbut the final execution is extremely disappointing . \\nthat\\'s not to say that philip eisner ( here making his feature film-writing debut ) doesn\\'t have talent . \\nfor those first 40 minutes , he manages to make a tired premise interesting , adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip-off story , and that\\'s something that not too many writers can do . \\nhe even has one scene that , though it also tries to sicken the audience , has a honestly tense feel to it ( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space ) . \\nhe definitely has something of a gift , but it\\'s not fully on display here . \\ni certainly will look forward to seeing more from him , and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent and the story possibilities of the premise . \\nbut because of what this movie degenerates into , i have little or no respect , and got little or no enjoyment , out of it . \\nif this is what we have to look forward to in the future of film , then i agree with laurence fishburne\\'s sentiment - \" god help us . \" \\n',\n"," b\"big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . \\no . j . \\nsimpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers . \\nall these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . \\nand , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . \\nwhether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks . \\nso when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . \\nhowever , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one . \\njohn travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . \\nno one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever . \\nbut , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting . \\na civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . \\ntravolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . \\nhis performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid . \\nif he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average . \\nluckily , he has a strong supporting cast . \\nwilliam h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood . \\nhe continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . \\nin a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant . \\nhe is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . \\nhe is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant . \\nbut , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action . \\nrobert duvall is also an underrated actor . \\nhe gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey . \\nduvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant . \\nduvall is magical in this role . \\nhe is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way . \\nin many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes . \\nunfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) . \\nhowever , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . \\nthis is not the case in a civil action . \\nthey have comedy coming from all sides . \\nwhether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace . \\ngranted , it's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film . \\nthe plot is terrific- somewhat . \\nthe setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . \\nthen the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head . \\nthey find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . \\nhowever , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . \\ni will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film . \\nthe courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . \\nit left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific . \\nall in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film . \\nhis supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta . \\nthe film is smart , witty and thought provoking . \\nnot only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . \\na civil action provides everything a drama lover craves . \\n\",\n"," b'it\\'s not a bad thing to update old stories . \\nit\\'s done all the time in the oral tradition . \\nthe difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed , it\\'s that it\\'s dry . \\nthe new cinderella , danielle ( drew barrymore ) is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come . \\nshe\\'s a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france . \\nwhen her father dies , she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla ( anjelica huston ) . \\nshe works by day , but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night . \\nalthough the story is updated , you know the plot . \\ndanielle meets prince henry ( dougray scott ) , goes to a ball disguised , is later found out and they live happily ever after . \\nthe movie is often like watching a filmed play . \\ntheater in real life is engrossing . \\ntheater on the screen is usually lifeless . \\nthere doesn\\'t seem to be much going on . \\nthe camera can be a star of films . \\nhere it\\'s a co-conspirator . \\ndanielle\\'s convictions are compromised . \\na socialist and a feminist , she pretends to be royalty to get her man . \\na kind woman , her last act in the movie is one of revenge . \\nthe most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish . \\nthe fairy godmother stand-in , leonardo da vinci ( patrick godfrey ) is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle . \\nhuston is enjoyable in her over-the-top wickedness . \\nin all fairness , my companion loved the film . \\nmaybe it\\'s one of those \" chick flicks \" that men don\\'t like . \\nit is certainly a date film . \\nnearly the entire audience was couples . \\noh well , maybe it\\'s good for something . \\n',\n"," b'so ask yourself what \" 8mm \" ( \" eight millimeter \" ) is really all about . \\nis it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ? \\nis it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana , there\\'s a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won\\'t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? \\nor is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ? \\ni\\'m not talking about snuff films , supposed \" documentaries \" of victims being brutalized and killed on camera . \\ni\\'m talking about films like \" 8mm \" and its director , joel schumacher . \\nwith a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- \" batman & robin , \" \" a time to kill , \" \" batman forever , \" \" the client \" --schumacher certainly has that kind of influence . \\nis \" 8mm \" something you really want to see ? \\nprobably not . \\nthe first two-thirds of \" 8mm \" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core . \\nthen , as it\\'s been threatening all along , the film explodes into violence . \\nand just when you think it\\'s finally over , schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further . \\ntrust me . \\nthere are better ways to waste two hours of your life . \\nnicolas \\' \" snake eyes \" \\' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husband\\'s safe documents a young girl\\'s murder . \\nwelles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly , and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly , almost as if you don\\'t need any specialized skills or training to do this . \\nwelles certainly makes it look easy . \\nand cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues . \\nthe deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes , like george c . scott in paul schrader\\'s \" hardcore . \" \\noccasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task . \\nthere are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener , who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa . \\n \" 8mm \" doesn\\'t condemn or condone its subject matter , it just exploits it . \\nthe irony , of course , is that schumacher and \" seven \" scribe andrew kevin walker\\'s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product . \\nso we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror . \\nlater it\\'s the turn of joaquin phoenix ( who\\'s quite good and by far the film\\'s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california ) to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again . \\nall this to get to the familiar yet offensive \" revelation \" that sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me . \\nneither super nor standard , \" 8mm \" is shocking only in its banality . \\n',\n"," b'the spy game is up . \\nyou can thank charlie\\'s angels -- the movie -- for that . \\nwhen did banality and pandering become okay ? \\njust steal from hong kong , the matrix , and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that\\'s a movie ? \\ncharlie\\'s angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i\\'ve seen in ages . \\ncharlie\\'s angels is dumb . \\njust plain dumb . \\nas we all know , three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore , cameron diaz , and lucy liu -- are three super-agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie . \\nthey all drive fast cars , look oh-so-fabulous even in the morning , and don\\'t seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men , having buildings explode ten feet in front of them , or flying through the air in matrix slow-motion . \\nand while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage-busting wetsuits , cleavage-busting waitress uniforms , and cleavage-busting wet t-shirts , they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying , drunk sorority girls , the kind who hit on everybody at a party . \\nthe actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company . \\nof course , the rival wants control of his new personal identification system , which involves such latter-day buzzwords as gps , cellular tracking , and even mainframe . \\nthe amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round-robin matrix rip-off ( again ) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the angels\\' hair . \\nthe coup de grace is bill murray as bosley , serving as charlie\\'s manservant , or , more to the point , the angels\\' pimp . \\nthe rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc , enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables , carbon-copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft , and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke\\'s long-lost brother . \\ncharlie\\'s angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight . \\nnothing is difficult , plausible , or believable in any of the angels\\' actions . \\nit feels like the matrix , mission : impossible 2 , and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one . \\ndiaz is a knucklehead . \\nbarrymore is the \" dangerous one , \" mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role . \\nliu is just . . . \\nlucy liu , looking good in a skin-tight black leather suit . \\nthe list of movies from which charlie\\'s angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing . \\nthe writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon , lethal weapon ii , all of jackie chan\\'s movies , the great escape , saturday night fever , revenge of the nerds , payback , darkman , dr . no , the matrix ( as mentioned ) , and even tv\\'s friends . \\nit\\'s a shame , too , because one of the many screenwriters , john august , was at the helm of last year\\'s favorite , go . \\nthen again , what can you expect from a director known solely as \" mcg . \" \\nthere is no camp value in the film , no interesting main characters , no invigorating action scenes , no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting players . \\nnote to hollywood : next time , let\\'s leave the tv shows on the tv . \\n',\n"," b'capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ? \\nstarship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that . \\nit is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it\\'s so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed . \\nit\\'s one of the worst movies i\\'ve seen in a long time . \\nwhy am i calling this movie pornography ? \\npornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts . \\ni remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as \" a near-pornographic eternity \" . \\ni didn\\'t agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout \" do \\'er , man , do \\'er ! \" \\nthat sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers . \\nit\\'s * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk . \\nit tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening . \\nthe film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn\\'t appear to have intelligence . \\nto counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they\\'re clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles . \\nthis isn\\'t heinlein , it\\'s a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome . \\n ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . ) \\nthe soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic . \\nthey do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense . \\nthey don\\'t even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we don\\'t care about them . \\nwe hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate . \\nhere , we don\\'t even hate the bugs -- what\\'s there to hate ? \\nhating them would be like cursing a hurricaine . \\nif there\\'s anything really hateful there , the movie doesn\\'t know how to give it to us . \\nthe screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be \" screen typist \" ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other . \\none of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who\\'s great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again . \\nonce or twice is fine . \\nby the fifth or sixth time , it\\'s worn out its welcome . \\nthere\\'s never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle . \\nalso , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . \\nif a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing . \\nbut if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip . \\nuh-huh . \\nthe very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor . \\ni say \" quasi- \" because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie doesn\\'t have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject . \\nthe bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison . \\nlike the rest of the movie . \\nthere\\'s more , i suppose , but it\\'s not worth it . \\nthe acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid . \\nthe heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece . \\n',\n"," b'capsule : the best place to start if you\\'re a jackie chan newcomer . \\nroars along , never stops for breath , and frequently hilarious . \\nto talk about jackie chan as a \" stuntman \" is to miss a million things . \\njackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today , but also a very funny guy . \\nhe reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to make me laugh -- he\\'s funny just standing there , copping a look . \\nsupercop has jackie making us laugh , scream , duck , root , and gasp for breath , often all in the same scene . \\nit\\'s actually the third in a loosely related series of movies , each with jackie playing kevin chan , a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neck-deep into trouble and then karate-kicking his way out of it . \\n ( the others are also worth seeing . ) \\nit\\'s a little slow to start , but once it gets moving , it\\'s a field day . \\nthe movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind . \\nkevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china , which requires him to collaborate with the attractive ( and ass-kicking ) chief fo chinese security ( played here by the ever-enjoyable michelle yeoh ) . \\nthere\\'s a fun chemistry between the two of them , especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform . \\nkevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail -- all undercover , of course -- and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss . \\nthe drug boss , however , has problems of his own : his wife\\'s on trial for many of his own crimes , and she\\'s got the key to an account with all of his drug funds . \\nthis means , of course , endless trouble -- not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he\\'s out in the field , and she sees him with this other woman , and . . . but that\\'s one of the movie\\'s unique pleasures : the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly . \\naction . there is , of course , non-stop action in this movie -- everything from one-on-one kung fu to all-out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines ( ! ) \\noutrunning the hong kong coast guard . \\nthere is also a virtuoso climax , which features , among other things , jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter , a wrong-way freeway chase ( which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt ) , a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the \\'copter as well as a motorcycle . \\nyou get the idea . \\nthis is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food : quick , enjoyable ,

ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast . \\neddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck . \\nliving in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) . \\nmaureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie's frequent disappearances . \\non his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love . \\ntheir manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again . \\nlike a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high . \\ntheir relationship is further complicated by maureen's pregnancy . \\nshe wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter . \\nduring one of eddie's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy . \\nshe leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer . \\nshe lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage . \\nhe lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years . \\nduring this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) . \\nher life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her . \\njoey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life . \\nshe chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey ) . \\nbut the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was . \\nmaureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him . \\nperhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing . \\n\",\n"," b'roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , \" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . \\nben kingsley ? \" \\nmy response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . \\nthey should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . \\nthe same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . \\nthat is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . \\ngary \" gal \" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . \\nlife has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . \\nbut his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . \\nthe first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . \\nthe second punch comes from gal\\'s past . \\nback in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv\\'s lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . \\nhe sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . \\ndon will accept any decision gal makes from \" yes \" to \" certainly . \" \\nhowever , if gal says \" no \" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy\\'s ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . \\nin the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody\\'s skin . \\nkingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . \\nthere are some serious problems in louis mellis\\'s and david scinto\\'s script that should have been caught before filming . \\nwhen we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . \\nbeyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . \\nany local hood could have done what gal is needed for . \\nadditionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . \\nno only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . \\nin spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . \\ni know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . \\nthe story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . \\nthe old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . \\nit is not a great plot . \\nin sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . \\nperhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . \\nit is an old plot dressed up to look new . \\nif the plot is old , at least the style is creative . \\nthis is director jonathan glazer\\'s first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . \\nhis style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . \\ncinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . \\nwe see one side of a person\\'s faces . \\nbut the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . \\nhalf of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . \\nus yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . \\nat least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . \\nsexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . \\nthe plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . \\nfurther respectability comes from ben kingsley\\'s high-powered performance . \\ni give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n"," b' \" jack frost , \" is one of those dumb , corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film , but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching . \\nthis does not come as a surprise , since the studio that made it is warner brothers , who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other . \\njack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife , gabby ( kelly preston ) , and 11-year-old son , charlie ( joseph cross ) , but doesn\\'t spend nearly enough time with them . \\nwhen he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play , he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas . \\nhalfway there , jack has second thoughts , but on his way back home , is in a car accident and dies . \\nswitch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack\\'s death . \\nwhen charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died , the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack\\'s spirit . \\njack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him , but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise . \\n \" frosty the snowman , \" is a classic cartoon , and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated , but as a live-action film , it doesn\\'t work at all . \\nafter a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established , \" jack frost , \" quickly goes downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play . \\nsince jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , \" what happens after you die ? \" \\nor , \" how does it feel to be a snowman ? \" \\nbut instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie . \\nthe performances are respectable enough , but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this . \\nmichael keaton at least got off easy , since he disappears after the first twenty minutes , but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ? \\ni have always liked kelly preston . \\nshe is clearly a talented , charismatic actress , but has never been given a good role in her life , usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character , as in , 1997\\'s , \" nothing to lose , \" and , \" addicted to love . \" \\njoseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast , since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent . \\nin one of the only subplots that actually works , due to its wittiness , henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman . \\nthis brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side , however , by the tried-and-true main plot at hand , which is the sappy story of a father and son . \\nsince i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe-inducing lines of dialogue . \\nsome of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : \" you da man , \" says charlie . \\n \" no , i da snowman , \" replies jack . \\nor how about this little zinger , coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out : \" snowdad is better than no dad . \" \\ndo people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ? \\nthe snowman , created by john henson\\'s creature shop , is more believable than the snowman from last year\\'s unintentionally hilarious direct-to-video horror flick , also called , \" jack frost , \" but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects . \\neither way , it was an awful lot of work to go through , just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project . \\nas a seasonal holiday picture , \" jack frost , \" is pretty much a clunker . \\na better christmas film from this year is , \" i\\'ll be home for christmas . \" \\nbetter yet , my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film , such as , \" it\\'s a wonderful life , \" \" a christmas story , \" or , \" prancer . \" \\n \" jack frost , \" is an earnest , but severely misguided film , and children , as well as adults , deserve better . \\ni doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent , anyway . \\n',\n"," b\"back in 1980s , chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films . \\nhe couldn't , of course , top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados . \\nthat quantity was mostly provided by cannon group , prolific production company that dominated the b-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap , formulaic and , more often than not , unwatchable genre products . \\nthe hitman , 1991 action thriller directed by chuck's brother aaron , is one of the last among them . \\nchuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which shouldn't surprise anyone , considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks , specialised for roles of usually very mean characters ) . \\nsurviving the shooting , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent . \\nhe infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - italians , french canadians and iranians . \\nsince it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris , at least not in this kind of movie , the biggest attraction of this film should have been action . \\nwell , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring , repetitive and not at all exciting . \\nit is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films . \\nwe know very little about norris' character while , on the other hand , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension . \\nin the end we almost feel sorry for them , since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade . \\nduring the film , somebody obviously became aware of that problem , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris . \\nthat caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation . \\nthe photography in this film is dark , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it . \\n\",\n"," b'based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won\\'t bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) . \\ncan you say . . . the \\nthird times not a charm ? \\nplot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation\\'s top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week . \\ncritique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture . \\nwhen you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that\\'s not a very good sign . \\ni also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes . \\nwhen you consider that the other \" part \" of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign . \\nand when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this \" big \" summer blockbuster . \\nit blows . \\nor as they say in french , \" eet blows \" . \\ncould it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ? \\nmaybe . \\ncould it be that most of the special effects don\\'t show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don\\'t see anything that its trailers hadn\\'t already given away ? \\nperhaps . \\nor could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? \\nnaaaaaaah ! \\na bad movie is a bad movie . \\non a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in . \\nbranagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that\\'s pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped . \\nsmith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others . \\ni would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie . \\nthen again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh \\nyeah , but the rest of the movie sucked . \\nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997\\'s summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996\\'s independence day ( 6/10 ) . \\nhe once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career . \\nkevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 . \\nthey have two kids together , greta simone and owen . \\none of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has \" kasdan \" written on it . \\nlawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss . \\nsalma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english . \\nshe made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders\\' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez\\'s desperado opposite antonio banderas . \\nsince then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez\\'s films . \\nshe stands 5\\'2 \" , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother . \\none of the actresses cast as branagh\\'s lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) . \\nanother is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world\\'s most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper\\'s bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle . \\n',\n"," b'post-chasing amy , a slew of love-triangle movies : this month we have kissing a fool , co-starring amy\\'s own lee , and april brings us the object of my affection , which may as well be titled chasing allan , for it is the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate . \\n ( to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it , that film stars schwimmer\\'s friend jennifer aniston . ) \\nif only kevin smith could write them all . . . \\nschwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max , who falls in love with his best friend jay ( lee ) \\'s book editor samantha ( avital ) a mere twenty-four hours after meeting her . \\nthey are soon engaged , and max , because of his own raging libido , grows suspicious of samantha\\'s fidelity . \\nhe convinces jay to flirt with samantha during the development of his book , to \" test her \" . \\nthe trouble is , jay might be secretly in love with her . \\nto stretch this flat , sitcom premise to feature length , the plot is framed by a climactic wedding , at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale--the events leading up to the nuptials--to an annoying fat man and his silly girlfriend . \\nhunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film ; schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue ; and lee , poor lee , is miscast . \\nso hysterically funny in chasing amy , here he is forced to repress his comic instincts : to swear , to yell , to talk about oral sex . . . \\nthe script\\'s idea of a character trait is to stress that jay is a \" sensitive man \" , and then show him drinking pepto bismol when he\\'s stewing over his girl trouble . \\nas for avital , an israeli actress , she is warm and sweet , but we don\\'t know anything about her character other than that it takes her an incredibly long time to realize the most obvious things . \\nshe also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer , who plays schwimmer\\'s assistant and personal temptress , turning that particular subplot into an unintentional riff on vertigo . \\nthere are a handful , a smattering , of good scenes in kissing a fool . \\ni enjoyed a moment in a comedy club , during which jay gets up and asks \" has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her ? \" \\nover and over until he\\'s booted off stage . \\nthere are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that\\'s on the page . \\nkissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke-machine friends that spawned schwimmer\\'s movie career , so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back . \\n',\n"," b'way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad . \\none of the good ones is ryan phillippe\\'s surprisingly halfway decent performance . \\nafter the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year\\'s cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he\\'d fallen for his \" target \" . \\nit was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film\\'s director could negotiate . \\nbut he seems to be trying and that shouldn\\'t be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn\\'t required to do much but look pretty . \\nhere , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his \" look here , see \" glory . \\nit\\'s tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion . \\nunlike ben affleck\\'s puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that . \\nas for the plot , well , that\\'s one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she\\'s carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man . \\nthe kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed . \\nbut the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit . \\ndirected by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity . \\nunlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn\\'t seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i\\'ve seen before and worse , it feels like it . \\nthe film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is . \\nit features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life . \\neven attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc . i didn\\'t like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it\\'s even more self consciously \" dramatic \" . \\nusual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending . \\nnowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential . \\nthus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn\\'t see it coming , and i smiled . \\nhowever most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason . \\nor substance . \\nit\\'s just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be . \\neven the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like \" karma is only justice with out the satisfaction \" are clever . \\nat one point caan laments \" need is the ultimate monkey \" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said \" love is like hippo ass \" . \\ni\\'ve seen porno with better dialogue . \\nand some with better plot lines too . \\nbut rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ) . \\ncaan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness . \\nbenicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering . \\nspeaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose . \\nnicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he\\'s only kept around for his cold presence . \\ntaye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene . \\nfor the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo\\'s ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns . \\nit\\'s vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about \" faggots \" migrating to los angeles . \\nyou know the routine . \\nthe final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at . \\nbut those gun shots sure crack like thunder . \\njust the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry\\'s fetishized smith and wesson . \\noh how far we\\'ve come . \\n',\n"," b'steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for \" the new yorker , \" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . \\nmuch of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called \" in search of the wily filipino . \" \\nnow , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( \\'everything being made now is crap\\' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood . \\nmartin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned . \\nhis accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called \" chubby rain , \" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops . \\nbowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america\\'s top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star . \\nramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously . \\nhe sends his cast members ( who aren\\'t in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey\\'s table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance . \\nthe paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time . \\nramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities . \\n ( as if that\\'s not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) \\nwhen he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble \" white code \" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in . \\nmurphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey\\'s adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage . \\nalways surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself . \\nfurthermore , consider the enemies he\\'ll make of popular scientologists . \\npacing stricter\\'s neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly . \\nmurphy\\'s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta \" clearing . \" \\nnot that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin\\'s invention . \\nhis script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry . \\n ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . ) \\nmartin\\'s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder\\'s point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture . \\nas expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin\\'s crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading \" cahiers du cinema , \" or martin\\'s nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) . \\nmost of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen . \\nbowfinger\\'s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath . \\nwe\\'re also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem \" chubby rain , \" z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush . \\n ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz\\'s last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . ) \\nthese are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece . \\nas i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham\\'s character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . \\nthat said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome . \\nmartin gets sentimental by story\\'s end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ? \\nfor those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world . \\n',\n"," b'i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars . \\nfrom my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet\\'s film was intense and clever at times but boring and

or chinatown , begs for the viewer\\'s complete attention . \\nmiss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film . \\nalso like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending . \\nmamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games . \\nlike his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim . \\nbecause we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film . \\nmamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end . \\nthe power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious . \\nthe spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued . \\nafter seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening . \\nhis direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them . \\nthe story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative \" process \" that everyone is trying to get their hands on . \\nsoon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his \" process . \" \\nthrough his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross\\' boss mr . klein . \\nplayed by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role . \\nthe most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott\\'s joe ross . \\nthe character\\'s transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable . \\ndavid mamet\\'s script is so interesting because we know people don\\'t actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them . \\nhis beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge . \\nthis is a must see , for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie . \\n',\n"," b\"while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) . \\nso here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival . \\nstrait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life . \\nwith the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ? \\neasy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as . \\nso instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends . \\ndirector alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot . \\nuntil then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging . \\nthat said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it . \\nthe introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) . \\none wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for . \\nnot surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty . \\nthe same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ . \\nwhatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go . \\n_dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through . \\nas it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . . \\nlike a zombie . \\n\",\n"," b' \" spawn \" features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster . \\nit not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys , it appears to have been made by them . \\nin a classic example of telling and not showing , \" spawn \" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how \" men are the ones who create evil on earth . \" \\nso much for a message . \\nthe movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant . \\nsimmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil\\'s army to overtake the world , he\\'ll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) . \\nof course , seeing as how five years has passed , wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons\\' partner ( d . b . \\nsweeney ) . \\nhis , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan\\'s . \\nclown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn . \\nwynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart -- when it stops beating , major cities around the world will detonate , causing the leak of a disease that \" makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash . \" \\nphew . got all that ? \\nit would be easy to dismiss \" spawn \" as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics , but it doesn\\'t even work on that level . \\nthe computer-generated sequences are often and plenty , and the problem is that they look too computer-generated . \\nthe several scenes set in hell present a devil that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- with the movie\\'s healthy budget you\\'d think they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks . \\nother elements of the movie are so-so ; spawn\\'s enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , but it\\'s too obvious when he\\'s being played by a costumed actor or an image . \\nin movies like \" contact , \" the special effects serve the story . \\nin \" spawn , \" they are the story . \\nand spawn himself isn\\'t even an interesting character . \\nthe film\\'s reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for , but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped . \\nwhat we need is a batman , a luke skywalker . \\neven watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn . \\npoor leguizamo . \\nhe starred in february\\'s \" the pest , \" a movie that i still think is the year\\'s worst so far , although this one does give it a run for its money . \\nas clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline . \\nleguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon . \\nthe guy was brilliant in \" to wong foo , thanks for everything ! \\njulie newmar . \" \\nwhat is he doing wasting his talent in this and \" the pest \" ? \\ni\\'m one of the few people that liked \" batman & robin , \" this summer\\'s other big-budget comic book film . \\nyet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison , i can only hope people will change their minds and think of \" batman \" as the superior adaptation . \\nthere\\'s a compelling story somewhere in \" spawn \" -- including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it\\'s just not found anywhere near here . \\nas it is , \" spawn \" is just awful -- it stinks worse than a dead trout . \\n',\n"," b' \" spice world \" is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls . \\nsure there\\'s a hint of humor in there every once in a while . \\nactually , there\\'s a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls . \\nbut overall , who cares ? \\nnot me . \\nif you don\\'t know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood . \\nin \" spice world \" they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews . \\namazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money . \\nand they keep babbling about \" girl power \" when they should really be talking about \" cleavage power \" . \\ni mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ? \\nthe film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you\\'d have yourself one raunchy adult film . \\nby the way , there\\'s something in the opening credits which says \" based on an idea by the spice girls \" . \\nwow , they got idea credit ! \\ni certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . . \\ngiving credit for simply having the thought \" say girls , let\\'s make a movie ! \" \\nthe supporting cast fares well . \\nroger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche-spewing \" chief \" of the spice girls , and darn it all , he\\'s fun to watch . \\nmark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band\\'s manager ( richard e . grant ) . \\none question though : george wendt ? \\nyou\\'d think that \" spice world \" would envoke one of two reactions in people . \\nif you like the spice girls , you\\'ll like them even more afterwards . \\nand if you can\\'t stand them ( like me ) , then \" spice world \" will really make you sick . \\noddly , the audience i saw the film with , roughly 50 twelve year-old girls , sat in silence for the entire film . \\nwell , not the two who sat directly behind me . \\nthey kept muttering \" this is stupid \" over and over again . \\nmaybe there is hope for humanity after all . \\n[pg] \\n',\n"," b'my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free . \\nas lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book . \\n ( \" without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . \" ) \\nlanguidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending . \\nsince it\\'s rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery . \\nother than a few nice visuals , there\\'s nothing to recommend the picture . \\nwith great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he\\'s more than the world\\'s best oscar host . \\nhe does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year\\'s father\\'s day and this year\\'s my giant . \\none wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project . \\nsurely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there . \\nperhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success . \\nor maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie\\'s somber tone . \\nthe most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day . \\nthis one-joke movie\\'s single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible . \\nsammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) . \\nafter throwing out constant one-liners ( \" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . \" ) , \\nsammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket . \\nand although he doesn\\'t like it , he\\'s willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs . \\n ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . ) \\nafter a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie . \\nwe learn that max\\'s condition is terminal , and he will soon die . \\nto be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers . \\nlet\\'s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie . \\nmy giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 . \\nit is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up . \\nmy son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it . \\nmatthew pointed out that it \" is not as good as it could have been or should have been . \" \\n ( amen . ) \\nhe went on to comment that he did not like the way the movie changed completely in the middle . \\njeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was . \\n',\n"," b' \" desperate measures \" is a generic title for a film that\\'s beyond generic . \\nit\\'s also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more \" before and after \" than \" reversal of fortune . \" \\nthe movie is a big disappointment , and yet it\\'s somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing . \\ntoo bad the execution\\'s all wrong , though , because the set-up of \" desperate measures \" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use . \\nsan francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission . \\neven worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society . \\nconnor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he\\'s at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital . \\nwhen he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy . \\none misstep \" desperate measures \" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt\\'s illness . \\nwhat\\'s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow . \\ntake , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital . \\nthe police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ? \\nhe shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight . \\nconnor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son . \\nwhatever . \\nto be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie\\'s problems . \\nfirst and foremost is how cheaply \" desperate measures \" trades the potential of it\\'s opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour . \\nonce mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills . \\nthere are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away . \\nalso , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia\\'s frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; \" desperate measures \" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie\\'s head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this . \\nthere is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department . \\ncast against type , michael keaton\\'s understated menace is highly effective . \\nalthough he\\'s not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord . \\njoseph cross , as garicia\\'s ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos . \\nthis cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost . \\nit goes without saying that \" desperate measures \" needs an operation of its very own . \\n',\n"," b\"i guess there are those who have never been kissed before ( a rare and dying breed ) , except if you're child ? in which case it would be called experimenting . \\nrarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties . \\nhardest to believe still , is that drew barrymore has never been kissed . \\ndespite all these hard to believe tit bits , there are people out there who have never truly been kissed , and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet , sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling , reassuring them that their search for true love is over . \\nwell , this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life . \\nand it's sweet . \\ndrew barrymore who shone in ? ever after' is wonderful as ? josie , grossy' , the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor , before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter . \\nit addresses the issues of how a dweeb , becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting . \\nhard to believe , but possible . \\nthere may also be those who have been kissed before , but in fact , never truly been given the kiss . \\nso this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it . \\neither way , it is one enjoyable sit , with a fairytale ending . \\n\",\n"," b'time bandits , from director terry gilliam , is a very different fantasy action/adventure movie about a group of time-traveling dwarves , led by randall ( david rappaport ) , who have stolen a map of the universe . \\nthis map contains time hole , that , if exploited , enable the men to travel back and forth through time . \\nthe supreme being of the universe ( ralph richardson ) is the former employer of these treasure-seeking bandits , and he wishes desperately to regain the map . . \\nduring the travels , he appears as a ghostly face , demanding that they return the map that they have stolen . \\nbut , according to randall , they are just \" borrowing \" it . \\nkevin , a young boy who seems quite bored with his life , is unexpectedly brought into the schemes of the little men when they appear in his room , which has a portal for time traveling . \\nhe joins up with the men and becomes part of their gang , following them on their robberies . \\ntheir first victim is napoleon ( ian holm ) , whom they rob during a battle that he is commanding . \\nfrom here , the group travels to the middle ages , meeting up with robin hood himself . \\neventually , kevin is separated from the group and travels to an egyptian time where he is taken in by king agamemnon , played by sean connery . \\nkevin accidentally saved the king\\'s life , and the king wishes to have kevin as his son . \\nbut the group of bandits find kevin and transport onto the deck of the titanic . \\nmeanwhile , the evil genius ( david warner ) is watching the group from fortress of ultimate darkness , attempting to find a way in order to bring the men , and the map , to him . \\nwhen randall learns of the fortress of ultimate darkness , which supposedly contains \" the most fabulous object in the world \" , the dollar signs seemingly appear on his eyes , as he is convinced that they must travel there . \\nonce inside the fortress of ultimate darkness , it is unclear as to if any of the men will make it out alive . \\ntime bandits is a fantastically made film that caters to the imagination of anyone . \\nwith a terrific soundtrack , courtesy of george harrison , whom also was an executive producer , time bandits is sure to be a very surrealistic , time-traveling adventure with unforgettable characters that is sure to entertain anyone . \\nterry gilliam , however , does not utilize that greatly his trademark ability in moviemaking during this film , although this does not affect the film that greatly . \\nand finally , if you liked labyrinth , you\\'ll love time bandits . \\n',\n"," b'i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago . \\ni guess my memory really sucks . \\nthere is very , very little that is funny in caddyshack . \\nthe laughs are few , and far between , and what there are really aren\\'t that great . \\ncaddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club . \\nmichael o\\'keefe plays said caddy . \\nwhy they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera . \\nthe only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course . \\nmost of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success . \\nbill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted . \\nthe biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn\\'t even crack a smile on my face with his character\\'s lame zen-like approach to golfing . \\nthere are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie . \\ni guess that\\'s what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid . \\ni\\'m not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of , but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper . \\nnothing about this movie works . \\nit wouldn\\'t have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn\\'t going to fly . \\nmost of the scenes just couldn\\'t possibly be funny . \\nit\\'s as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world . \\ni\\'m sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny . \\nin reality , they were painfully embarrassing to watch . \\nthere is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the \" hot babe \" of the movie walking by in her bikini . \\nolive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl . \\neverything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned . \\nmaybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny . \\nbut for the rest of us , stay the hell away from caddyshack . \\n',\n"," b\"carry on at your convenience is all about the goings-on in the factory of a toilet manufacturer , wc boggs ( kenneth williams ) . \\nonce they have won an order to manufacture 1000 bidets in two months and charles coote ( charles hawtrey ) has designed a suitable model , the factory employees set to work but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner ( kenneth cope ) and friend bernie hulke ( bernard bresslaw ) who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext . \\nmeanwhile , chief foreman sid plummer ( sid james ) is growing tired of his wife beattie ( hattie jacques ) and her budgie . \\nhe would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore ( joan sims ) but once he discovers that the budgie can predict the winners of horse races , he is over the moon and flush with money . \\nhis daughter , myrtle plummer ( jacki piper ) , is going out with wc's son lewis boggs ( richard o'callaghan ) and this causes conflict on the staff day out to the seaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions . \\nin the end , if the strike does not cease , boggs will have to close down his factory , but the support of a group of women led by coote's wife-to-be and spanner's mother , agatha spanner ( renee houston ) , try to resolve the situation . \\nalso , sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing but trouble since it started predicting horse race winners . \\nthere are some good performances , as usual , from sid james and kenneth williams in their standard roles . \\ncharles hawtrey is third billing but only appears in a few scenes . \\nhis part is mildly amusing . \\nrichard o'callaghan is appealing as bogg's stuck-up son , patsy rowlands is funny as miss withering , bogg's assistant , and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha . \\nhowever , sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer . \\nalthough her character is not directly involved with the main storyline , she manages to input a great deal of pathos and feeling into her character . \\na marvellous performance from a marvellous actress . \\nthe film suffers from annoying performances by bernard bresslaw and especially kenneth cope . \\nin his carry on debut , cope overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny . \\njoan sims returns as the love interest ( instead of barbara windsor ) . \\nsims' 'usual' part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques . \\nadditionally , bill maynard as fred moore is very poor . \\nthis carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer : - the locations and wealth of characters are appealing . \\nhowever , the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired . \\nthis movie does not know where it is going . \\nit was made in 1971 and talbot rothwell the scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for 'bluer' jokes or to maintain the 'innocent' jokes success of most of its predecessors . \\nthat is why this film suffers . \\na minor carry on film whose major asset is the performance by hattie jacques . \\nthe new 'minor-regulars' such as o'callaghan and piper are not able to enliven the movie and the toilet humour becomes humourless after a while . \\n\",\n"," b'watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute \\'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey . \\nif the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star . \\nalas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs . \\nwhat that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars . \\nthat\\'s pretty generous , considering the movie\\'s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek . \\nwhen will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it . \\nso why such a seemingly high rating ? \\nthere are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . \\nfirst , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . \\nthe sound and screen kicked ass . \\nnobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don\\'t necessarily mean that in a good way ) . \\nalso , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie\\'s tension . \\ni even liked the computer-generated settings . \\ni usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i\\'ve seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . \\nalso , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . \\nwilliam hurt isn\\'t too bad either . \\nneither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . \\nand perhaps i shouldn\\'t admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . \\nthere is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a \" real \" kiss -- no sex ) . \\nit felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . \\nthose movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . \\nthat type of moviemaking is a lost art . \\nnow for the bad news . \\nworst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . \\nit\\'s squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \\n \" you better hold on to your joystick , \" is one such line . \\nand when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . \\nsecond worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . \\nthe story\\'s exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what\\'s happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . \\nonce the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . \\nwhen gary oldman easily reprograms will\\'s pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : \" he flipped the switch to \\'evil . \\' \" \\nthen there\\'s the tone of the movie . \\nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . \\nthen it could be an adventure movie . \\nthey\\'re mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn\\'t a good enough actor to carry it off . \\nstill , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . \\njust because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn\\'t mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who\\'s the center of a family . \\nmany quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . \\nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . \\nin star wars , the rebels were the good guys . \\nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . \\nin lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . \\nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . \\nfinally , a few specific details deserve criticism . \\nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . \\nwhy ? \\nwhy bother saying what year this is . \\njust tell us it\\'s the future . \\ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \\nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won\\'t be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \\nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \\nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny\\'s barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven\\'t learned a thing about ergonomics . \\none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \\nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \\nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \\nbut if that\\'s the best part of the movie , i can\\'t in good conscience recommend it . \\nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards . \\n',\n"," b'the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films . \\none was _gattaca_ . \\nthe other was _the thirteenth floor_ . \\njust as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_ . \\nhowever , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_ . \\na cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered . \\nhis associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery . \\nalong the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture . \\n_the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise . \\nthe result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view . \\nfirst , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline . \\nsecond and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel . \\nno wonder it fell through the cracks . \\ndone in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels . \\nmany audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment . \\ni recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie . \\ndespite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller . \\nin that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever . \\nthe moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging . \\nin its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane\\'s husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one . \\nalthough there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep-seated character flaw . \\nin fact , hannon fuller\\'s activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane\\'s husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters . \\nthis is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil . \\nthe tragedy is not in their stars , but in themselves . \\nthe major actors , all of whom are required to play two or even three roles , perform extremely well . \\nbierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ , is outstanding . \\nd\\'onofrio as whitney , who plays a pivotal role in support , also turns in a good performance . \\nthe lovely gretchen mol , whose elegance , integrity , and determination suggest bergman in _casablanca_ , does a wonderful job . \\nher voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times . \\nthis could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script . \\nsome minor flaws , hairline cracks in fine porcelain , appear in places . \\nthere are one or two instances of jerky editing . \\nthe script takes the edge off the film\\'s climaxes . \\nthe atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times ( yet , there is a clue there too ) . \\none wonders if even after two decades , _blade runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci-fi films . \\none can see a group of suits in their suite , waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in _amadeus_ : \" make it more like_blade runner_ , you know , dark and rainy . \" \\n_the thirteen floor_ is that rare exception among hollywood movies : a , rich , emotionally satisfying , intelligent sci-fi movie . \\nand yet , ultimately , it proves the suits right . \\nfor when good sci-fi is made , where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it ? \\nif we don\\'t support great sf , who will ? \\n',\n"," b'senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far . \\ndirector penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies . \\nmarlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage . \\nhowever , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up . \\nin fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet . \\nbut there may be a light at the end of that tunnel . \\nhe signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university\\'s dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) . \\nas a result , his senses are magnified tenfold . \\nusing his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) . \\nnaturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor . \\nthe problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there\\'s not much that\\'s funny here . \\nthe film has it\\'s one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor . \\nthere obviously wasn\\'t much thought put into the plot . \\nthe entire job selection process is completely ridiculous . \\ni mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ? \\nand is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ? \\nto give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl\\'s roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) . \\napparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie . \\nhis \" intervention \" scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh . \\nand then there\\'s the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one . \\nin this case , the object of darryl\\'s amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won\\'t have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses . \\nneedless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film . \\nthis is a film that desperately needed something else . \\nbe that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground . \\nas it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can\\'t help marlon wayans get this one off the ground . \\n',\n"," b'before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen . \\nthis is a very important note because allen\\'s films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone . \\ni know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol\\' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again . \\ni love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s . \\nin fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me ! \\nif you look at the quality of those films , you\\'ll hear what i\\'m saying . \\nthe only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives . \\nin fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some \" time off \" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn\\'t appear as though he has any intention of doing that . \\nso here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old . \\nplot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator . \\nhis methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date . \\na new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency . \\nthe two do not like each other . \\none night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control . \\nsoon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer . \\ncritique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline . \\non the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy . \\nthe sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man . \\nbut it wasn\\'t not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick . \\ni also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron\\'s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) . \\nof course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn\\'t his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude . \\nhe actually plays a \" macho \" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he\\'s hypnotized . \\nbut the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly \" sick of seeing \" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) . \\nanyway , she\\'s really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn\\'t miss a beat of allen\\'s fast-paced dialogue . \\ni didn\\'t care much for her running joke about him \" dying \" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum , \\nyum ! \\nharumph , but i digress . \\nso let\\'s recap . \\na great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn\\'t expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around . \\ni can\\'t say that this is even remotely close to any of allen\\'s best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through . \\nit\\'s probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , \" old-school \" kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion . \\nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : annie hall ( 10/10 ) - celebrity ( 5/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - husbands and wives ( 9/10 ) - mighty aphrodite ( 5/10 ) - small time crooks ( 7/10 ) - when harry met

given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere . \\nin the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech . \\nat least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . \\nshe has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . \\ndrugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . \\nbut this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . \\nin this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . \\neven the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . \\nthe film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . \\nit is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . \\nthe title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . \\nwith julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . \\nhe becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . \\nthe girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship . \\nit especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home . \\nthings go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . \\nit seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . \\nthis scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . \\nbut i doubt that . \\nthe family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . \\nlucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl . \\nthe beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . \\nkate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . \\nthe background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . \\nthe only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . \\nthe family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . \\nthat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . \\nit will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . \\nhe is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . \\nthe new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . \\nthe film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . \\nthe storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . \\nher knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . \\nshe perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . \\nafter all , the mystical trip is the journey . \\nthe film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . \\nbilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . \\nthe little girls are precocious but they are lovable . \\njulia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . \\nshe was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at . \\nthis is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . \\nand , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was ! \\n\",\n"," b'the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate . \\npeople are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future . \\nafter a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds . \\nthe basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth . \\nthe things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element . \\nthe plot in this movie really isn\\'t that important to the thing though . \\nthis movie has very good special effects , for the most part . \\nthe techno-ish music in the background fits the mood very well . \\nbruce willis is an illegal taxi-cab driver in a futuristic new york city . \\none day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk . \\nthis movie is about what happens . \\nthe plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations . \\nalso there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end . \\nsome characters are just plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag . \\nbruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does . \\nthe movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down . \\nit is one of those sci-fi films where you\\'ll be saying \" cool \" followed by a \" what the hell ? ! ? ! \" . \\ni give the fifth element . \\n',\n"," b'driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story . \\nit\\'s a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film . \\nbut if you\\'re patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy . \\ndriving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry\\'s pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago . \\nthe play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union . \\nuhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza . \\nthe film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur . \\nthe movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action . \\nin fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn\\'t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together . \\nrather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on . \\nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta\\'s history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city\\'s oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr . \\nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway . \\nthe insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur . \\nfreeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke . \\nthe film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger . \\ndriving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it\\'s about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon . \\ndaisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur . \\ninitially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere . \\nonce she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver . \\nto make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand . \\neventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke\\'s good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him . \\ntandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace . \\nwe\\'ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon . \\nnevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own . \\nfreeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances . \\nthere is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color . \\nhoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior . \\nboth freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma . \\nthey flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves . \\nthey bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie\\'s gentle humor . \\nat the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama . \\nin his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy\\'s loving and patient son . \\ndrama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) . \\nthe only other significant characters in the film are daisy\\'s housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( \" good times \" ) , and boolie\\'s pretentious wife , played by patti lupone . \\nunder the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again . \\nbut fortunately , beresford never forgets he\\'s shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes . \\nin adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety . \\nuhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say . \\nberesford wisely exercises restraint in the film\\'s dramatic moments . \\nthe movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular . \\nthe only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees . \\n',\n"," b'i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files . \\nfirst , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . \\nthe producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable . \\nyou have to reach for a larger audience . \\ntherefore , the movie is quite user-friendly . \\naltough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . \\nbut fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . \\nyou will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . \\nin any case , the answer is no . \\ni am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . \\nhowever , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie\\'s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . \\ni taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . \\neverything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . \\ni know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . \\nwarning : major spoilers follow ! \\nplease do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . \\nyou have been warned . \\nthe x-files is what a summer should be . \\nexciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . \\nthis is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . \\nfrom start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . \\nwhen i compare it with last summer\\'s movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . \\nthis flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . \\nin fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . \\nyou might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! \\nthe last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . \\nyou know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? \\nso yeah , the x-files is scary . \\nand guess what ? \\nyou never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . \\ndo not think that the x-files is a monster movie . \\nin fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . \\nno , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series . \\nscully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . \\nshe has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . \\nno , this is mulder\\'s time in the spotlight . \\nby now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . \\nif you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let\\'s just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . \\nto those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who \\ncares ! ? \\nif he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? \\nthe dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . \\nthe camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . \\nthe script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . \\nif you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! \\nunlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . \\nmiss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . \\nalso , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don\\'t ! \\nthe person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . \\nthere is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? \\n ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . \\nwho needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? \\nso far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i\\'d recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . \\nbut the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is . \\nwhat more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? \\ncool effects ? \\nit\\'s got some . \\npulse pounding ? \\nhell yes ! \\nstrangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time . \\nit does not provide answers to the show\\'s many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . \\nrating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" \\nmoments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . \\nyou may wonder where this movie lost half a star . \\nwell , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . \\nit\\'s pretty obvious the film\\'s makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving . \\n',\n"," b'the most amazing thing about paul cox\\'s innocence is how unlike a movie it is . \\ni mean that as the highest compliment . \\nif most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i\\'d want to run and hide . \\nthe sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters\\' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence . \\nalong with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable . \\nthe romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles \" bud \" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby . \\nthey decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair . \\ncomplicating matters is andreas\\' frail health , and claire\\'s longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can\\'t understand why he\\'s suddenly become obsolete . \\nin my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved . \\njohn , claire\\'s husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong . \\nclaire initially insists she\\'s a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her . \\nandreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence . \\ncox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train . \\nit\\'s a reminder of andreas and claire\\'s past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed . \\na pall is cast on the whole affair . \\na master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments . \\nin andreas\\' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire\\'s love . \\nwe also get glimpses into john and claire\\'s relationship . \\nduring a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could . \\nall that\\'s heard is the scraping of forks against plates . \\nthe characters are unlike anything i\\'ve seen -- they\\'re people . \\nso many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky . \\nor they\\'re reduced to comedic buffoons . \\nordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren\\'t sure what the next step is . \\nthey do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they\\'ve known throughout their adult lives . \\nbravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire\\'s affair is automatically justified . \\nnorris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire\\'s love difficult to accept . \\nwe feel for him . \\nhe\\'s a decent man . \\nsure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now . \\nwith so much presented to the audience , it\\'s only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does . \\nhowever , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn\\'t likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon . \\n',\n"," b' \" through a spyglass , i could see everything . \" \\nking louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer\\'s the lady and the duke observes from afar . \\nconsider it a view to a kill made abstract . \\na proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants . \\nthe maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , \" i don\\'t know , \" ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air . \\nwhat we don\\'t see might not be able to hurt us . \\njust close your eyes and think of england . \\nduring times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . \\nadapted from elliott\\'s memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer\\'s latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . \\nresisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . \\ngrace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . \\na foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace\\'s life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king\\'s hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) . \\nthe times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . \\nduring the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke\\'s sister-in-law on a stake . \\nrohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . \\nin doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . \\nwhen grace sees her friend\\'s disembodied head on a pole , rohmer\\'s attention drifts from the societal change to one woman\\'s reaction shot , laden with hot tears . \\ngrace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . \\nthrough her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist\\'s escape . \\ngrace doesn\\'t even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . \\nshe endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . \\nmaintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . \\nthe events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . \\naristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . \\nthe duke is called to vote on the king\\'s punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . \\nthe episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . \\nlazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . \\nthat\\'s foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer\\'s characters occasionally become didactic . \\nrohmer\\'s imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . \\nwhat may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer\\'s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . \\nthe actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . \\nthis recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets . \\nit looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron\\'s debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone . \\nwhy ? \\nthey aren\\'t real . \\nthe very foundation rohmer\\'s characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory . \\nscreened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) . \\n',\n"," b'after the average mouse hunt , the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz , dreamworks try again with the children\\'s film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story . \\nas the film warns us at the beginning , it\\'s not the full story , and some liberties have been taken , but generally this the bible story we all know and love , featuring burning bushes , the plagues and the parting of the red sea . \\nthe only thing missing is charlton heston . \\ninstead , we get val kilmer voicing moses , an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt ( helen mirren . ) \\nwe flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses ( fiennes ) all grown up . \\nmoses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron ( sandra bullock and jeff goldblum ) that he isn\\'t really the son of the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule . \\nhe soon sets about this , along with his wife tzipporah ( michelle pfeiffer . ) \\nrameses and his two wizard friends ( voiced by steve martin and martin short ) try to stop moses completing his task . \\nwhile the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults , for children reared on aladdin and hercules , this film could be the most godawful thing they\\'ve ever seen . \\ngone is the quick fire humour and standard , easy to follow plot . \\nbut , spectacularly , and to dreamworks credit , nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen . \\njeffrey katzenberg , who produced this film , certainly knows how to keep a child interested . \\nhe\\'s included some songs in the film , plus some comedy , and a exciting chariot chase , to keep the children interested . \\nand somehow , himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across , without ever being boring . \\nit\\'s a remarkable achievement . \\nalso remarkable is the animation , which puts hercules , an almost \\'slap dash\\' effort , to shame . \\nrelying on hand drawn and computer animation , the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed . \\nthe film seems a little caught up with it\\'s amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and \\'moving\\' shots , but they _do_ look incredible . \\nthe final \\'plague\\' where god kills every first born child , and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed . \\nkudos to the animators . \\nthe vocal talent is also very good . \\nval kilmer does a fine job as moses ( although he doesn\\'t sing ) and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses ( and he _does_ sing . ) \\nsandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great , and steve martin and martin short are very good , but not in the film long enough . \\nfinally , michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife . \\nkudos also goes to the voice of god , who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued . \\nsadly , he is uncredited , and i couldn\\'t quite work out who the voice was . \\n ( but e-mail if you do . ) \\nthe songs are good , ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number . \\nthey don\\'t disturb the movie , and while not particularly memorable , they are nice to listen to ( they\\'re well sung aswell . ) \\nthe musical score is suitably epic , with some beautiful tunes . \\ncoupled with the superb visuals , the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat , backed up with a great story . \\nentertaining both for kids and adults , this film is a must see . \\na david wilcock review ? 1998 \\n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \\n',\n"," b'there have been merchant-ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than \" the mod squad , \" a self-consciously \" hip \" cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby-boomers . \\nwell , said \" squad \" certainly won\\'t be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else , maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards . \\na contemporary take on this decidedly \\'70s show doesn\\'t exactly seem unwarranted , but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didn\\'t transform into a full-blown case of botulism . \\nhow curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad , insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time . \\nthey are julie , pete and linc , reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd ( exposition put out of the way so fast that you\\'re likely to be lost from the opening moments on ) , and they are respectively played by claire danes , giovanni ribisi and omar epps , talented actors each deserving of better than this . \\ntheir plight involves standard cop-corruption stuff , as our would-be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover-up after their superior ( reliable dennis farina , one of the best things here and gone so quickly ) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking . \\nthey pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others . \\nwhen you\\'re supposed to be asking , \" what\\'s going to happen next ? \" , \\nyou\\'ll instead entertain thoughts like \" who are these people and why should i care ? \" \\nor \" aren\\'t thrillers supposed to contain thrills ? \" \\nnot that danes , epps and ribisi don\\'t give it a shot . \\ndanes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep , as evidenced by \" my so-called life , \" but she\\'s saddled with a mysterious-boyfriend ( josh brolin ) subplot so see-through you begin to seriously question her so-called intelligence . \\nditto for ribisi\\'s ( \" saving private ryan \" ) looney loose cannon , though at least he performs with a wild-and-crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention . \\nbut epps - poor epps . \\nepps ( \" higher learning \" ) is so short-changed he\\'s reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him . \\nall this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters , one of whom , scott silver , is also the director . \\nthey must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings ( the look of the film is really quite impressive ) , it\\'ll somehow pay off , but this \" mod squad \" plods anyway . \\ncharacters are non-existent ; present are just some good-looking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes . \\nplot hardly escapes confusing convention . \\nand the one genre element you\\'d think would be show up in generous portions - a few nifty explosions , some fights , any kind of action whatsoever - only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest . \\nall those quick to put down last month\\'s inept but serviceable \" my favorite martian \" update need to take a step back . \\nhere\\'s a small-to-big-screen translation that really should\\'ve stayed in its former incarnation , \" mod \" or not . \\n',\n"," b'the rich legacy of

a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug . \\n \" starship troopers , \" loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects . \\nin the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale . \\nto put it simply , it\\'s a bug bomb . \\nin \" robocop \" and \" total recall , \" verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and \" starship troopers \" starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise . \\nthings go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school . \\ninexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial . \\nit\\'s a veritable \" alpha centuri 90210 \" as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love . \\nmichael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities . \\neventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds . \\none of their classmates , carl jenkins ( \" doogie houser\\'s \" neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities . \\nhe displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother\\'s leg . \\na long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the \" showgirls \" director\\'s camera roams over their buff bodies . \\nfinally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy . \\nthe bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space . \\nthey attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears . \\nyes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts . \\na phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best . \\nsweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter . \\nthe insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating . \\nthe attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension . \\nwhile the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly . \\nverhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children \" doing their part for the war effort \" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren\\'t enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck . \\none can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here . \\nhis customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders . \\nin \" showgirls \" fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good . \\nan intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing \" dixie \" on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal . \\na sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn\\'t mind dying . \\n \" it\\'s okay , \" she gasps , \" i got to have you ! \" \\nand then , of course , there\\'s doogie\\'s mind meld with a bug . \\nit\\'s possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel . \\nheinlein\\'s pre- \" stranger in a strange land \" books were aimed at adolescent males , and \" starship troopers \" has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi . \\nthe one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting . \\nthe hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion . \\nultimately , verhoeven\\'s motives are irrelevant . \\nhe has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire . \\nit even fails to be an entertaining bad movie . \\navoid \" starship troopers \" at all costs . \\n',\n"," b'any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it . \\nunfortunately , this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible , directed by brian depalma . \\nthe first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever , aside from the music . \\nthe tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork , orchestrated by jim phelps , allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world . \\nteamwork was the key . \\nthis film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalma\\'s \" blow out , \" where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions . \\nit was travolta\\'s vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic . \\nin this film , tom cruise is basically omniscient ( believe that ? ) and so there\\'s no fun going on here whatsoever . \\nthe story is about as contrived as contrived gets , and is full of holes . \\nthere are basically two memorable sequences : one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room -- a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense ( suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room ) ; the second involves a high-speed train , a helicopter , and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved . \\nthe actors are all miscast , especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife , who cannot act , and ving rhames as a computer hacker ( ! ) , who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie . \\ntom cruise is no james bond , and jon voight looks more like bobby \" the brain \" heenan than jim phelps . \\nbrian depalma\\'s career has been bafflingly erratic . \\nat his best , he beats hitchcock at his own game ( \" blow out , \" \" carrie , \" \" body double \" ) but this is not his best . \\nthe screenplay was partly written by robert towne , who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in \" chinatown , \" but this script is perfunctory at best , and terrrible at worst . \\nthe cinematography has a comic book red/blue emphasis , which is nice to look at , but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed and this movie even features the old \" killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape \" trick . \\nplease don\\'t spend your money on this ; it\\'ll only encourage hollywood to make more . \\n',\n"," b'here\\'s something to chew on : what\\'s the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ? \\nthe obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that\\'s the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature . \\ndeep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer . \\nin fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was . \\nthe most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore . \\nnot since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions . \\nwe learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers . \\ni suppose deep rising\\'s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn\\'t do much for me . \\non the surface , and that\\'s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) . \\nin going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin . \\nthe film is not humorous , tense , or exciting . \\nin fact , it\\'s downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron\\'s current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie . \\nis it really necessary to say anything about the plot ? \\nprobably not , since it\\'s easy to guess , but i\\'ll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis . \\nthe film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship . \\nin addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there\\'s finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat\\'s pilot , who\\'s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o\\'connor ) , the inept sidekick who\\'s supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the \" mastermind \" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation . \\ntheir goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes . \\nthe problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste . \\naside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there\\'s no one on board . \\nthe reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles . \\nthe cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad\\'s cinque ) . \\nwilliams , once a \" can\\'t miss \" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career . \\nfamke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams . \\ngiven her limited acting abilities , it\\'s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes . \\nunfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture . \\nmeanwhile , kevin j . o\\'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard . \\nthese days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects . \\nthis is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn . \\nthe days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past . \\nnow , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it\\'s impossible to tell where they end and where \" reality \" begins . \\nin deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing . \\nunfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn\\'t so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) . \\neven once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won\\'t be the last of its kind . \\nlike the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush . \\nand that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying . \\n',\n"," b'the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few minutes into \"

next few minutes , as the barely double entendres and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous , i realized that the mindset behind \" heartbreakers \" predated \" three\\'s company . \" \\nsuddenly , i had an out-of-body experience as my internal way-back machine swept me to the mid-1960s . \\nall across america , the counter-culture was growing like wildfire , but there was scant evidence of it on tv . \\nwhile young people were challenging traditional values on the streets , frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home , sulking while our parents enjoyed the latest bob

and broads \" and peter lawford , decked out in love beads and a nehru jacket , purred suggestive one-liners as he ogled the go-go dancers . \\nthe adults laughed and laughed . \\n \" heartbreakers \" reeks of that stagnant mentality , from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt\\'s vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden screenplay , which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated . \\nin addition to liotta and hewitt , the cast includes sigourney weaver , gene hackman , jason lee , nora dunn and anne bancroft . \\ni can\\'t imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project . \\nperhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the \\'60s . \\nif so , they were sadly mistaken . \\nthe story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team . \\nit opens with the marriage of max ( weaver ) to dean ( liotta ) , a new jersey chop shop operator . \\nhaving withheld sex until the honeymoon , max pretends to pass out on their wedding night . \\nthe next morning , she feigns illness , sending a very horny dean off to the office , where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary . \\njust as the two are about to get overtly physical , max bursts into the room and catches them . \\nthe \" horrified \" bride dissolves the union , garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way . \\nof course , the secretary was really her daughter page ( hewitt ) and the whole thing was a set-up . \\nthe women move on , but an irs agent ( bancroft ) catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes . \\nin desperate need of funds , max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam . \\ntheir mark this time is william b . tensy ( hackman , in hideous make-up ) , a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking . \\nmax starts to put the game into action , but page is so repelled by the old man ( and angry with her mom ) that she slips off to enact her own score , targeting jack , a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune . \\ncomplications arise when page realizes that good-natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart . \\nas if that wasn\\'t enough , dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind . \\nthe attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior \" a fish called wanda . \" \\ni won\\'t bother to compare the two . \\nsuffice to say that everything done right in \" wanda \" is done wrong here . \\n \" heartbreakers \" is soulless , inept and , at 123 minutes , at least a half-hour too long . \\nsigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts , but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters . \\ngene hackman is utterly wasted in a one-note , one-joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking , coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex . \\npoor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland . \\nray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich ? , but only a bit . \\nthe low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince , while doing half-assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue . \\nbear in mind , though , that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low points . \\nif you remember bob hope specials with fondness , this might be your cup of tea . \\nas for me , i\\'m

films \" which are finding their way into theaters . \\nthe situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can\\'t , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh . \\nteenagers and jim carrey fans probably won\\'t find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will . \\nput simply , brooks\\' comedy is intelligent . \\nmother is albert brooks\\' latest film , and it does not disappoint . \\nbrooks plays john henderson , a middle-aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce . \\nhe makes an attempt at dating , but fails miserably . \\nhe then has dinner with his brother jeff ( rob morrow ) , a successful sports agent who seems to live the ideal life . \\njeff has a good job , a loving family , and most of all , a warm relationship with their mother beatrice ( debbie reynolds ) . \\nafter dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is . \\nin comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her . \\nat the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john\\'s life , she says , \" i love you , \" and john replies with , \" i know you think you do . \" \\nthe thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading . \\nit\\'s the kind that goes something like , \" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . \" \\nit seems as though nothing he does makes her happy . \\nthere\\'s always the big but . \\njohn believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner . \\nhe comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is . \\n \" a great experiment \" , he calls it . \\nbrooks\\' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother . \\nthere\\'s a scene where john has just arrived at his mother\\'s house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the \" great experiment \" , beatrice asks , \" now explain to me again why you don\\'t want to stay at a hotel . \" \\nshe still doesn\\'t get it , and it is absolutely hilarious . \\nin the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh . \\nshe apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over . \\nwhen john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze . \\n \" you\\'ve named the ice ? \" \\nasks john . \\nhe\\'s also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese . \\n \" the freezer was a good invention , \" says john , \" but it\\'s not supposed to be used for everything . \\nthat\\'s why it\\'s smaller than the refrigerator . \" \\nit\\'s something most of us find strangely familiar . \\nbrooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur . \\nfor example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep\\'s characters are in a comedy club having a discussion . \\nwhen they\\'re finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , \" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! \" \\nyou don\\'t know what the joke was because you couldn\\'t hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context . \\nin this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene . \\ni don\\'t want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past . \\njohn\\'s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him . \\nhis mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth . \\nwatching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way . \\non screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world . \\nin a way , he\\'s very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude . \\ncasting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect . \\nshe assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it\\'s hard to get mad at her character . \\nthis only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her . \\nas his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer\\'s disease . \\nthat may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely . \\nrob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother\\'s favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama\\'s boy . \\nthe only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes . \\na solid connection is not really made between john\\'s troubles and his reasons for living with his mother . \\nadditionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? : \\nbeatrice : you must think i\\'m some kind of moron . \\njohn : no , i think your someone who thinks i\\'m a moron . \\nbeatrice : well , it takes one to know one . \\n',\n"," b'i\\'ve heard it called \" jaws with claws \" and that\\'s a fair summation of the plot , though that tag line does little to quantify quality . \\ndirector stephen hopkins ( blown away , predator 2 ) and screenwriter william goldman ( maverick , misery ) would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature , based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century . \\nthey\\'ve stacked the deck with two big stars ( val kilmer , michael douglas ) , a bigger production design , beautiful photography ( by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond ) , and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t make a lick of sense , though , either as an epic or as your basic boo-fest . \\nin fact , some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you\\'ve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 : the movie . \\nhow about the three guys with rifles , who trap a lion and then can\\'t even hit the damned thing ? \\nor the ham-on-wry acting of michael douglas , who chews more scenery than the animals ever do ? ? \\nor , my favorite , lions so agile that they can even climb onto rooftops ? ! ? \\n',\n"," b'it should have been a classic . \\na great cast of respected supporting actors . \\nan interesting premise of loser comic book characters . \\nhowever , \" mystery men \" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 . \\nthe jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals . \\nthe number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise . \\nthe script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all . \\nthe jokes were not funny for a number of reasons . \\nthey had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film . \\n \" mystery men \" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business . \\nbut with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought . \\nthankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie . \\nthe film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy . \\nthe fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city . \\ncaptain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity . \\nafter freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured . \\nit is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day . \\nby the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven\\'t already figured it out ) is very low . \\nthere are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention . \\nthe first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down . \\nright when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk\\'s home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie . \\ninstead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was . \\na simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work . \\nanother major problem with \" mystery men \" is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances . \\nthe film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion . \\nhowever , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way . \\nto pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone\\'s joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about . \\nas a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes . \\nfart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of \" american pie \" and \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n \" mystery men \" drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining . \\nanyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way . \\nso why continue to watch ? \\nthis film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure . \\n \" mystery men \" indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says \" i knew you could do it ! \" \\n \" mystery men \" fails in every category it attempts to pass . \\nwhat makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable . \\nterrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors . \\n \" i\\'m unpredictable ! \" \\nan overexcited ben stiller shouts out . \\nno ben , you\\'re the complete opposite . \\n',\n"," b'so , it\\'s thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again . \\nthat might have been an exciting notion if it wasn\\'t for the fact that the \" odd couple \" of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993\\'s \" grumpy old men , \" 1995\\'s \" grumpier old men , \" and 1997\\'s \" out to sea \" ( i . e . \\n \" grumpiest old men \" ) . \\nso , \" the odd couple ii \" ( i . e . \\n \" the grumpiest old men of all , really \" ) seems just another entry in a tired series . \\nthe plot is even similar to that of \" grumpy old men \" in that lemmon and matthau\\'s mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children . \\noscar\\'s son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix\\'s daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car . \\n . \\n . \\nthen hilarity ensues . \\nwell , a few chuckles ensue anyway . \\nneil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end . \\nunlike the original play/movie , \" odd couple ii \" doesn\\'t find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters . \\ninstead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of \" cybill \" and jean smart of \" designing women \" ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert . \\nthe original 1968 movie \" the odd couple \" remains a classic comedy . \\nit introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since . \\nit was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966\\'s \" the fortune cookie \" ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , \" the front page \" ( 1974 ) and \" buddy buddy \" ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways . \\nthe reunion of lemmon and matthau in \" grumpy old men \" six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie . \\nbut \" out to sea \" and \" the odd couple ii \" are just beating a grumpy old horse . \\n ( you can add lemmon\\'s \" my fellow americans , \" i . e . \\n \" grumpy old presidents , \" to that list , too . ) \\nlet\\'s hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do . \\nlet\\'s hope also that we see neil simon\\'s name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993\\'s \" lost in yonkers \" ) . \\n',\n"," b'the cartoon is way better . \\nthat\\'s the bottom line on disney\\'s incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature . \\nthe alliance between disney and slapstick king john hughes has produced a frenetic \" home alone \" with puppies , and not much else . \\nwhen production of this remake was announced , the big question seemed to be \" why ? \\nthe original cartoon still works , so what\\'s the point ? \" \\nthe answer , it appears , is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign . \\nthe story , for those of you who missed childhood , is simple . \\ntwo dalmatians , pongo and perdy , fall in love at first sight . \\nthey drag their \" human pets \" together , and in a short time both couples marry . \\nthe heavenly match-ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy\\'s new-born pups are stolen ; their dog-napping engineered by the evil cruella devil , who wants them for their pelts . \\neveryone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies . \\nin the original movie , the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities . \\nwe also could hear them talk , which quickly established a crucial element to the charm of the film , the dog\\'s view of humans as their pets . \\nin the new version , the dogs are mute and expressionless . \\nhughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other and licking their faces and necks . \\nwhile he drew the desired \" aww , they\\'re so cute \" reaction from the audience , it was quickly followed by several people whispering \" i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog\\'s heads to get them licking like that ? \" \\nthe canines\\' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little . \\njoely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles . \\nin previous films , daniels successfully played off his white bread persona . \\nin \" something wild \" , he revealed the rebellious thrill-seeker beneath his neutral demeanor . \\nin \" terms of endearment \" , his hapless appearance masked a cold , manipulative womanizer . \\nhere , he and richardson are so consistently bland that it\\'s a wonder their images even stick to the film . \\nglenn close , however , has no problems establishing a distinct personality . \\nas the villainous icon cruella devil , she tears up the screen in a deliciously over-the-top performance . \\nclose matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself . \\nwith a two-tone fright wig , red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips , garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels , close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature . \\nshe\\'s clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon , and her wicked glee is infectious . \\nwhen she spits out lines like \" you\\'ve won the battle , but i\\'m about to win the wardrobe ! , \" \\nthe film comes briefly to life . \\n \" 101 dalmatians \" is crammed with john hughes\\' typical heavy-handed approach to comedy . \\nafter an ingenuous opening showing pongo\\'s morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day , the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park . a little slapstick goes a long way , but hughes just keeps laying it on . \\nthe second half of the film , where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen , is a tedious home alone clone , with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy & scratchy cartoon , including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence . \\n \" 101 dalmatians \" has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close , but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick , bland characters , and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high-fiving one another . \\nrent the cartoon ! \\n',\n"," b'plot : a rich guy who doesn\\'t believe in

like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman ! \\ni mean , it\\'s like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the

hazmat elimination , run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant , david caruso , assures a town engineer ( paul guilifoyle ) that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week . \\nerected in 1871 , deserted and decomposing since 1985 , the danvers mental hospital , is one of the most malevolent \" locations \" ever chosen for a film . \\nthe structure is so massive - with its labyrinth of rubble-strewn corridors , collapsing floors , stagnant pools of water , isolation cells , and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre-frontal lobotomies were performed - that their task seems impossible within that time frame . \\nand each member of their inexperienced crew ( stephan gevedon , brandon sexton iii , and josh lucas ) is coping with his own personal demons as , one by one , their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which they\\'re working . \\nthe film\\'s title is derived from salvaged reel-to-reel audio-recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities . \\nby the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters . \\nfilmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw-massacre-type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn\\'t particularly scary . \\nthe conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing . \\non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" session 9 \" is a dark , gloomy 4 . silly me . . . at \\nfirst , i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs . danvers , the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcock\\'s truly terrifying \" rebecca \" that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley . \\n',\n"," b\"and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics , and it isn't pretty . \\nthis time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers . \\nby bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . \\nthe end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . \\nthe story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . \\nd'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . \\nhe travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . \\nin paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . \\nhe finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison . \\nd'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . \\ndirector peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it's a disaster . \\none problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . \\njet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around . \\nironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . \\nmost asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . \\nthe musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . \\nchambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- he's a mouseketeer ! \\nand hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted , but that's the only standout in an overall flat production . \\n\",\n"," b'an 18-foot-high , 43-foot-long dragon is the computer-generated co- star of this strictly-by-the-numbers

with welle\\'s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft . \\nwhile several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle\\'s attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set . \\nimpressive

version of the somerset maugham short story \" miss thompson \" . \\nthis is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script . \\nthe actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie\\'s soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel . \\nswanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie . \\nunfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script . \\nthe happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i cannot believe maugham\\'s short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we\\'ve been waiting an hour and a half for . \\nstill , it\\'s entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore\\'s incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone

leaves him a good deal of money . \\nhis uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . \\nmeier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his

with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew\\'s work--while everyone think\\'s he\\'s still living in east germany . \\nof course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . \\nthe humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as

helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements \\nafter a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i\\'ve learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : \\n1 ) be wary of french comedies . \\nthese people like jerry lewis . \\n2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . \\n3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as \" old pouty-lips \" is probably not worth watching . \\n4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! \\naustralia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task . \\nwell , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . \\nit\\'s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30\\'s about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . \\nlots and lots of horses . \\nthe film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . \\nunfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . \\nhighlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor\\'s daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it\\'s raining--you\\'d think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . \\nthe photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway . \\nactually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that\\'s life . \\ngrade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you\\'re looking for inadvertent yuks . \\n',\n"," b'if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it\\'s their predictable endings . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does . \\nunfortunately for the devil\\'s advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film . \\nnevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . \\ni don\\'t think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan . \\nwell , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . \\nkevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . \\nhe ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . \\nhe leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . \\nhe accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . \\nafter proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . \\nhe graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . \\nhe is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . \\nhis life seems to be on the rise . \\nand of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . \\nhe is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . \\nmary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted . \\nmeanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . \\nhe spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane . \\nall of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself . \\nafter a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin\\'s wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . \\na fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin\\'s real father . \\nis it all just a big nightmare ? \\nor is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin\\'s life ? \\nthe devil\\'s advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don\\'t expect . \\nis this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ? \\nif so , the devil\\'s advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . \\ni went into the devil\\'s advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . \\ni was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . \\nbut what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn\\'t like the ending ? ) . \\nthe producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . \\nfilms like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . \\nwe know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all . \\nif that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . \\nas for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . \\nthe film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . \\nand then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . \\nit was at this point that i felt cheated . \\ntaking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . \\neverything occurs from his perspective . \\nhe is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . \\nbut we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . \\ni don\\'t want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . \\nperhaps the most shocking thing about the devil\\'s advocate is the extreme amount of everything . \\nit earned its r rating for a reason . \\nthere is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . \\nthis film really isn\\'t subtle about anything , showing us everything . \\nit actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . \\nhowever , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . \\ni don\\'t condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . \\nthe biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . \\nthe confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . \\nportrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann\\'s problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . \\nthis may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . \\nshe is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . \\nsomething the devil\\'s advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . \\nthe story actually has something to say about humanity . \\nin one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . \\nhe comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . \\nthen , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . \\nthis semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . \\nwhat milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . \\nthese moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil\\'s advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i\\'m sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . \\nwhen a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . \\nthe cast of the devil\\'s advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don\\'t expect . \\nheather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . \\nprobably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . \\nhe has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . \\ni have never seen him more believable to date . \\nal pacino is of course the scene stealer . \\nhis devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . \\nhe could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . \\njeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller\\'s day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . \\njudith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin\\'s past . \\nconnie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . \\none familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance . \\nthe devil\\'s advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . \\nat 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . \\nfor the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . \\nthe technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . \\ndirector taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . \\ni guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . \\nbut just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . \\npersonally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early . \\n',\n"," b'i want to be involved in show business one day . \\nand i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse . \\nthis movie proves it for me . \\ni was a little worried about the last batman film , as i thought joel schumaccer , taking over from tim burton , would screw it up . \\ni also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne . \\nthey didn\\'t . \\nkilmer did a good job , and the cast was left to carry the movie , which they did ( even jim carrey as the riddler and i can\\'t stand jim carrey ) , because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles . \\nthis film is different . \\nthe cast is still impressive , but here , not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction ( he\\'s one of those directors who\\'s good with actors , terrible with camera angles ) , but writer akiva goldsmith doesn\\'t really give an impressive cast anything to do . \\nthe cast is impressive : clooney is a surprisingly good wayne/batman , o\\'donnell is a crafty robin as usual , they could\\'ve casted somebody better as batgirl ( my friend likes neve campbell ) , but silverstone is not bad , and thurman is a good poison ivy . \\nthe major problem is schwarzenegger , who is a terrible freeze . \\nhis accent is so heavy , you can\\'t understand what he says , and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act , and they know it , but they figure that if they flex their muscles , say a limited amount of stuff , and kill a bunch of guys , then they figure nobody\\'ll notice . \\nthat\\'s the trouble with me , * i * notice . \\nschwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney , or as much money as he got for this , but hollywood thinks he does . \\npatrick stewart was the person i\\'d heard that was considered to play freeze , and he would\\'ve been so much better . \\nor sean connery , but not arnold \" i\\'m not an actor , but i play one in real life \" schwarzenegger . \\ni realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film , but it would\\'ve been nice if they\\'d casted a star that had talent for the role . \\nakiva goldsmith\\'s screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film . \\nin a regular batman film , they\\'d concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more , but elle macpherson\\'s julie madison is so limited here that we never get a real sense of who she is . \\nthere is talk of a fifth batman movie . \\nmy interest to see it is low , but i hope it\\'s better than this . \\nif you don\\'t want to waste your time , rent any of the other batman movies from blockbuster . \\nany other . \\n',\n"," b\"there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it . \\nthen there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions and try to answer it all in the last five minutes . \\nwriter-director john herzfeld's two days in the valley falls into the latter category . \\nweaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters , herzfeld's tries very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories . \\nhitmen lee ( james spader ) and his partner dosmo ( danny aiello ) pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox ( teri hatcher ) lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind she got nicely pricked . \\nan understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops , ( jeff daniels ) and wes ( eric stoltz ) . \\na murder is not vice territory , flirting with asian prostitues is , but wes would rather play inquisitive detective . \\nmeanwhile , washed-up director , teddy ( paul mazursky ) is about to end his life . \\nbut before he can do that , he must find a good home for his dog . \\nenter nurse audrey ( marsha mason ) , who takes the dog and teddy for a ride . \\nstuffy art dealer , allan hopper ( greg cruttwell ) has kidney stones . \\nwhile struggling about his fancy house , he switches between moaning in self-pity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretary's ( glenne headly ) plain appearance . \\ndon't be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on . \\nyou might like that feeling of cluelessness . \\nherzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes . \\nthe jigsaw puzzle assembled isn't stunning by any means though . \\nthe characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman's real-life heroes in short cuts , even though they are interesting and funny . \\nfunny , that is if you aren't comparing them to the likes of tarantino's pulp chcaracters . \\nthe tie-up is tidy but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of ( director's name ? \\nguy who also did last seduction ) red rock west . \\ntwo days isn't a bad movie but there isn't much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters . \\nit'll keep you guessing alright but you won't remember the answers five minutes after the credits . \\nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying

ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last . \\ni thought stripes would be different . \\nwith ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and

armageddon ) bring us a slick and entertaining remake of the 1974 film of the same name that absolutely no one has ever seen . \\nnicolas cage plays memphis , a retired car thief who\\'s \" pulled back in \" to the business by an evil car thief overlord ( christopher eccleston ) determined to kill memphis\\' kid brother ( giovanni ribisi ) . \\nmemphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four days time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise , all while having to elude the detectives hot on his trail and a rival car thief who feels the job should have been given to him and his gang . \\nmemphis sets out to put his old crew back together , but discovers that most of them have retired as well . \\ngone in sixty seconds does things right from the opening credits . \\nin that sequence , we get a rockin\\' little tune from moby , along with some simple back story told only with photographs and assorted objects . \\nfilmmakers can sometimes make or break a film just from its opening title sequence , and this one easily gets you in the mindset for an entertaining ride . \\nand what follows doesn\\'t disappoint . . . \\ncage turns in one of his good performances here ( he can easily go either way . . . \\ngood or bad . . . \\ni don\\'t know how he does that ) , and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely . \\nof the supporting cast members , angelina jolie as memphis\\' former love is in the film just to provide eye candy ( she\\'s definitely the hottest looking grease monkey i\\'ve ever seen ) and robert duvall as memphis\\' former mentor is just around to lend the film some class . \\nalso , i\\'m a big fan of will patton ( armageddon , the postman ) and would love to see him get a huge role someday . \\nnone of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately . \\nsome underrated performers however are given meaty supporting roles . \\ndelroy lindo ( get shorty ) shines as the exasperated detective in pursuit of memphis , as does timothy olyphant ( go ) as lindo\\'s partner . \\ni just wish some of the other characters could have been as important . \\nthe only real gripe i have about the film though is its conclusion . . . \\nmainly because you know how it will end before the opening credits even roll . \\nthere\\'s no doubt in anyone\\'s mind that the 50 cars will be successfully stolen , and the filmmakers blew a perfectly good opportunity to add some suspense to the picture by using the \" rival car thief \" plot line . \\nas it stands , that story line is wrapped up about halfway through the film in a tidy little package . \\nbut if i was making this film , i\\'d have had the rival gang trying to get to the cars before memphis and his crew , thereby making memphis have to improvise . . . \\nthereby adding some meat to the plot . \\nthe finale is essentially just a big car chase , and there just aren\\'t ways to make car chases interesting anymore . \\nit\\'s all been done . \\nthe chase is also shot and edited in that \" jerry bruckheimer action sequence \" kind of way that leaves the audience wondering what specifically is going on in the scene . \\nsure it\\'s a car chase , but what exactly are the particulars of it ? \\nit\\'s very hard to tell . \\nfinally , there\\'s a stunt during this scene that comes close to challenging the \" bus jumping the ramp \" sequence from

represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade . \\ntragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity . \\nmost of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus . \\nthose two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends . \\nunfortunately , that didn't happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal . \\nsadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process . \\non the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself . \\none of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 . \\nin the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence . \\nthat movie was far from masterpiece ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) . \\nunfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality . \\ndeath wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out . \\nbefore the reunion , kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o'herlihy , probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) . \\nkersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade , while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime . \\nbronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine . \\nalthough bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film . \\nthe movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade . \\non the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey . \\nunfortunately , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang . \\nthe big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget . \\nin short , this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia . \\n ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis , the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) . \\n\",\n"," b\"i don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting , when in fact it's ludicrous . \\nin the case of the general's daughter , the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point . \\nbut at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie . \\nthis predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws . \\nget past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent , and you're likely to survive this entire movie . \\ntravolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner , who's working undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer ( leslie stefanson ) . \\nit turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) . \\nlet the investigation begin . \\nwith the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill ( played rather on-the-sidelines by madeleine stowe ) , brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case . \\nthings begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore ( james woods ) , a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve . \\nwoods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar . \\nwith echoes of his supporting role in true crime , in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable . \\nhere though , the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta , as the two send mindful , knowing glares across the room . \\nthere are many scenes such as this in the general's daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb . \\ndirector simon west ( con air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it . \\nthe general's daughter is , more often than not , a predictable and unexciting mess . \\nit does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless , dragging it's heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace . \\na few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package . \\nfrom a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts , i suggest west should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this . \\nstill , the movie is certainly not without it's merits . \\nthe acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast . \\nthe performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell , who doesn't show off his real talents here ) . \\nmadeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while , but as the female lead in an action-thriller , she doesn't pull through sufficiently . \\none of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable . \\n>from minute one , i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question . \\nthe script even unwillingly points him out for us , using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end . \\nin all fairness , we've seen many of the devices used in the general's daughter put to greater effect in other films . \\nthe secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually , but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly . \\nthe general's daughter is not a terrible movie , and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer's attention span for a certain period of time . \\nbut it just could have been so much better . \\n\",\n"," b\"i've got to admit it . . . \\ni'm a huge jim carrey fan . \\ni loved the first ace ventura , as well as the mask and dumb and dumber--and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie ) , carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good . \\nuntil i saw ace ventura 2 , i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying . \\nsadly , ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be . \\ncarrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie , but this time it is no longer funny--it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i . \\nthe plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof ) . \\nsoon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and , if not returned in four days , will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other . \\nonce again , it's up to ace to save the day , using his uncanny detective skills . \\nthose who have been disappointed by carrey's more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over-acting to the best of his ability , but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn't capture the feel of the original . \\nthe original benefited from what looked to be carrey's constant hyped-up improv sequences , which were hysterically funny . \\nhere , however , the tighter script ( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies ) takes the improvised material from the first , and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie , giving carrey little chance to improvise . \\ninstead , his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly . \\nbut one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself . \\nin the first movie , he was always cool , and one step ahead of every one else--perfect for carrey's off-the-wall approach . \\nbut here , ventura is made to look a lot stupider , and is often made out as the straight guy--a role which is definitely not carrey's style . \\nthere are definitely some very funny moments , but they are few and far between . \\nthey are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura , or even dumb and dumber . \\n\",\n"," b'historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s . \\nfor many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects . \\nbut in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre . \\nand , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with \" oscars \" . \\nthe name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson . \\nthe plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) . \\nin his time , english king edward i \" longshanks \" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by \" ius primae noctis \" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights . \\nalthough english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn\\'t care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) . \\nmurron\\'s death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country . \\nthrough time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace\\'s rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge . \\nbut the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn\\'t like to have a simple commoner as a national leader . \\nbraveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn\\'t be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann . \\nhowever , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre . \\nthe most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism . \\nwhile older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish . \\nthis general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven\\'s ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood . \\ncompared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays . \\nbraveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics . \\nwhat makes braveheart \" larger than life \" is his protagonist . \\nmel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero . \\nwallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side . \\nnaturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) . \\nhowever , even those who don\\'t particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child . \\nbecause of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren\\'t as effective as they should be . \\nmel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors . \\nmost memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema . \\nbrendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman\\'s general ) is also very good as wallace\\'s trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol . \\ndavid o\\'harra is very entertaining as wallace\\'s irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce . \\nwomen in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess . \\ncatherine mccormack as wallace\\'s wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on . \\nfrom the technical point of view , the film is also very good . \\nphotography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen . \\non the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times . \\nalthough mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism . \\nthe main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of \" longshank \" \\'s son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) . \\nhe is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain\\'s camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in \" politically correct \" hollywood . \\nto make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives\\' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals . \\nhowever , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century . \\naccording to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges . \\nthis marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety . \\nin the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre . \\n',\n"," b\"when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain , you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie . \\nhowever , since this film also featured michael madsen , more than capable character actor , this time in the role of protagonist , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt . \\nhowever , the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio ( played by lynch ) . \\nhowever , the raid was only partially successful , and montana is getting the rap . \\nso , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt . \\nin the process , he meets gio's mistress gina zamora ( played by rosie vela ) and starts relationship with her too . \\nalthough it doesn't stink like many of the similar films can , inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine . \\nnobody in this film actually puts much effort , including madsen or lynch , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke . \\nthe only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela , who , apart from showing her more than impressive looks , shows some of the singing talent too . \\nhowever , this isn't reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would , in most likelihood , forget the next day . \\n\",\n"," b\"in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer . \\nthe movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc . \\nhe manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) . \\nunfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous . \\nher connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events . \\nalthough few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label . \\npacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments . \\nlow budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film . \\nunfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed . \\ninstead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill's attempts of serious acting . \\nall of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's precious time . \\n\",\n"," b\"vannesa kensington : `austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : `i don't know baby , i've never looked ! ' \\nand so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season . \\naustin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity . \\nthe mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place . \\nmyers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr . evil , who is given much of the spotlight here . \\nthere's an early scene in which dr . evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself . \\nmost of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were . \\nhappily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr . evil and the other guests . \\n ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! ! \\nyou want a piece of me ? ' ) \\nthe audience was in stitches . \\nthere are many good things about this sequel . \\ndr . evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry . \\nmini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all . \\nmindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber . \\nthis works surprisingly well . \\nafterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment . \\noh , yes . . . \\nthe plot . \\nafter a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr . evil . \\nin the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods . \\nhere , it's time travel . \\ndr . evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber . \\nthere , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless . \\nmeanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle . \\nonce back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr . evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon . \\nin one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star' . \\nif there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me . \\nap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers . \\nbut what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss . \\nwhile myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits . \\nthe hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner . \\nrobert wagner , as dr . evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character . \\none nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee . \\nthere are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina ) . \\nbut myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny . \\ndon't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination . . . . \\nof the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression . \\nher performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her . \\nand as for fat bastard . . . \\nwell , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far . \\nbut my most severe complaint : mr . bigglesworth was only in one scene ! ! \\nbut , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that . \\nthis sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it's more often than not a laugh riot . \\nand , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection . \\nif myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more .

knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes . \\ndeep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking . \\nthe repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there\\'s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation\\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \\nthen we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense . \\nthe mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there\\'s a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation\\'s crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem . \\nit goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail . \\nhow do we know this ? \\nbecause we\\'ve seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that \" the comet is still headed right for us \" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading . \\nladies and gentlemen , that is the movie . \\nsuccessful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots . \\ntelevision is what\\'s wrong with deep impact . \\nthe main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that\\'s the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy . \\nshe thinks it\\'s an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area . \\nwhen she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps . \\n \" i know you\\'re just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . \" \\nshe figures out what\\'s really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet . \\nupon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question . \\nand everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you\\'re a star . \\nleoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet\\'s collision course with earth . \\nand i\\'m sure it\\'s comforting for her to know that , even though the world\\'s ending in a matter of months , she\\'s a cable news personality . \\nso there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up . \\nsuch personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process . \\nbut as anyone who\\'s seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail . \\nthey only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth . \\nyeah , thanks , nasa . \\nthat\\'s when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren\\'t picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years . \\nthey even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave . \\nif the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie . \\ninstead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town . \\nthe reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location . \\nand , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks . \\ni\\'m sure it\\'s comforting to know that , even though the world\\'s ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives . \\n',\n"," b'i looked at the \" internet movie database \" \\'s awards section for this film , and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for \" best picture ( drama ) . \" \\nanyone who\\'s seen this film can back me up on this : this is the worst of the \" great \" disaster films , and that\\'s not really saying a lot for this film . \\n \" earthquake \" is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured . \\non video , it\\'s a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite ) , then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster . \\nwhile this worked in , say , \" the towering inferno , \" it doesn\\'t here for one single reason : we don\\'t care about any of the characters . \\nthe film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made , including \" skyjacked \" and that classic , \" soylent green \" ) as a rich man married to ava gardner , who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy , in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree , right after his \" shaft \" thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down ( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal , and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair ( ! ! ! ) . \\nin smaller subplots , there\\'s a pointless bit about people who are flying over l . a .

frames ) ; there\\'s genieveve bujold\\'s moron son , who has a little adventure with wires ; and for some much-needed comedy , there\\'s walter matthau ( billed as walter mutha . . . . \\n- the only laugh in the film ) , as a wild drunkard , who\\'s big moment is a dance he does at a critical time . \\nas for the actual \" earthquake , \" it\\'s rather a let-down . \\nthere\\'s a full hour of character-setups , none of which is interesting , then about 10 minutes of shaking , crumbling , and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold ( narrowly missing ) . \\nthis film needed that whole theatre-shaking : they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored . \\nthere\\'s little suspense following the quake , although this film tries for it . \\nthere\\'s an adventure in a crumbling high-rise office building , the wires with the kid , and the movement of people who are all injured . \\nbut none of these are all-too suspenseful . \\nthe finale with the heston/gardner/bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip-of-the-coin bit , which brings out a big let-down . \\nand there\\'s no real finale . \\neven \" volcano \" ended nicely , and that movie really sucked . \\nnot only is it hokey , but you don\\'t care about any character . \\nwho cares if heston dies ? \\nwho cares if he choses bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner , mainly on the basis that she can actually act ) ? \\nwho cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid \" stunt ? \" \\nwho cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires ? \\nand who cares about that whole plane spiel ? \\nif anything , \" earthquake \" is worth a viewing for the same reason \" glen or glenda ? \" \\nis . \\ni mean , i laughed at this more than i did at \" bio

after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry . \\nshe can\\'t go higher than him . \\nhe won\\'t allow it . \\nand what\\'s amazing about \" election \" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor . \\nearly in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher . \\nit\\'s like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they

foreign lands , it\\'s the russian _mafia_ . \\na perfect solution , it combines the dread of organized crime and the still-present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries . \\nbest of all , the villains are still foreigners : fear of the other always plays best . \\nso it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid . \\nthe fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they\\'re not sure even exists . \\ncoming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina

international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . ) \\nthe film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn\\'t slip away . \\ncrossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers . \\nbeing very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller \" the day of the jackal \" , comparison between the two films is inevitable . \\nthere is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action/adventure . \\nas a mystery , \" the jackal \" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there\\'s entertainment to be had . \\nholes ? let\\'s see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up . \\nfor a 20-year veteran that can command the

nowhere . \\nthe romance between phillippe and cambell , as a soap opera star , is completely implausable . \\nthe two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old

keyes ( eugene levy , \" best in show \" ) , his only recourse is to return in another body . \\nhe chooses that of charles wellington , the tenth richest man in the united states . \\nof course , wellington is not only rich , but white and 53 years old , which makes lance\\'s bid for closing night at the apollo , as well as his desire to woo suntee ( regina taylor , \" jerry maguire \" ) , a tad tricky . \\nthe original elaine may/warren beatty script has been reworked by chris rock , lance crouther , ali leroi , and louis c . k . \\nto turn beatty\\'s vehicle as a football player into rock\\'s vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor . \\nas directed by chris weitz and paul weitz ( codirectors of \" american pie \" and costars of \" chuck & buck \" ) , the whole affair comes off as amateur hour . \\ninitial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals . \\nproduction values are shoddy . \\nmost serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate . \\nthis problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen . \\nrock does get the chance to do some fun schtick , such as his turnaround on wellington\\'s plans for a poor neighborhood hospital ( \\'bullet in the head ? \\nyou got a bed ! \\' ) , but he\\'s uneven when interacting with the rest of the cast . \\nregina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for the man she believed to be her nemesis . \\nalso good is frankie faison ( \" hannibal \" ) as whitney , lance\\'s compassionate manager - the only human who\\'s made privy to lance\\'s body body switch . \\nchaz palminteri and levy are pretty much wasted as heaven\\'s ambassadors .

for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story . \\nperhaps the musketeer , a new film that \" reimagines \" the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix , is one adaptation too many . \\nit\\'s just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent , repetitive action sequences . \\nthis time , d\\'artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers , who can\\'t even pronounce his character\\'s name . \\nas a boy , he watched his father get killed by febre ( tim roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry cardinal richelieu . \\nhe vowed to have vengeance . \\nafter undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy . \\non his

cardinal\\'s own guards . \\nonly a few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them athos and portos ( who are only figureheads in this movie ) . \\ntogether with d\\'artagnan , they fight to extricate the queen ( catherine deneuve ) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant . \\noh , and as an afterthought , d\\'artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( mena suvari ) . \\njust thought i\\'d mention that . \\nnow , look : i don\\'t know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue-lashing . \\ni have nothing against \" modernizing \" classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side effects . \\ndirector peter hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days , has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas\\' masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie . \\ninstead , we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing . \\nwhen the musketeers finally get to holler \" all for one , and one for all , \" i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt . \\nmaybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams\\'s tone , which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader\\'s digest condensed version of the story that he gives us . \\nit\\'s as though anything that may have been construed as \" fun \" was purposely expunged from the production . \\nthe joylessness of the proceedings , from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes , can be felt in every frame . \\nchambers can\\'t act ; suvari , roth and deneuve can , but aren\\'t given the chance . \\nand when push comes to shove , the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious , though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit . \\nsome movies seem sloppy and careless , clearly made for a quick buck . \\nwith the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful . \\nthe film is intricate , stylish and precise , hitting the wrong note every single time . \\n',\n"," b'susan granger\\'s review of \" the watcher \" ( universal ) \\njust what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga . \\nthis time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd . \\nto taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too . \\nbefore long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again . \\nin the midst of this murderous frenzy , there\\'s spader\\'s psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in \" the cell . \" \\nwriters david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves\\' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop \" need each other to give meaning to our lives . \" \\nplus , as reeves explains , \" we\\'re all stacked right on top of each other , but we don\\'t notice each other any more . \" \\nafter that , it\\'s all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack . \\njames spader\\'s acting technique can be described as \\'wooden deadpan\\' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone \\'dude\\' persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn\\'t . \\nchris ellis , as spader\\'s self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing . \\non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" the watcher \" is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it . \\n',\n"," b\"sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality . \\nhe is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict . \\nbut , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers that hamper lumet's reputation . \\na stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category . \\nthe heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york . \\nduring one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result , she becomes depressed . \\nin order to help her recover , bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community . \\nemily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder . \\nconcluding that the perpetrator belongs to community , she decides to go undercover . \\nthat isn't easy , because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways . \\nthings get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) . \\nusing peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film . \\neven the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent . \\nbut the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith . \\nthe author of this review never liked this actress very much , but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles . \\nrole of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them . \\nfirst of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter , and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better . \\nscreenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots ( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) . \\nbut , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) , and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth when the scenes take place in hassidic community . \\nalso , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture . \\nthat is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time . \\n\",\n"," b' * * * be warned . . . \\nthe following review contains some harsh language * * * \\nthe blair witch project . \\nquite possibly the least scariest movie of all time . \\nif you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy . \\nmy colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing is more . \\nand this worked for him . \\nwell , i\\'m sorry , but nothing . . . \\nis nothing ! ! ! ! ! \\nnothing is not more . \\nit\\'s nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! ! . \\ni do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing . \\n \" nothing \" is free , available all around the world at a location near you . \\ni am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary . \\ni could just discount them and say , \" well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow . \" \\nbut i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that doesn\\'t hold water . \\nthere must be some other reason . \\n ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i\\'ll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction . ) \\nwhen i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97% of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost . \\nthey only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time . \\nthis being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout \" josh ! ! \" \\nover and over . \\nthis film should not be called the blair witch project , it should more accurately be called three dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost . . . \\nand argue with each other . \\noh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting \" josh ! ! \" . \\nand if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear . \\noh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks . \\nyou\\'ve never seen terror like this folks , and you don\\'t want to . \\nthe chevy chase/goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film . \\n ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience . ) \\nthis film is an example of marketing with no substance . \\nthe marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film . \\nthey want this film to be good . \\nand i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they don\\'t have anything else to praise . \\nthat wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not it . \\nthis film could have been so much better . \\njust think , if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost , and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff . \\ni saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it . \\nshe was sold on this film . \\nand then , at one point during it , she turned to me and asked \\' . . . are \\nwe supposed to be scared by this ? \\' . \\ni\\'ve heard one opinion that you \" have to use your imagination \" to create the fear in this movie . \\nwell , i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do . \\nuse their imagination and create a good movie . \\ni mean anyone can use their imagination and not pay 5 bucks for it . \\nbut even if you like this idea , then what are you imagining ? \\nan entity called the blair witch ? \\nsome rednecks fucking with these kids ? \\nare either of these things really scary when you think about it ? ? ? \\ni\\'ve heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something . \\nwell sure thats scary in real life , but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting . \\nyou could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary , but in a film it wouldn\\'t be . \\nand no , a movie does not need a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy . \\nactually the less the better ( see the equally awful remake of the haunting ) . \\nbut you have to do something . \\nyou cant just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary , if it were real . \\nand by the way , about the shakycam filming in blair witch . \\naren\\'t these supposed to be \" filmmakers \" who should know how to point a camera and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly ? \\ni\\'m not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified , that\\'s justified . \\ni\\'m talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can\\'t seem to shoot anything smoothly at all . \\nminor quibble there . \\nthere is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers . \\nthat the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank . \\nand i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves \" what was i thinking ? ? \" . \\nbut , if they don\\'t , then thats fine . \\nif it works for them then that\\'s okay i guess . \\ni just lament that by making this movie a hit , we are going to be subjected to more of the \" nothing is more \" approach . \\npretty soon we\\'re going to get some movies like this : just a still shot of a prison jail cell . \\nfor 90 minutes . \\nand we\\'ll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves , \" my god , wouldn\\'t it be scary to spend life in prison ? ! ! \\nthis movie is the scariest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ! \" . \\nor , a shot of a coffin , with some funeral directors arguing with each other . \\n \" man , do

the fight itself , for what a fight it was . \\nthanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman . \\nfans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore . \\nwith the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life . \\nbut \" when we were kings \" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match . \\nquestions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary . \\ngast could hardly choose otherwise , considering the vocal , uncompromising politics of muhammad ali . \\na member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast\\'s film with a forceful swipe at the united states . \\nwhen ali hollers \" damn america\\' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind . \\nhis decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : \" no viet cong ever called me nigger \" , ali reasons . \\ndespite showcasing ali\\'s proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of \" when we were kings \" is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion . \\nlistening to the film\\'s numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this \" rumble in the jungle \" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map . \\nspike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a \" coming home \" to africa . \\nforeman reminds us that africa is the \" cradle of civilisation \" . \\nfair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality . \\nit is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator . \\nwhile ali respects mobutu\\'s ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well-stocked torture chambers . \\nmailer\\'s insights are lost on most of the film\\'s commentators . \\ngeorge plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire . \\nwith admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire\\' s squalid ruling elite . \\nmobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power . \\ndon king , resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the \" messiah \" label attributed to him by a loyal disciple , passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity . \\nunderstandably , foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal . \\nhe may be , as one sympathiser notes , \" blacker \" than ali , but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali , the thuggish mobutu , and the tacky huckster don king . \\nafrica , zaire , inspirational leader or vicious dictator , all is left undifferentiated , unconsidered , in this optimistic celebration of black unity . \\nlittle wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali\\'s opponent wasn\\'t white . \\nadmittedly , these issues are only hinted at , rather than substantially explored . \\nthe audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves , in their own time . \\nthere is just too much to cover , too much that is truly worthy of celebration , for a protracted political analysis to be justified . \\nthe excitement of james brown and b . b king in concert , for instance . \\nand of course there\\'s always ali to consider , as he shamelessly , and hilariously , hams it up in front of the camera , shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another - \" we gonna get it on coz we don\\'t get along ! \" . \\ndoubtlessly , considering the multi-faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover , the makers of \" when we were kings \" faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues , and what personalities , best deserved their attention . \\nfortunately , by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter , they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event . \\n',\n"," b\"the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\nthat's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot . \\nsuch an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment . \\none need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent . \\nthe trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist . \\nyou will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less . \\nthose who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house . \\nothers will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness . \\nlawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) . \\ndangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) . \\nsherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma . \\nindeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming . \\nthat leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows . \\nbig momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs . \\ndoubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman . \\nunfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters . \\nsuspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other . \\nof course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny . \\nand it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry . \\nunfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) . \\nmartin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character . \\nhe's just big momma without the makeup on . \\ni won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers . \\nthere are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) . \\ni'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way . \\nthe gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs . \\nits lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant . \\nbig momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny . \\nit's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress . \\n\",\n"," b\"there is a rule when it comes to movies . \\na sequel is never as good as the original . \\nthere are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them . \\nnow if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this isn't even the first sequel to it , you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience . \\ndon't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) . \\nthey made this movie before they were stars . \\njudging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons . \\nit's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey . \\napparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger . \\napparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day . \\nand i don't blame them , they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them . \\nunfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character . \\nwhile mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control . \\n ( hey , don't say i didn't warn you . ) \\nto make matters worse , leatherface , the chainsaw wielding maniac , who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times , has now become a full blown cross-dresser , and spends the entire movie in drag . \\nthere is a plot to this movie but it isn't worth mentioning . \\nlet's just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time and are left to the mercy of remote control man ( mcconaughey ) and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half-witted sidekick . \\nman , i can't get over just how bad this movie is . \\nthis film has absolutely no redeeming qualities . \\neven the obligatory topless babe shot wasn't enough to hold my interest for more than 2 seconds . \\nthe writing is bad , the direction is even worse , but both of those things look good in comparison to the acting . \\nthis is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch . \\na guarantee you , if criminals thought that they would be subjected to this film they would never break the law again . \\n\",\n"," b'so much for sweet returns . \\nafter smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80\\'s slasher movies , starting with 1996\\'s \" scream , \" and followed by \" scream 2 , \" \" urban legend , \" and the original , \" i know what you did last summer , \" a film like , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" was bound to be made sooner or late . \\nit is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking , favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits . \\nit has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean . \\nsince then , julie has relocated to boston university , and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams , she has been able to put her life back together . \\nwhen julie\\'s friend , karla ( brandy ) , is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is , she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people , which also includes karla\\'s horny boyfriend , tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddie prinze jr . , also returning from the original ) , doesn\\'t show up . \\nwhen they reach the secluded island , they discover it is the last day of the open season , and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them . \\nof course , julie , her friends , and the workers aren\\'t the only ones there , as the murderous ben willis , dressed in fisherman garb , returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all . \\nit is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" is made . \\ni am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to \" ikwydls , \" which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a \" friday the 13th \" movie . \\nwhile the original focused more on the story and characters , as well as genuinely suspenseful moments , thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didn\\'t return to write the sequel , and it shows ) , \" i still know . . . \" \\nhas no story to speak of , and is so vacuous of ideas , that the filmmakers , were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested . \\nalso gone are any signs of character development , and since every single character died before i got to know them , all i was left with was to stare at the screen , indifferent to what was going on . \\nwhile i cared about the fates of the characters in the original , it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died . \\nthey were all paper-thin and pointless , except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman . \\nanother element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set-pieces , like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar , but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy ) . \\nsince so many people were killed every couple minutes , the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water . \\nalso of note is the mystery of the second killer , and accomplice to ben , but it is obvious from the first frame who it is , and so i couldn\\'t even have fun at that , like i did in the \" scream \" movies and , \" urban legend . \" \\nit figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again , a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else . \\nmaybe the people who made , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" should have realized that in order to make a good movie , you must have a screenplay---or at least one that isn\\'t such a black hole for thoughts and ideas . \\nthe ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part , but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel , everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead . \\n',\n"," b\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nto assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent . \\nit would be derisive . \\nit would be glib . \\nit would be dismissive . \\nit would be entirely accurate . \\nrarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging . \\nthe film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous . \\nthe film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables . \\ndespite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities . \\nconsequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent . \\nlouise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene . \\n ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . ) \\nmeanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice . \\nserenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky . \\nit could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest . \\nit is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past . \\nnone of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes . \\ndirector alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one . \\nwhile tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization . \\nto his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies . \\ni caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened . \\nto be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question . \\nthe winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing . \\nthe film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching . \\n\",\n"," b\"my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel . \\ni was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . \\nand when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . \\nthe film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . \\ni particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . \\ni also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . \\nat this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene . \\nit is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . \\nhowever , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . \\noff the high board . \\nsuddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball . \\nup until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk . \\nif he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . \\nbut now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . \\nindeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . \\nthis includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . \\nwhile i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . \\nand the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . \\nat this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' \\nthen i realized he was , and i was watching it . \\nin the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . \\nnote : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . \\nmax went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid . \\nher refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . \\ni found this scene offensive . \\nnot only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . \\ni think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . \\nlate in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . \\nthis could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! \\n`my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . \\na stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person . \\nin this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . \\nsentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . \\ninstead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max . \\ncrystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . \\n\",\n"," b'john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel . \\nyou send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information . \\nit may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn\\'t require a magical faster-than-light drive . \\nin the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . \\nabout thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . \\nafa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer\\'s analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . \\nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . \\naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . \\ndennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . \\nfeldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . \\nnow , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . \\nspecies features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . \\nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . \\nthe species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . \\n ( note that , in the 1970\\'s , we really didn\\'t know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . \\neven today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don\\'t have it analyzed yet . ) \\nthe answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . \\nthe script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . \\nthe first half of the film has something to offer , as \" sil , \" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . \\nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . \\nher instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . \\nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . \\nshe goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . \\nthe pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . \\nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . \\nwhitaker\\'s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation\\'s \" counselor cleavage . \" \\nthe other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . \\nkingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . \\nh . r . giger\\'s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . \\nthe main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn\\'t live up to it . \\nall we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . \\nthere is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of \" scare \" scenes stuck together . \\nthe movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them . \\non the other hand , as an exercise in sci-fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . \\nspecies earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it\\'s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . \\nmy personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don\\'t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters . \\nmpaa classification : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sex , language ) \\nstars : ben kingsley , michael

tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems . \\nthe script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television . \\nthe characters are paper-thin and the interesting ideas purely non-existent . \\nthis is a decrement-life-by-90-minutes card . \\n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \\njalla ! jalla ! \\nis basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen . \\nit tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love . \\nthe film is set in sweden where roro and mans ( fares fares and torkel petersson ) are custodians at a public park . roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely , mans is a swede from a much more liberal background . \\nthey spend most of the day in the bushes at their park , cleaning up after dogs . \\nroro and mans each have girlfriends , but each has a problem . \\nroro ( nicknamed \" jalla \" ) is having family problems . \\nit seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman , yasmin ( laleh pourkarim ) , but he is already in love with lisa ( tuva novotny ) . \\nyasmin likes roro , but does not want to get married either . \\nmans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence . \\nthe two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other . \\nmans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers . \\nthe one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them . \\nroro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other , but then plan to break up before the wedding . \\nnot too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected . \\nthe plot turns in several places are contrived . \\none knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen . \\nlebanese-born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer . \\nwhen things start to get slow , he just adds throws in another story . \\nfor example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film . \\ncharacterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function . \\nwe do see some of roro\\'s family life and his concerns . \\nthat may be because roro\\'s background is a lot like that of the director . \\nwhile the story was entertaining , i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film . \\nit was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life . \\none does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this . \\ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n"," b'200 cigarettes takes place on new year\\'s eve 1981 . \\nmonica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year\\'s party . \\neveryone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things . \\nthis is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes . \\nas we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all . \\nthis disappointed me greatly . \\nthe film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion . \\nlucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd . \\nthe two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that . \\nthis subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that . \\njaneane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin . \\nshe plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin\\'s . \\nthis subplot is completely a waste of garofalo\\'s talent . \\nthere was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie . \\nwhen lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed . \\nthe bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica\\'s party . \\nat the bar , he runs into two more girls . \\nthe girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don\\'t even remember their characters names . \\nben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn\\'t go anywhere so he doesn\\'t have much screen time to give a good performance . \\nfeatherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad . \\nchristina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie . \\nthe two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost . \\nthey meet some guys and end up going around with them all night . \\nthis subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie\\'s accent . \\nhoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good . \\nshe was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress . \\nanother subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn\\'s daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr . \\njack is an actor who doesn\\'t care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn\\'t . \\nkate hudson is a huge klutz . \\nshe gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie . \\nthey are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well . \\nthis subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson\\'s performance . \\nmohr wasn\\'t good , but he wasn\\'t bad . \\nhe was just alright , which i didn\\'t find acceptable . \\nthere is not much to say about the performances in the film . \\nnone of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not . \\nthe only performances that i can judge are christina ricci\\'s as always good performance , kate hudson\\'s funny role , courtney love\\'s mediocre performance , and paul rudd\\'s annoying and overused performance . \\ni was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo . \\nthe two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes . \\nmartha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 . \\nthe soundtrack is full of 1980\\'s tunes , ranging from \" i want candy \" to \" tainted love . \" \\nthe songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s . \\nduring the film , i often found myself asking the questions , \" is there a reason to this ? \\nis there any moral story ? \\nis there a point ? \\nare any of the events going on in the film necessary ? \\ndo i care what lucy and kevin are going through ? \" \\nthe movie is extremely boring , and by the time they reached eleven-o-clock , one hour before midnight , i could not wait for the movie to be over . \\nthe plot is okay , but the subplots make it terrible . \\nmaybe if the film was about the party , not about the people at the party , it could have been a lot better . \\nthe bottom line : just like a slasher movie , this ? 80s comedy is just one too many . \\n',\n"," b\"i don't box with kid gloves . \\ni don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film . \\ni consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic . \\nhowever , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery . \\nrigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time . \\ni still , however , will not go easy on them . \\nthey recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it . \\nin the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets . \\nwell , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence . \\nthe point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me . \\nsure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable . \\ndown with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber's manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report . \\nlike the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail . \\nthe best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s . \\na dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . ' \\nin down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent . \\nwith an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . \\nagain , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about . \\nthe film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . \\nthe plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . \\nfrom there we go into a delightful parody . \\nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . \\nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . \\nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . \\nfor once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . \\ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . \\nit's almost as much fun as the film . \\n\",\n"," b'the crown jewel of 1970\\'s irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all-star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship . \\nthe story begins on the u . s . s . \\nposeidon\\'s big new year\\'s cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive . \\nlet\\'s see , there\\'s the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to \" pray to that part of god within yourself . \" \\nthere\\'s the ex-cop ( borgnine ) who busted a hooker ( stella stevens ) six times -- then married her . \\nthere\\'s the hippie singer ( \" there\\'s got to be a morning after . . . \" ) who turns to the company of a lonely man ( red buttons ) once her brother is killed . \\nand to round out the group : the elderly couple ( jack albertson and shelley winters ) who live aboard the ship , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall . \\nwe get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure , before straight- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship . \\neveryone\\'s in the giant ballroom at the time , shortly past midnight of the new year , when the ship turns first on its side , then completely upside down . \\nthe second- in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives , but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship . \\nin this case , because the ship is overturned , the top is the bottom . \\nor is the bottom the top ? \\neither way , we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- christmas trees . \\nthus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors , through burning rooms , etc . while the ship slowly fills with water behind them . \\nit\\'s a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting . \\nthe poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at , with all the melodrama that comes in-between the non-thrilling action scenes . \\nthe one note in borgnine\\'s one-note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love ( although since there isn\\'t a sex scene , we never find out if his buttons really are red ) and albertson and winters wonder if they\\'ll live to see their grandson\\'s birth . \\nshelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end , where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along . \\nwinters , who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie ( stevens even not-so- affectionately calls her \" fatass \" in one scene ) , finally finds her purpose . \\n \" i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen , \" she brags , and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years , she\\'s swimming through the water , her skirt billowing up around her hips , showing off her cellulite ( or do you call it shellulite ? ) \\nridden thighs . \\nit\\'s not so much funny as innately disgusting , which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole . \\n',\n"," b'the 13th warrior reeks so badly of melodrama and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canine\\'s least appetizing residue . \\nthe best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white and you hope that the film has slipped and caught ablaze in the projector . \\nmy vote goes for the ending credits , where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you . \\nibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another man\\'s wife . \\nhe encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men . \\nfahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter . \\nthe movie proves to be a new low point for banderas , who\\'s acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993\\'s philadelphia , than that of a warrior . \\nin the film\\'s supposed pay off scene , he exclaims \" i was wrong , these are not men ! \" , \\na line intended to be the most memorable quote of the production . \\nunfortunately , banderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chase\\'s career look like oscar material . \\nthe film , based on michael crichton\\'s best selling novel , eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three years ago , and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony , but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow . \\nat the same time , the 13th warrior makes you think about numerous questions . \\nquestions like \" why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark ? \" , \\n \" why does no one ever have blood cover both sides of their face , but rather just one side ? \" \\nand finally , \" will the manager give me a refund ? \" \\n90 minutes into the 103 minute film , a man invites of the warriors \" come with me , there is a woman who can help . \" \\nunfortunately , there is nothing that could help this film . \\nthe most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join hands , form a chorus line , and break into a rendition of \" springtime for hitler . \" \\n',\n"," b'when you\\'ve run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games . \\nwhy did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ? \\nthe quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw . \\nthis film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack . \\nthe plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the \" outworld \" , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity . \\nthe good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined . \\nhere\\'s the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who\\'s on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who\\'s on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity\\'s safety for another generation . \\nhow this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana\\'s line , \" i knew love would keep us together , \" since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh . \\nthere are some seriously stupid things in this movie . \\ntake , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the \" inner winds \" , generated by earth\\'s magma flows . \\nyou get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast . \\nhow fast ? \\nas katana says , \" you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all . \" \\nwhat ? \\nlater , sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn \" red \" williams , otherwise known as \" saber \" on tv\\'s american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu . \\nhow do we know this is where she went ? \\nthere\\'s a sign on the facility\\'s perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu , hawaii . \\nremember , this is not a caption , but an actual sign . \\ni guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are . \\nthere\\'s a lot of major flipping action , too . \\nthe first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another . \\ndo they land and immediately get into the fighting ? \\ndoes one of them land first and catch the other off guard ? \\ndo they collide in mid-air ? \\nno , apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away . \\nwhy did they need those metal balls to travel ? \\neveryone could have just flipped from point a to point b . \\ni have to admit , the fight scenes are pretty good , although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires , allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics . \\nthe movie\\'s thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly . \\n \" ouch \" was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one . \\nyou could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights , not plot , would be the main draw , since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next . \\nit seems that\\'s all there is in this movie . \\nmaybe it is . \\nas i had mentioned , the acting is bad . \\nthere\\'s not one solid performance in the film , although williams as jax was pretty funny . \\nafter a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling , jax says , \" you look good in mud . \\nno , really , you do . \" \\nremar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously , and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang . \\nbrian thompson , who has played good guys , bad guys , and even an alien on tv\\'s the x-files , but always some muscle-bound behemoth , is your average evil demi-god , but it\\'s more the script\\'s fault than his own that he doesn\\'t have anything original to say . \\nthe one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half . \\nanother thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking , blood only appears in one scene . \\nall in all , mortal kombat : annihilation is loud , violent , shallow , and marketed toward kids . \\nhey , just like the video game ! \\n',\n"," b' * * * the following review contains some harsh language . . . \\nbut what did you expect when you clicked on this title ? \\n *

lover , april ( kristen holly smith ) , has just received a telegram from her ex-fiance . \\nisle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive musical comedy about april pfferpot ( smith ) , a resident of the small town of bumfuck , arkansas who is about to get married to high school sweetheart and football hero dick dickson ( michael dotson ) . \\nwhen april gets extreme cold feet she runs home , sticks a gun in her mouth , and pulls the trigger . \\ninstead of killing herself , she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos , an alternate dimension where lesbians rule and no men are allowed ( except for lance , the homosexual toilet cleaner/slave ) . \\napril loves her new home and friends , but dick and her parents are not so ready to give her up . \\nmr . and ms . pfferpot ( director jeff b . harmon and janet krajeski ) decide they need medical help so they enlist the aid of dr . sigmoid colon ( also jeff b . harmon ) , who claims he can cure homosexuality . \\nin actuality , dr . colon is homosexual as well and begins his special \" treatment \" on dick dickson ( unbeknownst to dick ) . \\nwhen april turns down dick\\'s demand for her to return to bumfuck , he decides to take matters in his own hands and attack the isle of lesbos rambo-style . \\ninstead of leveling the place he falls in love with lance ( alex boling ) and the two of them , along with april and her lover blatz , get married . \\n ( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i\\'m assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? ) \\napril\\'s parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . \\nthe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the \" circuitry \" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . \\nmr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . \\ni\\'m not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . \\neither way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . \\nthe film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about \" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews \" . \\nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can\\'t help but feel like he had some serious intent . \\nas for the entire central theme of the movie , i\\'m afraid that it\\'s one that i just don\\'t get . \\ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . \\nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . \\nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? \\ni\\'m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don\\'t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren\\'t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . \\nagain , maybe i\\'m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . \\nas far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . \\ndespite the disturbing visuals , \" mom and apple pie \" stuck with me for the rest of the day . \\nspeaking of disturbing visuals , \" wedding bells ain\\'t ringing \" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . \\n \" i\\'m a lesbian \" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . \\nit\\'s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . \\nthe other performers are decent , save for the rosie o\\'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . \\ni have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . \\none particular musical number , \" lesbian rock \" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . \\nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . \\nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( \" lesbian rock \" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . \\nonce the \" isle of lesbos reprise \" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . \\nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? \\nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . \\nthe transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . \\nin many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . \\nthis film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . \\nif you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . \\ni , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . \\nwait . aren\\'t gladiator films considered to be . . . \\noh , never mind . \\n',\n"," b'a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it . \\nit turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre . \\nthough it\\'s a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising . \\nit\\'s made for the gentle art-house set , those who don\\'t want something too disturbing to think about . \\nit\\'s about a critically successful writer husband , alec ( pryce ) , who is so self-absorbed that he\\'s threatened by his department store floor-walking model wife , kate ( bouquet ) , who wants to be a writer . \\nshe meets his crass publisher , vanni corso ( walken ) , another self-absorbed man , and a predictable relationship occurs . \\nthe fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband\\'s first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet . \\nshe now wants her own identity and her independence . \\nthe film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie . \\nthe film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax . \\nit\\'s set in london , and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper , vanni . \\nshe later meets him as her hubby\\'s new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality , and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel . \\nalec who is an obnoxious grouse , someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with , tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published--which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni . \\nthe publisher is proud that he\\'s a mamma\\'s boy who never married and is a self-made man who has earned millions . \\nhe has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it , as he proudly tells kate : \" if my father could sell pizzas in harlem , i could sell culture in europe . \" \\nthe only thing that couldn\\'t be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line . \\nthe mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy . \\nshe soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon-to-become-beleaguered vanni . \\nwhen she writes a second novel , he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did . \\nit ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper . \\na business affair was loosely based on the real-life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly , in their celebrated 1950s love triangle . \\n',\n"," b'depending on who you ask , the original sin was either the eating of the apple , the act of disobedience against god , or the act of betrayal . \\nbut in case you didn\\'t know this , don\\'t bother remembering it . . . \\nthe words \" original sin \" never come up in the movie of the same name , let alone the concept of it . \\nthe closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative ( the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba , circa 1900 ) . \\nregardless of its senseless title , original sin does actually have a plot ( albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war , based on the book waltz across darkness ) . \\nboy ( antionio banderas ) places personal ad sometime around 1900 , searching for a wife . \\nsince this is a century ago , we narrowly dodge a remake of green card , only to find that the girl ( jolie ) faked her photo and is actually beautiful . \\nskipping a few moderately useless sex scenes ( getting the question out of the way , yes , we get to see angelina jolie\\'s breasts again ) , the girl turns out to be a con artist , swindles boy for his money , and heads for the hills . \\noriginal sin then briefly tries to be a thriller . \\nwe see boy go whore-chasing , saying he wants to find girl and kill her . \\nbut as soon as boy actually finds girl , instead of following what might have been a promising ( or at least not completely fucking boring ) thriller , the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since milk money . \\ngirl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past , all the while avoiding the \" other man , \" a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place . \\nadd insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history ( literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect ) , and acting roughly the caliber of a b . b . gun , and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer , definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year . \\ndon\\'t even bother with original sin , but if you do go , be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal . \\njust keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block , it\\'s much worse than a sin . \\nthis is sacrilege . \\n',\n"," b\"originally titled 'don't lose your head' , this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions . \\ntwo english fops , the 'powdered , be-wigged , be-ribboned' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine . \\ndue to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful . \\nffing becomes known as 'the black fingernail' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail . \\nafter the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen 'the big cheese' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him . \\n ( in fact , darcy and ffing are their coachmen ! ) \\nonce at calais , the fingernail meets jacqueline ( dany robin ) and they fall in love instantly . \\nhe tells her his identity and gives her his locket . \\nwhen camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby , he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline , thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail ! \\njacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert , his love desiree dubarry ( joan sims ) , and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail . \\nthey pretend to be of noble stock , calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante ( with bidet their assistant ) and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing . \\ndesiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck , but she ends up falling in love with him . \\nffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline , camembert has her moved to the 'chateau neuve' , and a climactic sword-fight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film ! \\na more complex story than most carry ons , this film enjoys good production values ( sets , costumes ) and an on-form cast . \\nsid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camembert's thick-witted crony . \\nother acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit . \\nalthough it suffers from a disasterously over-long sword fight at the end of the film , it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars , its slick and professional production , and its better-than-usual script . \\ndefinitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch . \\n\",\n"," b\"an attempt at florida film noir , palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels . \\nit's slow moving , uninvolving , and plain just uninteresting . \\nharry barber ( woody harrelson ) is an ex-newspaper man , just out of jail after being framed for a crime . \\nhis luck hasn't been the best , but things are looking up when a mysterious woman , rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , approaches him with a proposition . \\nshe wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter , odette ( chloe sevigny ) , pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $500 , 000 out of her stingy , but rich , husband felix ( rolf hoppe ) . \\nat first , all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone , and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10% ) . \\nbut , as the deed is carried out , things are not what they seem , and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm . \\npalmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film , but the effect never quite comes together . \\nit's got the sultry florida heat , seductive women , and even curvier plot twists , but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers . \\nsure , the right ingredients are there , but the end result is much too artificial . \\na lot of the problems lie with the script , which , though providing some genuine surprises , is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations . \\neven the plot twists don't seem to flow well with the rest of the story . \\nsome of them , for example , come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist ( for example : harry's spontaneous job offer , or the whole typewriter situation ) . \\nthe characters are mostly lifeless , played to type , but not much more . \\nwoody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick-headedness that it's hard to even picture him as an ex-journalist . \\nelisabeth shue vamps it up , but doesn't add anything special to the role . \\nchloe sevigny gives a terrible performance , trying to be a sexy 17-year old , but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth . \\nsome of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger , but , in the end , meaningless performances . \\nand to top it off , the pacing of the film is much too slow . \\nas the movie grinds to a halt , you're given too much time to wonder why you're wasting it watching palmetto . \\nif you're in the mood for this type of movie , you'd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir . \\n\",\n"," b'all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . \\nultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996\\'s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante\\'s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . \\nbut , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . \\nno number of name changes can help this picture . \\nit\\'s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . \\nhard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . \\nthe best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . \\nthe community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . \\nfrom that moment on , it\\'s all downhill . \\nwhatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . \\nit takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured . \\nbasically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs . \\nthere\\'s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . \\nit\\'s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren\\'t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . \\nthe film\\'s conclusion is so preposterous that it\\'s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . \\naction films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . \\ngraham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . \\nunfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . \\nthe action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . \\nwe see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again . \\nthe movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . \\nthe storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances . \\nthere\\'s tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . \\nhe and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv\\'s \" lou grant \" ) , get stuck on a street that\\'s rapidly turning into a river . \\na group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . \\nafter charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs . \\nas he swims and boats his way through huntingburg\\'s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . \\nthere isn\\'t any real acting in this film . \\nchristian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . \\ntom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . \\nrandy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . \\nmorgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . \\nfreeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time . \\nfollowing in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn\\'t trust nature\\'s fury as the chief engine of conflict . \\nas a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . \\ntitanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . \\nhard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . \\nthus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . \\nfortunately , there are only two elements left . \\n',\n"," b\"dr dolittle ( 20th century fox ) running time : 1 hour 25 minutes

had the ability to understand animals . \\nhowever , after being 'exorcised' he loses this ability , and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people ( most notably dr

happen . \\ndoctor dolittle , even with the excellent premise , rarely manages to raise a laugh . \\npoor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie , and his performance suffers . \\nthe manic murphy we saw in the 80's is gone , his more mature ( and more boring ) twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90's . \\nthe voices of the animals , which include albert brooks , chris rock ( the 'new' eddie murphy ) and norm mcdonald as 'lucky' the dog are marginally better , and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie . \\nsadly , most of their lines are pretty dumb . \\nand they're not 'funny' dumb , like dumb & dumber ( 1994 ) , but just boring dumb . \\nthe film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through , in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs . \\nthere are a few good jokes in the script , but they are few and far between . \\nif i had to choose a favourite performance , it would probably be albert brooks tiger , who has a certain charm about him . \\nsadly , he's barely in the movie , and rock's really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time . \\njoke wise , we are thankfully , spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor . \\nthe director , betty thomas , has , well , done better films . \\nshe bought us private parts ( 1997 ) and the brady bunch movie ( 1995 ) which were , sadly , much better than this . \\nthe scenes lack any charm , she just gets the job done . \\nthe animals themselves , are reasonable realistic , although most of them are obviously puppets . \\nthere's an impressive looking tiger , however , and the lip sync is pretty good . \\nyou'd have no problem guessing that most of the close up's are puppets , however , with their jilted movement . \\ni was hoping jim hensons workshop , who created the furry friends , would have done a better job . \\ndoctor dolittle , in the end , is a disappointment for everyone involved . \\nmurphy has done much better movies ( i . e \\ntrading places ) the director has seen better days , and even the creatures aren't that good . \\nthe target audience , aged between 7-13 , who are undemanding , will

\\nfollowing this sideshow of horror-lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non-stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter's life and mind . \\nmorris follows the trail of leuchter's madness with appalling lucidity , revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with : this leuchter guy is seriously messed up . \\nvirtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls , leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession ; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries , in spite of his lack of credentials . \\nafter a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows , leuchter came to the attention of neo-nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel , who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his `theory' that the holocaust never happened . \\nmorris's interviews are surprisingly congenial , drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves . \\nzundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch . \\nleuchter seems completely at ease , sometimes jovial . \\npart of this effect may be due to morris's new interviewing machine , called the interrotron , which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer . \\nthis was the first time morris had used the device , and the results are startling . \\ncombine the irony of these interviews with leuchter's reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau , not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant , and you've got one compelling and disturbing documentary . \\nwhile this film isn't for the feeble-minded or weak-hearted , it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape . \\naside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece , morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i , for one , feel bettered by the experience . \\n\",\n"," b'capsule : godawful \" comedy \" that\\'s amazingly shabby and cut-rate , and rather bereft of laughs . \\ni was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers : international man of mystery . \\ni desperately needed something to cheer me up , or at least distract me so i could get a clear head . \\nget some perspective . \\neven dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes . \\ni tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery . \\nmichael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five-minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago . \\nthe plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i don\\'t think i\\'m doing a disservice to the movie\\'s attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr . evil . \\nevil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture . \\npowers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with . \\nthe basic gag , that of powers\\' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with . \\nthe bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props . . . \\nthe movie\\'s amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions . \\none is dr . evil\\'s son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it\\'s a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for ) . \\na lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it\\'s desperate rather than clever . \\ninstead of skewering the whole thing , it\\'s a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute . \\nmyers himself is also desperate : he\\'s given an idea to play , not a character . \\nplus , the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy ( albeit \" nineties \" ) agent are a waste of time . \\ni wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her , only to have her deck him one . \\nwith a couple of exceptions , the movie misses all of its own best moments . \\nthe movie even looks cheesy , and not in a good way : i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi-def video or something , so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes . \\nthe whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap . \\nmy definition of comedy is simply : did it make me laugh ? \\nthe few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out . \\nthe most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson\\'s shorts and sent it sailing . \\n',\n"," b\"in double jeopardy , the stakes are high . \\nthink of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy , and then rearrange the details and the gender of the stalker . \\nthe finished product , although able to maintain the viewer's attention , is a predictable and unexciting thriller with an idiotic script . \\n`alex , i'll take homicide for $400 . . .

awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood and nick has strangely disappeared . \\nshe follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck , where she handles a fallen knife ( like any stupid character ) and is spotted by the coast guard , who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening . \\nnick is presumed dead , and although she pleads her innocence , libby is tried and convicted for the murder of her husband . \\nnow , please don't think i'm spoiling any vital plot details , because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans . \\nif you haven't seen this preview , don't read any further . \\nbut seriously , the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg and douglas s . cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or three steps ahead of the characters . \\nduring the most vital scenes in the movie , i was anticipating every twist or `surprise' that eventually popped up on the screen . \\ni imagine the writers presume their core audience for double jeopardy is a very naive group of individuals . \\nmost , unfortunately , will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production . \\none is tommy lee jones , who plays travis lehman , a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby after she serves her sentence in prison . \\njones is always wonderful as an authority figure , and he's certainly familiar with this sort of role ( as he played so well in the fugitive and us marshals ) . \\njudd , as a likable heroin with gusto , also has a chance to flex her acting abilities . \\nwhile emotionally unconvincing , the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role , perking up the movie like an injection of anti-depressant . \\nthe actors , and their relationship together , present the one-two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely . \\nand now , back to the plot . \\nwhile behind bars , libby learns an interesting little bit of information : a person can't be convicted of the same crime twice . \\nthis law , called `double jeopardy' , could be her motive for hunting down her husband . . . \\nwho may still be alive . \\nyes , you heard right . \\nthe movie degenerates into a cross-country chase , where everything you expect to happen . . . \\ndoes . \\nthe final scenes , which could have redeemed the film , are poorly handled by director bruce beresford - whose previous work centers highly around drama ( driving miss daisy , paradise road ) . \\nironically , it is those elements - like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son - that don't quite work here . \\nat least double jeopardy is paced well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars . \\nunfortunately , jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive , and the real depth of his character is only skin deep . \\nbut he and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material , and both have some memorable comic moments . \\njudd , in particular , has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her `parole officer' . \\nhmmm . . . \\nperhaps this would have made a good comedy . \\nit is disappointing , because there are the makings of a competent action film here . \\nit's nicely shot and choreographed in downtown vancouver , and will entertain those who aren't turned off by the woeful story-line . \\n ? tis a shame that double jeopardy is an adult thriller that wouldn't fool most children . \\n\",\n"," b'in a flashback , the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film , the hanging garden , tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance . \\nhorrified , the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows \" the rule of 6 . \" \\nif you don\\'t break off a kiss by the count of 6 , then you committed a sin with the boy . \\nand most of all , the grandmother wants to know if she has \" protection ? \" \\nshe must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times . \\nthe richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style . \\nalthough some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture , that moniker misses the mark . \\nyes , every member of the household has their own special problems , but the writer didn\\'t choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident . \\nthis delightful little picture mixes love , tragedy and pathos , resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction . \\nduring the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story . \\nfirst , he\\'s an average sized young lad who is slapped off-screen by his father . \\nnext , he\\'s 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte . \\nwhen the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later . \\nwilliam is now an average-sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins . \\nwilliam has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free-spirited and foul-mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s . keller ) . \\nkerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy . \\nnicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary . \\nthe father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful . \\nhis wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids . \\nrounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine-year-old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time . \\nas the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home , william wanders off to try on one of his old coats , which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self . \\nthe director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways . \\nhe takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways . \\nrosmary\\'s trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated , and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath , all while talking to her brother . \\nas much as anything , the film is a series of character sketches . \\nin one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter , a homosexual one . \\nalthough he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast . \\na woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife , dusty miller ( martha irving ) , who , for a fee , will have heterosexual sex with william . \\nwith absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational . \\ndusty , after asking iris to watch her daughter , takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex . \\nall of this notwithstanding , he still prefers males . \\nthe film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face-to-face with himself when younger . \\nthis causes his ugly old memories to be reignited . \\nin the most devastating , he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself . \\neven here , the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker . \\nthe ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot . \\nthe hanging garden runs 1 : 31 . \\nit is rated r for strong sexuality , language , violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature . \\n',\n"," b'there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of \" scream queen \" in the

without hurting somebody ! \" ) . \\nthe killing starts before the train even leaves the station . \\nsince it\\'s new year\\'s , everyone\\'s wearing disguises ( a convenient plot device we\\'ve seen before ) , and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one\\'s looking . \\nat least one of the characters says it\\'s a groucho mask ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard , it looks

looks like that . \\nfor all its attempts at visual style and substance , terror train is more lionel than amtrak , more prom night than halloween , and nothing really worth watching . \\nonly die-hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield ( if he truly has any fans ) should even attempt to watch it . \\nand it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse .

whisperer is delicately made . \\ni dare say lyrical , since to many people\\'s ear , that word is synonymous with boring . \\nhardly . \\nthe horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise , but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch , especially in the final third of the story . \\nscott-thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter , and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell , especially since d . p . \\nrobert richardson\\'s photography casts montana as heaven on earth .

sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt , emotive performance as the nice-guy husband , who is as authoritive and likeable as tom . \\nhe is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist , lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating spouse\\'s motivation . \\nunfortunately , one of the horse whisperer\\'s only flaws is the chemistry between

\\nluckily ( and curiously ) , this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn\\'t quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought , the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters\\' complex relationships together . \\n',\n"," b'it\\'s time to take cover . \\nafter a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest . \\nin early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante\\'s peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar . \\nof the two , i had heard that dante\\'s peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . \\nthe film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town . \\nthe town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption . \\nflaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people . \\nwe see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing . \\nit is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road . \\nsymbolism doesn\\'t get much more blatant than that . \\nwe learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred . \\nharry survived , but his wife did not . \\na few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante\\'s peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) . \\nthere harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante\\'s peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop . \\nalthough the mayor doesn\\'t seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are . \\nthey are afraid that harry\\'s presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante\\'s peak . \\nthey would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug . \\nhowever , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath . \\nthus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption . \\nthis film contains a number of cliches . \\nthe amorous couple is one . \\nas soon as they doff their clothes , you know they\\'re going to die . \\nthe town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog . \\ncountless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable . \\nwatching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well . \\nunfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible . \\nfor example , harry\\'s boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation . \\npaul basically tells the townsfolk that harry\\'s eruption predictions aren\\'t cause for alarm . \\nthis causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work . \\nwhen paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , \" cause this town\\'s in trouble and i\\'m the best man you\\'ve got . \" \\neven better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving . \\nhe likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water . \\nif the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won\\'t move and will allow itself to be cooked . \\n \" is that your recipe for frog soup ? \" \\nasks one of the team members . \\n \" it\\'s my recipe for disaster , \" responds harry . \\ndante\\'s peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious . \\nour heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid . \\nmayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , \" acid eats metal . \" \\nthanks for the tip . \\nwhen we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there\\'s a caption labeling it as such . \\nthis wouldn\\'t have been so bad if it weren\\'t for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , \" u . s . geological survey . \" \\ni suppose the caption is for people who can\\'t read signs . \\nalthough harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why . \\nthere is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this . \\nwhen they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , \" why do they want to kiss ? \\nwere they even attracted to each other ? \" \\nif i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn\\'t even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act . \\nwho does he think he is ? \\njames bond ? \\nthe eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed . \\nthere are several \" warning signs \" prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don\\'t feel as if they are leading up to anything . \\nfor example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot . \\na tremor occurs . \\ndoes he plunge headlong to his death ? \\nis he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ? \\nno , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg . \\nthe sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well . \\nit wasn\\'t . \\none plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante\\'s peak . \\nin a disaster movie , there\\'s usually one guy who\\'s greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster . \\nit\\'s okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved . \\nif you\\'re going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way . \\nin dante\\'s peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don\\'t really try hard enough . \\nmaybe the mayor\\'s abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one . \\nfor no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt . \\nperhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate . \\nthere are a couple of good things about this movie . \\nthe first is the scenery . \\nthere are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful . \\nthe second is the special effects . \\nthey are the closest i\\'ve ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption . \\nbut when elements which don\\'t speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you\\'d probably better rewrite the script . \\n',\n"," b'the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment . \\nwith she\\'s all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance . \\nhowever , you wouldn\\'t know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker . \\nthis shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center . \\nthe most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma . \\nthey have accidentally killed one of their own , the \" teen dream \" , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday . \\nnow the three surviving girls must decide what to do . \\nit takes little time at all for the group\\'s leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up . \\nthe ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique\\'s final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience . \\nto make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth . \\nthe girls\\' cover is surely blown . . . \\nnot so fast . \\nthinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once-in-a-lifetime chance . \\nafter a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful \" new girl \" at school , and a full-fledged member of the popular crowd . \\ndoes this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ? \\nor will this finely honed plan crack over time ? \\njawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add . \\nit manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much-needed humor . \\nit is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn\\'t shackled to its dead-weight plot . \\nthe film\\'s most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo . \\nat this point , jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths . \\nbut then , all of a sudden , the innovation stops . \\nthe film becomes mired in the murder-and-cover-up plotting , which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film . \\nin the film , rose mcgowan fares the best . \\nas the manipulative clique leader , she truly dominates every scene she\\'s in ( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this , however ) . \\nit\\'s a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact . ) \\njawbreaker doesn\\'t quite know how to handle its semi-likable characters : fern and julie . \\neither one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows . \\nthe lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters . \\nas their motives become murky and unclear , the film finally falls to the point that it doesn\\'t really matter who wins or loses , since all sides have become equally detestable . \\n \" detestable \" is a good word to describe the film , jawbreaker . \\nit\\'s certain that , like the murder weapon described in the film\\'s title , jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience . \\n',\n"," b'kids today , they don\\'t just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr . loving on the ladies . \\nno , they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department : namely , playing baseball . \\nthrough a series of drippy voiceovers , we are informed that there\\'s no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues , where college also-rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention . \\nour man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a\\'s , where he is hoping for his big break . \\nit\\'s only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman\\'s thong ( don\\'t ask ) that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be : that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne , struggling to make a name for himself ; that neither his father ( fred ward ) nor brother ( jason gedrick ) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries ; and that the local beauty tenley -- tenley ! \\n ( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn\\'t even bother . . . \\nbut of course he makes a play for her . \\nsummer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy ) , the alienation felt by ryan\\'s non-baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann ) , or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas ) . \\nworst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that \\'70s show\\'s wilmer valderrama and beverly d\\'angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs . robinson-like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham . \\nin fact , virtually all of summer catch feels like it\\'s been done better somewhere else . \\nfor starters , the film has a major question of identity . \\nit\\'s definitely not a sports movie , and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance . \\nthe worst part is the amateurish script ( co-written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 ) , chock-full of phony emotion . \\nby the end , it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart . \\ndad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice . \\ncoach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he\\'s got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint . \\nryan\\'s catcher ( matthew lillard , playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to \" play catch \" with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy . \\nryan\\'s stoner best friend is on hand to give the go-get-\\'em-tiger-we\\'re-behind-you talk . \\nand the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming-nuzzly-follow-your-dreams counsel . \\nbefore long , you start to wonder : is freddy prinze jr . is capable of having a thought of his own ? \\ndon\\'t answer that . \\nthe only real joy in the film is found in biel\\'s character , and not just because of the skimpy outfits , which are also usually wet . \\nshe\\'s the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role , taking the rebelling-against-daddy character to at least a passing grade . \\nwhen she\\'s on screen , the time flies by . \\nwhen she\\'s not , you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long . \\nfor a pg-13 teen romance ( despite near-constant sexual innuendo ) , one has to ask warner brothers : what were you thinking ? ? ? \\nfor her part , biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards . \\nhollywood is either about to eat her alive . . . \\nor vice versa . \\neither way , good luck , jessica . \\nas for freddie , if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year , prinze\\'s next \" summer catch \" is liable to be a venereal disease . \\n',\n"," b\"warner brothers has scored another marketing coup . \\nthe one-two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever . \\ntrailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat , ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel . \\ncarrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11 . 99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey's return in this marketwise , but misfired comedy . \\nace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber-faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment . \\nhe may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher , in batman forever , but , here , left to his own devices , carrey quickly wears out his welcome . \\nthe opening sequence is by far the best--an amusing spoof of cliffhanger , with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon . \\n ( you can guess what happens to mr . paws . \\nhint : it sounds like splat . ) \\nthe plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas , and then to not-so-darkest africa , where ace is on the case of a missing white bat . \\nwith his hair and limbs both wildly askew , carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes . \\nthe rest of the film is just more of the same . \\nsure , the plot's linear , and the production values solid , but where is the scripted humor to support carrey's sloppy slathering ? \\nwriter and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set-ups . \\ninstead , carrey just mugs away , playing for the camera even when most of it isn't funny . \\nthe better gags have been shown in the ads , though a bit with ace emerging buck-naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see . \\nthough an arguable improvement over the original , ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten . \\nthe script is virtually devoid of wit . \\ntribal mask jokes ? \\njerry lewis cameos ? \\nforget it . \\nif anything , the inexplicable presence of simon callow ( four weddings and a funeral ) and bob gunton ( the shawshank redemption ) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor's ultimate challenge . \\njust how long * can * they keep a straight face ? \\n\",\n"," b' \" what is this , a homicide or a bad b-movie ? \" \\nthat is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie . \\nlet me clear things up for you cupcake , this isn\\'t a bad b-movie , it\\'s a really bad b-movie . \\nso bad , it\\'s almost good . \\nalmost , but not quite . \\nthe movie starts off in the 1950\\'s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth . \\nit is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies . \\nthe slugs\\' first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody . \\nthat is , until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 . \\nhe , and the slugs inside him , promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co-eds into slug zombies . \\na slightly crazed cop ( tom atkins ) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel ( jill whitlow ) join these two geeky university students ( jason lively and steve marshall ) to do battle with the slugs . \\nit more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs . \\nthe acting is bad with a capital b . the story is worse . \\nand the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie . \\nthe only saving grace was the requisite tit-shot courtesy of jill whitlow . \\nit had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it . \\nactually , it was the high point of the movie for me . \\nof course , that isn\\'t really saying much . \\nthe story moves around in a hap hazard fashion . \\nwhich gives it a leg up on some other horror films . \\nunlike most movies of this genre , there actually is a story . \\nnot a great one , but it is there . \\nthis is one in a long line of movies from the 1980\\'s that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th , halloween and nightmare on elm street movies . \\nyou could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better . \\nbut night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b-movie horror marathon . \\njust don\\'t be too upset if you can\\'t find it . \\nyou really won\\'t be missing that much . \\n',\n"," b'after the huge success of \" the exorcist \" in 1973 a sequel was inevitable , and sadly like most horror fims that make money , the filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel , that makes absolutely no sense at all , and to me was extremely pointless , wasting linda blair and max von sydow completely . \\nneedless , dumb sequel flopped in the box office , and never gained much success though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time , to which i agree with . \\nto start the \" story \" it is four years later , and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be , now a priest played by richard burton , is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan , and now the demon somehow wants to possess her again ( maybe she was good or something ) . \\nnow they must try to stop this demon from taking over regan\\'s body , before it is too late . \\nsome of the bad things exorcist ii has in it is : linda blair , she had no need to revive her character , and she is really terrible in this film , she brings it down to a lull , and in places it seems like it just stops in its place , and doesn\\'t go anywhere . \\nlouise fletcher is alright for what it\\'s worth , but she could have done a lot better than this . \\nthe direction by john boorman , is that of a confused , stylish nature that i really couldn\\'t figure out . \\nin fact , i had no idea what was going on in this film , the script was jumbled , the plot was jumbled , and the ending is just laugh out loud hilariosly bad . \\nfor those exorcist fans who haven\\'t seen this one , i recommend renting it . \\ni actually gave this one a high rating , if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins , i went easy on it however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction , but nothing else ! \\nim not saying i like the film now , so dont start going anywhere . \\nbad , bad , bad movie . \\n',\n"," b'as the twin surfer dudes , stew and phil deedle , lay bandaged and unconscious in the hospital , phil comes to first and chooses the coolest way to wake his brother . \\nyanking out his iv , he uses it like a water pistol to soak his brother\\'s face . \\nthis bit of lame physical humor is typical of disney\\'s meet the deedles , a movie more to be endured that watched . \\n ( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she\\'d start sticking her finger in her throat . \\nand she\\'s right , it is that bad . ) \\ndirected without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best . \\nboyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts . \\namazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more . \\nbut who\\'s counting ? \\nand then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic . \\nmeet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad . \\nit will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything . \\nherzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes \" your geyser\\'s a geezer , \" and \" i\\'d like to put a deedle in her haystack . \" \\nas the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as \" a walking kodak moment , \" are celebrating their 18th birthday . \\nas they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski . \\nas heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid-back beach bums into men . \\nas they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they\\'ve got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire . \\ntheir camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers . \\nthe rest of the movie has them fighting the park\\'s overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex-ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week . \\nhopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material . \\nthis isn\\'t his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he\\'s ever been in . \\nsteve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances . \\nthe only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey . \\neven the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull . \\nto add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close-ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog . \\nput a ten-foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said . \\nalthough boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie\\'s stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road . \\nthey make it look like so much fun that i\\'m sure many will try some variation of the stunt . \\n \" how could this possibly be worst , \" asks phil . \\njust when you suspect it can\\'t , the movie takes a turn further downhill . \\nits low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag . \\nafter phil\\'s girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil , they suck in a long worm . \\nlike the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp , their lips finally meet in a kiss . \\nas they pull back , their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested . \\nmeet the deedles runs about an hour and a half . \\nit is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up . \\nmy son jeffrey and his friend nickolas , both almost 9 , gave the show * * * . \\nthey both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites . \\nnickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep , and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo . \\n',\n"," b'so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? \\nwell , whatever it is , you\\'d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we\\'re left with here . \\nthis is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! \\nit\\'s like i said . . . this \\nmovie sucks . \\nplot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . \\ncritique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . \\nuneven , would be another . \\nthe trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so-so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it\\'s actually going to go \" somewhere \" . \\nbut it isn\\'t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the \" pain \" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . \\nin a sci-fi movie ? \\nwell , i don\\'t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . \\nultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their \" misadventures in space \" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings this side of contact . \\nmind you , if you enjoyed that film\\'s shrug-of-the-shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . \\nof course , i don\\'t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . \\nugh . \\nwhat a friggin\\' mess . \\nfilms like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . \\ndidn\\'t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? \\ndidn\\'t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain\\'t saying much ! ) . \\nof course , you can\\'t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o\\'connell in this fine crew of thespians . \\n\\'nuff said . \\nneither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film\\'s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my \\nears hurt ! ) . \\nso is anything salvageable in this movie ? \\nsure . \\ngary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn\\'t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the \" sand-twister \" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . \\nother than that ? \\ni guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , \\ndid i say \" admire \" , i meant \" am disgusted \" ! \\nall in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it\\'s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . \\ngo see the ninth gate . . . now \\nthere\\'s a great movie ! \\nand on a personal note , i think it\\'s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting . \\n',\n"," b'originally launched in 1978 , this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers . \\nbased on the mighty successful musical from broadway , grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6 . 5/10 ) , \\nstarring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles . \\nplot : high-school musical set in the 1950\\'s showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia . \\nthe film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song , dance and humour . \\ncritique : fun-loving , energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler . \\nthis movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950\\'s , with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers . \\nadmittedly , i am somewhat biased in this opinion , since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoe\\'s first big-screen experiences , and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection ) , and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time . \\nbut apart from the nostalgic vibe , i was still extremely impressed by this film , as it continued to amuse me , despite my previous dozen or so viewings . \\nthis film took john travolta from a dim-witted \" sweathog \" on tv\\'s welcome back kotter , and transformed him into a movie-star of spectacular proportions ( saturday night fever ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity ) . \\nunfortunately for the rest of the cast , his popularity was not terribly contagious , despite their effective showings in this classic movie . \\non the down side , some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off ( like when sandy sings about \" drinking lemonade \" and \" staying out until 10 \" with danny in \" summer nights \" ) , and the plot isn\\'t exactly the most elaborate story-line ever created , but despite these small reservations , this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time ( and believe me . . . i \\nam not a fan of the musicals ! ! ) . \\nmake sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player , as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film\\'s absolute highlights . \\nand don\\'t forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards , so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you\\'re feeling a little blue . \\nlittle known facts : henry winkler , of tv\\'s happy days\\' fonzie fame , turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career . \\nboth travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture . \\nconaway eventually bowed out of the woo-fest , and married newton-john\\'s sister a year later ( divorced after five years ) . \\n',\n"," b'review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 ) \\ncast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole\\' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch \\nrating : good shot ( stars ) \\nlanguid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman . \\njuxtaposing the samurai\\'s honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor\\'s precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era . \\ndirector jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit . \\nusing a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film . \\nhe doesn\\'t cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies . \\nthe action is presented in flat , brutal codas . \\nbullets have permanence . \\ndeath has consequences . \\nthe movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty . \\nit is an anti-movie , of sorts . \\nthere are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with . \\nthis isn\\'t a film that lovingly holds your hand . \\nthere are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see . \\nthe fulcrum for the movie\\'s thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman . \\na twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms . \\nunlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing . \\nhe wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance . \\nthere are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal . \\nhe uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion . \\nghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai . \\nlife consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books . \\nghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead . \\nliving atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends . \\nhe craves nothing more . \\nas he puts it late in the film , \" i\\'ve seen all i want to see . \" \\nhe exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings . \\nghost dog wasn\\'t always as he is presented . \\nin several roshomon-like flashbacks , it\\'s shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that \" samaritan \" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family . \\nghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment . \\nafter years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill \" handsome frank \" , a made man within louie\\'s organization who has run away with the crime boss\\'s daughter , louise ( vessey ) . \\nghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon . \\nin a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog . \\nupset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade . \\nthe rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict . \\nthe theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog\\'s world . \\neach time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it\\'s from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by . \\nnear the end , louise is watching a cartoon that\\'s a departure from the previously shown ones . \\nit\\'s a bit of audacity on jarmusch\\'s part that is nicely effective , despite it\\'s surrealistic nature . \\nas ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people . \\none is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading . \\nshe comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does . \\nby film\\'s end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer . \\nthe other person in ghost dog\\'s world is an ice cream ( de bankole\\' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog . \\nthe vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land . \\njarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie . \\nghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars . \\n ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about

\\nthe film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before . \\nbut what the cast and crew don\\'t know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again . \\non one level , \" return to horror high \" is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on . \\nwatching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn\\'t help but take notice that the killer\\'s costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , \" scream , \" and \" scream 2 . \" \\non another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout . \\nunfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat . \\nand the last thing the film wants to be is a \" behind-the-scenes \" look at an exploitation film being made . \\nthe only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be . \\nand to top it all off , the \" twist \" ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever , and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time . \\nthere are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through . \\nif you see the film , or have seen it , you\\'ll know what i mean . \\nthe premise of \" return to horror high , \" is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place . \\nbut director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene . \\nwell , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in . \\nbut other than that two-minute distraction , \" return to horror high , \" is certainly no great shake . \\nnote : look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film . \\nand strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . . literally . \\n',\n"," b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\njames toback\\'s return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake\\'s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue . \\nembracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters . \\nfortunately , the film\\'s cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing . \\nthe film\\'s setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly . \\nwe meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft . \\nas they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they\\'re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn\\'t take long for them to come to the realisation that they\\'re being two-timed by the same guy . \\nmore indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake\\'s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation . \\nit\\'s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride . \\nplayed with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights . \\nit\\'s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film\\'s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour . \\nwhether he\\'s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it\\'s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful . \\nthough at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly . \\n ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla\\'s unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat\\'s out of the bag . ) \\ndouble-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs . \\nsurprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film . \\nhowever , it\\'d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou\\'s outrage to full feature-length , and it\\'s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel . \\nthe dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film\\'s tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat . \\nsubtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale . \\none key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla . \\ntwo girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film\\'s thematic narrative is rather dubious . \\nif anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film . \\nhe plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered . \\nit\\'s a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it\\'s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake\\'s self-chiding to \" get [his] shit together \" is disquieting in its resonance . \\nwhile mr . downey jr . \\'s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles . \\nms . graham is quickly becoming one of america\\'s more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman . \\nshe\\'s quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry . \\nmeanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing . \\nshe tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox . \\nthe film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout . \\ntwo girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors . \\nwhile the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn\\'t feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner . \\ntwo girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it\\'s still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends . \\n \" i\\'m an actor , \" he tells them at one point , using the ol\\' tried-and-tested occupational-hazard defense . \\n \" actors lie . \" \\nbut not , they all seem to agree , denzel washington . \\n',\n"," b\"movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office . \\nbut when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well . \\nwith a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . \\nit got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' . \\nand , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video . \\nin the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity . \\nthe mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation . \\nmk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition . \\ndespite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth . \\noutworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel . \\nearth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces . \\nit's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie . \\nit is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story . \\nthis becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more . \\nthey are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act . \\nthis becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana . \\nthe original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best . \\nthey spoke little , but fought a lot . \\nthus , the movie was easy to digest . \\nhowever , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably . \\nthis uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak . \\nnot only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g . \\nuseless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom . \\ntry reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean . \\nbut the movie is not a complete fatality . \\nfight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility . \\nand players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo . \\neven if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves . \\nbut it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect . \\noddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence . \\nand the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival . \\n ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) . \\nrent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . \\n\",\n"," b\"the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . \\nthis slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . \\nwhen the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . \\nupon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . \\nas the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . \\ndid dolores kill her husband ? \\nand did she kill her employer ? \\ndolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . \\nconsequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . \\nkathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . \\ndolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . \\nshe dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . \\nkathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . \\nthe rest of the cast is also very good . \\njennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . \\ndavid strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . \\njudy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . \\nchild actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . \\nthe direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . \\nthe segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . \\nthe pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . \\nhowever , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . \\nit would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . \\nnone of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . \\nalthough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . \\ndolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . \\nhowever , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . \\non my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . \\n\",\n"," b'let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series . \\nit is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof . \\nan omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it\\'s difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title . \\na song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse . \\nthe plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore\\'s 007 . \\nthere is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency . \\nit\\'s as much of a mess as it sounds . \\nbond is \" helped \" in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn\\'t possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo . \\nduring the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever . \\nmaud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie . \\nscaramanga\\'s lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures . \\nworse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie . \\nthere is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) . \\nthe solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the \" action \" is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w . \\npepper , played by clifton james of live and let die \" fame \" ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window . \\nhe is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie . \\neven his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print . \\non top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga\\'s \" funhouse \" . \\nthe only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior \" the spy who loved me \" ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive . \\n',\n"," b'battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close . \\nin fact , i\\'ll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years . \\nbased on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information . \\nit\\'s the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes . \\nok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind . \\nwhen were we conquered ? \\nthe audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we\\'re going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . . \\nkeep reading ) . \\nalso , why don\\'t we get to see earth get conquered ? \\nhow the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? \\nhumans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film\\'s first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado . \\nthey grunt and groan and babble about monsters . \\nso , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? \\nnone of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . \\nthis is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film . \\none of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it . \\nthe \" monster \" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . \\nhe turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them . \\nso , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? \\nanyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit . \\nthe cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something . \\nso these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? \\nand , we\\'re supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can\\'t even handle a few cavemen ? \\none of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . \\nso jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? \\nplease , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood . \\nwhy did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? \\nshouldn\\'t they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? \\nthe psychlos refer to humans as \" man animals \" but yet dogs are still \" dogs \" . \\nwhy aren\\'t they \" dog animals \" ? \\nthe psychlos are after mining earth\\'s precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? \\nwhy do i even care at this point ? \\ni\\'m a fan of travolta\\'s and i\\'m glad to see he\\'s back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) . \\nbut how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? \\nand how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? \\nhe\\'s more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn\\'t hold back my laughter . \\nnow despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta . \\nall of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee . \\nalso , travolta\\'s acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world . \\nooooo , scary villain . \\nas a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better . \\nyou can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth . \\ni did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . . \\ni cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . . \\nand still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids . \\nby the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film . \\nfolks , save your cash . . \\ndon\\'t go see it , don\\'t rent it , and don\\'t buy it . \\nyou\\'d be more entertained by taking the money you\\'d use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . . \\nwe\\'ll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) . \\nunless of course you\\'re just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you\\'ll come away with from this movie . \\nthat , and a headache . \\n[editor\\'s note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology . \\ni\\'m not sure why . . . \\nsomething just made me feel compelled make the choice . ] \\n',\n"," b\"the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence . \\nit's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it doesn't make a shred of sense . \\nand whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? \\njames foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor . \\nbut the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train . \\nat least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role . \\nchow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop . \\nhe's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he's very familiar with chinatown . \\nthat's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) . \\nnick and danny begin by stepping on each other's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one's life . \\nwhat happens after that is kind of a mystery to me . \\ni'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) . \\ni'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff . \\ni'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way . \\nthere's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn't have much to do with the main story . \\none of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn't make any sense . \\ni don't blame this entirely on foley , because he's obviously a good director . \\ni'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci's script , which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act . \\none scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he's angry about his new white partner . \\nhe's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me . \\n ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all . ) \\nthere are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent . \\nthere's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents . \\nthe plot itself never straightens out . \\ni'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group . \\nthe corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences . \\nthe sequences aren't bad , but they're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ? \\non that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ? \\none too many , i'd imagine . \\nfoley's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here . \\nthe scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together . \\nchow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . \\nwahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he's still fun to watch . \\ni also liked the subplot involving danny's father ; brian cox's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . \\nbut the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes . \\na complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it's over . \\nthe corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there's nothing left to hold on to . \\n\",\n"," b'call \" hush \" \" stop or my mom will kill . \" \\nor \" mommy fearest . \" \\nor \" the hand that robs the cradle . \" \\ncall it whatever you want , but certainly don\\'t see it unless you\\'re in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- \" hush \" scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure . \\nchalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) , the latter of which appears to have given \" hush \" a send-off that\\'s downright infuriating . \\nit\\'s too bad that \" hush \" is so laughable , because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at . \\npaltrow and johnathon

delves into martha\\'s dark side , predictable cliches -- chain-smoking , staring in mirrors , praying in a confessional to a priest who isn\\'t there , poking a hole in helen\\'s diaphragm so she\\'ll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound , but it\\'s moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch . \\nveteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson\\'s wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother . \\nthe rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable , especially paltrow . \\nbut can you really blame them ? \\nthe character relationships in \" hush \" hold a certain amount of promise , at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity . \\nidiotic situations ( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment idiotic dialogue ( \" why did you yell ? \" \\nhelen yells back at martha ) , and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made . \\nyou can see through a great deal of martha\\'s actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ? \\ndoes nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ? \\nif any of her potential victims thought , acted or behaved like normal people , \" hush \" would be a really short movie . \\nand then there\\'s the climax and ending , which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing drug normally used on horses . \\nafter a really weird chase scene , martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself . \\ni won\\'t spoil what happens next except to say that it\\'s contradictory , illogical and ( probably , since i\\'m no doctor ) medically impossible . \\nthe final scene offers no closure , no resolution , no confrontation whatsoever . \\nit\\'s just there , dangling amidst silent displeasure . \\nno one should like this ending , regardless of their feelings on the preceding material . \\nperhaps \" hush \" \\'s title is a plea to silence its audience\\'s likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater . \\n',\n"," b'mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . \\nas you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . \\nit may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . \\nin fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . \\ntoward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . \\nthe film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . \\nsomething else is what he did . \\nthe film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . \\nshe crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . \\nmeanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . \\nshe wants to build a career as an actress . \\nbetty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . \\nshe does not know who the woman is . \\nshe is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . \\nthey fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . \\nmeanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . \\nhe is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . \\nthese two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . \\nthere is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . \\nin what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . \\na lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . \\nlynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . \\nhe just chooses not to . \\nas with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . \\nthere are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . \\nthe film is a little long for the subject matter . \\ntoward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . \\nunfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . \\ni will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\nmulholland drive spoiler warning . \\ni have rated this film fairly low . \\nyou should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . \\ndavid lynch is in large part a dark satirist . \\nmost of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . \\nin mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . \\nwhat he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) \\nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . \\nthe first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . \\nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . \\nthe audience expectation is that they will add up . \\nbut he has given clues that are self-contradictory . \\nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . \\nin fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . \\nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . \\nmad magazine called it a poiuyt . \\nother sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . \\nlook at small portions of it and makes sense . \\nlook at the whole figure and it does not . \\nthis film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \\n',\n"," b'okay , i just don\\'t know why , but i seem to be getting this diversion to disney-made real-life actors movies . . . as \\nwell as real-life acting tim allen movies . \\ni couldn\\'t even make it through \" the santa clause , \" so why did i even see this ? \\n ( just to make an idle point , i did like \" toy story , \" but that was good ) also , i have this aversion to bad french farces , and if they remake them into american films . \\nwell , this is my excuse : it was prom night , i\\'m not a prom person , my best friend and i impulsively went to the drive-ins where they were playing \" grosse pointe blank \" - wouldn\\'t mind seeing it again - but i had to suffer through this first . \\ni agreed to go . \\nugh . \\nin all fairness , i can say that at least this inane plot wasn\\'t dreamed by an american . \\nit was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of \" little indian , big city \" ( french title - \" un indien dans la ville \" ) . \\ni stayed away from it like it was limburgher , and according to roger ebert , that was a good idea . \\nbut i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement . \\nthe stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage . \\nlet me clarify : his wife ( jobeth williams ) left him years ago , and i mean years - around 13 or so - and went to an island in the carribean or something . \\nhe goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this . . . thing \\n ( played with an emphasis on over-done by lolita davidovitch , who is usually good ) . \\nshe tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off . \\nhe meets him , he has a weird name ( mimi seku , i think . . . or \\nas the bad joke goes - \" mitsubishi \" - laugh track cue ) , he knows english , they fish , more bad jokes , pirhanna joke , the kid has a pet spider , he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty . . . you \\nknow the drill . \\nnow this is where the plot complicates ( well , complicates for this one , at least ) : the fish-out-of-water joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city . \\ntim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasn\\'t able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is - martin short . \\na russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere ( how come in every hokey french import , there is a mob ? ! ) \\ntim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries . \\nthe story is crap , the jokes are hokey and not really funny , and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting . \\nbut the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn\\'t help it . \\nthe whole time , i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this . \\nat the end of filming , did they all scream out , \" we\\'ve made a great movie , guys ! \" \\ni sure hope not . \\nbig question to get from this film : why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if they\\'re just going to do it the exact same way ? \\nhuh ? \\nmy ( for some of the actors\\' names and a joke or two that made me chuckle , i guess . . . okay , \\nso i really feel bad for it , so i only gave it one star ) \\n',\n"," b'steven spielberg\\'s second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film . \\nspielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries . \\nhe also managed to cast this era\\'s greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle . \\nfor about 160 out of its 170 minutes , \" saving private ryan \" is flawless . \\nliterally . \\nthe plot is simple enough . \\nafter the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt . john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt . \\njames ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle . \\nonce they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home . \\naccompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational . \\nbarry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home . \\nthe battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary . \\nliterally . \\nthere is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film\\'s first 20 minutes . \\nspielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection . \\nthe sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan . \\nthere are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences . \\nthis is what coppola was looking for in \" apocalypse now \" , but couldn\\'t create . \\nthe sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war . \\nthe performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary . \\nhe is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears . \\nhanks is this country\\'s finest actor , and he proves it here . \\nhowever , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece . \\nwith a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film . \\nthe sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs . ryan is decent , but doesn\\'t hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it . \\nbut that is forgivable . \\nwhat isn\\'t is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences . \\nthe first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men . \\nthe last sequence is atrocious . \\nthe forced emotion , accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music , is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film . \\nthese flaws are what downgrade \" ryan \" from the greatest film of our era , to the greatest war film of our era . \\nspielberg should have trusted his own material , and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie , to end his masterpiece right there . \\nthe use of the flag , though patriotic , is in contrast to the movie\\'s theme . \\nthe power of the bulk of the film , however , is astonishing . \\nspielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art , that persists even after first viewing of the film , is extraordinary . \\nthis is the film of the year . \\n',\n"," b\"here's a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie . \\nnow if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don't know what is . \\nall sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude . \\nvan damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives . \\nvan damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france . \\nthe remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death . \\nonce there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are . \\njean-claude's acting abilities don't seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie . \\nin other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal . \\non the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked . \\nsadly , this is probably the high point in the movie . \\nshe is actually a decent actress , but didn't improve as much as i thought she would after species . \\nthis is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents . \\nnothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other van damme movie . \\nsimply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie . \\nit has a retread plot -- this isn't the first time jean-claude has played twins . \\nhe still can't act . \\nwe all saw natasha's breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i'm not complaining about ) . \\nthis is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par . \\n\",\n"," b' \" the 13th warrior \" comes at the end of as summer where we\\'ve already experienced man eating sharks ( \" deep blue sea \" ) , man eating crocodiles ( \" lake placid \" ) and even a man hunting witch ( \" the blair witch project \" ) . \\nnow , \" the 13th warrior \" presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears . \\nthe story , if that\\'s what you want to call it , follows ahmed ibn fahdlan ( antonio banderas ) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king\\'s wife and is banished from his home land . \\nhe then travels to the land of the vikings and becomes an ambassador to them . \\neventually the vikings are called upon to protect the people of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men . \\nthirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission , and as you guessed it , ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth . \\nhe\\'s not a warrior , and at first not well accepted by the vikings , but as the movie advances he\\'ll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield . \\nthat\\'s basically the entire plot . \\nthere is also a romantic subplot that has been so badly mishandled and , one assumes , drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn\\'t just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part of the story . \\ninstead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer . \\nthe film is basically non- stop action and when it pauses and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock . \\nthe battle scenes , although well choreographed , are not involving and not the least bit exciting . \\nwe don\\'t get to know any of the characters and so we don\\'t care who lives and who dies . \\nthe film , which wants to be beowolf , comes across more as a failed action-adventure story aspiring to epic proportions but not achieving it on any levels . \\nit was directed by john mctiernan who\\'s , \" the thomas crown affair \" is also playing in theaters currently . \\nand it\\'s not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films but that , \" the 13th warrior \" was placed on the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences . \\nit belongs back on the shelf . \\n',\n"," b'probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism . \\neveryone knows about the greatest and most famous shipping disaster of all time . \\nand the actual catastrophe is masterfully crafted by director james cameron , combining visual -and sound effects , he re-creates the frightening atmosphere of the sinking ship in the middle of nowhere . \\ni liked very much the emotional and brutal contrast between the first and the third classes . \\nwhile their cabin is slowly filling up with water , a mother is telling her children a fairytail -- \" . . and \\nthey lived happily ever after . . \" . \\nand then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air . \\nhowever , the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie , while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues . \\nin the present day , the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton ) , a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond , lost during the sinking . \\nsomewhere inside the ship , lovett\\'s crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead . \\nhere , in the shape of a nude young lady , is a window into the distant age of 1912 . \\nlovett is extremely surprised when he get\\'s a phone call from rose dawson , claiming that she is a model . \\nshe is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel , and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years . \\nas the memories come flooding back , she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet ) , the fianc ? e of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher ) . \\non board there are rich and poor , everyone trust in the ship\\'s designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master , captain e . j . \\nsmith ( bernard hill ) . \\non board the ship , rose , unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist , poor , brave and attractive . \\na love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes , but also face the greatest power on earth - death . \\ncameron could as well have called his picture \" the never ending love \" or \" love at first sight \" , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself . \\nthe plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera . \\nthe director doesn\\'t even try to overcome his empty script . \\nbecause of its primitive and predictable plot , titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking . \\nrussel carpenter\\'s rich , majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy . \\neverything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch . \\nbut it doesn\\'t help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them . \\nthe actors are not to blame , because their characters are more like caricatures , in other words - fake . \\njack is a man with many talents : he is a talented artist , handsome , brave , honest , strong , funny . . . you \\nname it . \\nhe doesn\\'t have any dark side , he doesn\\'t make any mistakes , that for a second would make him human . \\njack is perfect , but he is - poor . \\non the other hand we have cal . \\nhe is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be . \\nhe lacks everything jack possesses , but he is -- rich . \\nthis childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture . \\ncameron knows precisely what we want to see . \\nhis film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience - attractive actors , a \" tragic love story \" , beautiful visuals ( including expensive special effects ) , a dose of social criticism , a fascinating historical event ( we love true stories ) and last , but not least - an incredible media support , which proclaimed an average picture the \" greatest film of all time \" . \\non the outside titanic looks perfect , but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals - is emptiness - nothing to think about . \\nthe main weakness of this film , which ironically became its success , is simplicity . \\ncameron enables our basic and if you wish - primitive emotions : love , hate , fear and helplessness . \\neveryone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable - a sinking ship . \\ntitanic is a typical hollywood production , totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot . \\nit\\'s a good picture , but absolutely not a masterpiece . \\nit\\'s among hundreds and thousands good films released every year , not better or worse than the average american film . \\n',\n"," b'in present day hanoi , three sisters reflect on

\" is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it . \\nstrangely enough , on the same

1989\\'s \" leviathan , \" 1989\\'s \" deep star six , \" and all four \" alien \" pictures . \\n \" virus , \" in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn\\'t include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on . \\nbased on a series of comic books , \" virus \" concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon . \\nafter discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen . \\nonce the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted .

santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out . \\nif \" virus \" sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you\\'re correct . \\nalthough the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn\\'t appear to have a brain in its head . \\nthe film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the \" creature \" genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film . \\nthe actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play . \\nin her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it . \\nalthough 1998\\'s \" halloween : h20 \" was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here . \\ndonald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994\\'s \" the puppet masters , \" although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic \" invasion of the body snatchers , \" where he was fabulous . \\nthe last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do . \\nbasically , \" virus \" is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one . \\nit is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ? \\nas long as

west\\'s bright spots , such as the cool opening credits sequence , bai ling\\'s all-too-brief appearance as a femme fatale , or the brilliant \" his master\\'s voice \" joke , are all part of the film\\'s first half , which is more clever and enjoyable , at least , than its second . \\nwhen , towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west , gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it , there was a collective groan among audience members : it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider , the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz-bang finale . \\n',\n"," b'adam sandler isn\\'t known for appearing in deep , thought-provoking films , but he\\'s still a really funny guy . \\nmost of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them , but because they let sandler do what he does best without a stupid plot to drown him out . \\nbig daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important than sandler\\'s comic performance , and it\\'s a miserable failure . \\nsandler plays a thirty-something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy ( played by cole and dylan sprouse ) . \\nas one might expect from the synopsis , director dennis dugan resorts to the usual bag of manipulative and sentimental sequences , including a repulsive courtroom battle and a lot of teary scenes in which characters say \" good-bye \" to one another ; in addition , there\\'s a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor ( urine and vomit both get more screen time than sandler himself ) . \\nthere\\'s a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters , and the film features passable performances from sandler , joey lauren adams ( as the love interest ) , and the two young boys , but the film on the whole is trite and disappointingly unfunny . \\n',\n"," b'those print and television ads trumpeting that \" \\'grease\\' is still the word \" are right on the money . \\nto celebrate its 20th anniversary , this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like \" star wars \" -- a well-deserved , red-carpet rerelease . \\nthat\\'s fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ? \\nor the hard-nosed principal ( eve arden ) reminding the student body to \" be an athletic supporter \" by rooting for the home team ? \\nor national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- \" empty nest \" dinah manhoff ) ? \\nand these are all probably considered minor moments . . . \\na very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton-john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson , and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom\\'s most effervescently charming . \\nfor those eight of you who aren\\'t familiar with the story , here\\'s a brief recap : greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer ; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started , but both were wrong . \\nsandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny\\'s too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t-bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) . \\nso sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back . \\nthe drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of \" greased lightening , \" the film\\'s big \" guy \" number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but \" grease \" \\'s flaws amount too few to carp . \\nthe movie\\'s first showpiece is \" summer nights , \" where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun romance . \\nnot only is \" nights \" tremendously catchy , but it\\'s also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes . \\nthere has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two punch of \" you\\'re the one that i want \" and \" we go together , \" \" grease \" \\'s euphoric cappers . \\nall this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar-nominated \" hopelessly devoted to you \" is a lovely showcase for newton-john , and channing\\'s lamenting ballad \" there are worse things i could do \" is one of \" grease \" \\'s most unjustly overlooked tunes . \\nthe soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of \" nights \" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos . \\nand it\\'s a testament to \" grease \" \\'s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it\\'s the same all-around blast it\\'s always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music . \\nto \\'90s viewers , \" grease \" will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo-wop and poodle skirts . \\nbut regardless of what decade it transports us to , we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt , \" grease \" is still the word . \\n',\n"," b'ripe with explosions , mass death and really weird hairdos , tsui hark\\'s \" double team \" must be the result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that decided jean-claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie-bedpost and nba superstar dennis rodman should have an acting career . \\nactually , in \" double team , \" neither\\'s performance is all that bad . \\ni\\'ve always been the one critic to defend van damme -- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars ( namely steven seagal ) never aim for ; it\\'s just that he\\'s never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994\\'s \" timecop . \" \\nand rodman . . . \\nwell , he\\'s pretty much rodman . \\nhe\\'s extremely colorful , and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t , even if the role is that of an ex-cia weapons expert . \\nit\\'s the story that needs some major work . \\nvan damme plays counter-terrorist operative jack quinn , who teams up with arms dealer yaz ( rodman ) to rub out deadly gangster stavros ( mickey rourke , all beefy and weird-looking ) in an antwerp amusement park . the job is botched when stavros\\' son gets killed in the gunfire , and quinn is taken off to an island known as \" the colony \" -- a think tank for soldiers \" too valuable to kill \" but \" too dangerous to set free . \" \\nquinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife ( natacha lindinger ) , but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her . \\nso , what\\'s a kickboxing mercenary to do ? \\nquinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman , kill stavros , save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do . \\nwith crazy , often eye-popping camera work by peter pau and rodman\\'s lite brite locks , \" double team \" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure . \\nbut too much tries to happen in each frame , and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated . \\nthe numerous action scenes are loud and headache-inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what\\'s going on in the movie . \\nand much of what\\'s going on is just wacky . \\nthere\\'s a whole segment devoted to net-surfing monks that i have yet to figure out . \\nand the climax finds quinn going head-to-head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle , trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn\\'s baby boy ( who\\'s in a bomb equipped basket ) -- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers . \\ndid i mention \" double team \" is strange ? \\nwhen it all comes down , this is just another rarely entertaining formula killathon , albeit one that feels no need to indulge in gratuitous profanity . \\nrodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona , though , leading up to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs . \\nbut we didn\\'t need \" double team \" to tell us he could do that , did we ? \\n',\n"," b'surrounded by hype , high hopes , and the promise of an over-the-top performance by clueless\\'s brittany murphy , don\\'t say a word looked full of promise . \\nhell , when i hear that

hard-nosed detective sandra cassidy ( jennifer esposito , doing her best j . lo impression ) tracking down koster and his gang of hoodlums , the stakes are raised as nathan races against the clock to crack the mystery of elisabeth\\'s head in order to get the goods inside . \\nthe catch - nathan only has until five o\\'clock to solve the puzzle ! \\nwhoa , the suspense is almost too much . \\ndon\\'t say a word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes . \\nmurphy looks and acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of the movie , then turns around and reprises like her role from girl , interrupted . \\nand the only real \" crazy \" to be found in the film is director gary fleder\\'s ( things to do in denver when you\\'re dead ) staggering use of flashback sequences . \\noliver platt , famke janssen , and even sean bean are decent actors , but the stuff they are given here -- such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her crutch -- is insulting and demeaning . \\nadditionally , the use of the surveillance cameras and laptops to track nathan\\'s every move is downright unbelievable . \\nhow do ex-cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment ? \\ndespite its flaws , don\\'t say a word is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film you\\'ll find this month -- and audiences will lap it up . \\namericans love lukewarm , half-baked thrillers starring big names and accompanied by cheap thrills . \\nsomeone get me my lithium ! \\n',\n"," b\"i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . \\ntake the professional , for example . \\nit boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . \\nit's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . \\nthe professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . \\nthe professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . \\none day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . \\nher name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . \\nagent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off . \\nleon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . \\nthe two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . \\nwriter/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . \\nthere is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . \\nbut beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . \\nthe relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . \\nleon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . \\njean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . \\nnatalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . \\nbesson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . \\na silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . \\ngary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . \\nthere isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . \\na more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . \\nthere were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . \\nbut besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . \\nthis is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . \\na great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . \\n\",\n"," b\"apparantly money talks . \\n . \\n . \\nand uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so ! \\ni've always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess , whether in language , violence , sex , or what have you . \\ni find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard , and money talks definitely does ! \\nit's not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly ( and i mean constantly ! ) , but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged . \\nperhaps if one character were foul mouthed , but in this film , everybody swears nearly every other word . \\nmoney talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett ( played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker ) . \\nfranklin is your typical con-man and ends up with more than one person out to get him . \\nwhen the plot finally gets underway , there's no less than three people ( or groups ) that want him , dead or alive . \\nthe frenchman who's somewhat responsible for franklin's escape from a prisoner-packed bus , a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand , and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder . \\nfranklin's only hope : james russell ( charlie sheen ) , an investigative reporter for the local news who's out to prove himself a worthy journalist . \\njames offers to help clear franklin's name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week . \\nboth of these elements are completely lost along the way however , and never do reappear . \\nas expected , the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end , which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way . \\nthere is just nothing original or intriguing about this film , and so many developments are either non-relevant , or just plain forgotten about . \\nmoney talks is a paint-by-numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience . \\nfrivilous dialogue , a predictable , flat storyline , and two-dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your

day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ? \\nin dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem . \\ndark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery . \\npoor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner . \\na mysterious

inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) . \\nis john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ? \\nhe searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues . \\nbut when the clues don\\'t fit , it doesn\\'t just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city . \\nto john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city . \\nhow come it\\'s always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ? \\nand how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ? \\nevery night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the \\'strangers\\' come out and do

reality-warping abilities as the strangers . \\neven with the help of scientist dr . daniel schreber , can john take back the dark city ? \\nopinion : director alex proyas ( he also directed the crow ) mentions this in the dark city press kit : in films , science fiction is always \" used to have big spaceships blow up cities . \\ni think we\\'re a little tired of that . \" \\naccording to director proyas , probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers . \\nit\\'s designed so that you can watch the film over again , and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch . \\nit\\'s a philosophical piece . \\ncinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons , giant bugs , or proponents of the dark side of the force ) . \\nbut science fiction in books reaches beyond the \\'shoot-em-up\\' level and targets the big questions , questions like who are we ? \\nwhat is the human condition ? \\nwhat is ethical ? \\nwhat would a true human being do ? \\nfar from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtles , dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens , but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner . \\ndark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay . \\na little more than 200 years ago , the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian , military , conformist , medieval regimes . \\nthe people took refuge in religion , the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering , but after death , heaven would be available . \\nmeanwhile , the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes ; the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven . \\nwhen science finally overturned religion , the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments . \\nbut the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old . \\nthis is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud , kant , kafka , nietzsche , and dostoevsky pondered what society should be , and what place the individual had in it . \\nthe existentialists\\' in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile , indifferent , or alienated universe . \\nin dark city , when

condition isn\\'t located in here . \" \\n',\n"," b\"synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage . \\n ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . ) \\nin the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china . \\na girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle . \\nmulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father . \\nten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph . \\nthe emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes . \\nmulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman . \\nthe disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) . \\nin disney's mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army . \\nold mr . fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen ) . \\nfearing for her father's life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father's stead . \\nmeanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner . \\n ( his only duty is to ring a gong . ) \\nmushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero . \\nwith the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? \\nopinion : east meets west . \\ni know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors . \\nfrom their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan . \\ni mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? \\nyet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic . \\nthe end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever . \\npersonally , i'm also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative . \\nmulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney . \\nkids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing . \\nand adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles . \\nand adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning . \\nbut even the tiniest details reveal quality . \\nthe movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place . \\ncomputers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called 'attila' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback . \\nand singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game . \\nbalance is crucial . \\na movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney's cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow ! \\nthe dream team . \\nby the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp . \\nit's rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye . \\nit's movie for any age , creed , gender , or color . \\n\",\n"," b'it\\'s amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand-up around but completely fall flat in the movies . \\ntake adam sandler . \\non the basis of his first two cds ( \" they\\'re all gonna laugh at you ! \" \\nand \" what the hell happened to me ? \" ) , \\nhe\\'s the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams . \\nbut when you put him in front of a camera , it just isn\\'t the same . \\ni kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation , but his latest film , the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal . \\nseriously , i\\'m willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here . \\nin fact , i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic . \\nthe first half hour generated not one smile in me , with it\\'s scenes of emotional abuse towards adam\\'s character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players , but also by his very disturbed mother ( kathy bates - what is the world coming to ? ) . \\ngranted , after the film gets rolling , there are a few mild chuckles throughout ( i\\'m even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice ) , but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it\\'s nearly hour and a half running time . \\nyou\\'re all familiar with the plot because you\\'ve seen it at least a million times before ; everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions , in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves . \\nand believe me , i\\'m not giving anything away by saying that sandler\\'s team wins . \\nif you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie , then god be with you . \\nthe only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby\\'s love interest . \\ni mean , they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose , but they do extremely well with what they are given here . \\nkudos to both of them . \\nmy advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin , who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen . \\nrely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh . \\nor maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have , like jim carrey did with the recent truman show . \\nwith the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses , he just can\\'t keep going on like this . \\n',\n"," b\"cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ? \\nit's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . \\nrecently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others . \\n ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ? \\nthey are likely to be remembered for . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , quite a while . ? \\ni like this film , too . ? \\nyes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ? \\ntrue , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ? \\nand there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ? \\nin fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable . \\ni certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through . \\nof course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . \\nthe story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters . \\nyes , you read that right . \\narmageddon actually has characters you can care about ! \\nif you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . \\nif you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . \\nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . \\nso , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it . \\n ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) \\ntheir plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . \\nthe head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . \\nhis group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j . \\n ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . \\nthere's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter . \\na . j . \\nand grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation . \\nit's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon . \\nit's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff . \\nit's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens . \\nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . \\ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . \\ntake the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . \\na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . \\nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . \\ni like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch . \\nit's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . \\nbut it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . \\nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . \\ndeep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . \\nspecial effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work . \\neverything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . \\nthe effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . \\nof course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . \\nthe film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . \\nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots . \\ni won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . \\nin fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . \\nbruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . \\ntyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . \\npatton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . \\nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . \\ni wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much . \\nbut the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . \\nit's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema . \\nit might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . \\ni'm not saying that films like this are risky moves . \\nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms . \\n\",\n"," b' \"

the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie\\'s brutally squandered potential , the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards . \\nthe big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind \" the crying game . \" \\nhe\\'s no stranger to cinematic weirdness , but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope . \\nthings start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji\\'s stunning camera work guiding viewers into the

entire film - there\\'s even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn - but if there ever was a film that didn\\'t deserve so good a polish , it\\'s this one . \\ndon\\'t knock the look , but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue . \\nannette bening , another asset \" in dreams \"

bening\\'s acting that she delves equally into claire\\'s madness and compassion . \\nbut as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , \" in

here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward . \\ncredit to them , but we aren\\'t really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters . \\nwhere ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves\\' character is never

convention , new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screen update of the cult 1960s sci-fi tv show lost in space , complete with in-person appearances by cast members mimi rogers , matt leblanc , lacey chabert , jack johnson , and even gary oldman . \\nthat should have set off my warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago , when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle . . . \\nlast action hero . \\nbut no , like millions of others , i bought into the hype and \" got lost . \" \\nif only i had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe . \\nyou may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film . \\nat the convention , goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series , and if that really is the case , i\\'d hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in . \\nto say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not . \\nafter the setup , in which the robinson family--father john ( william hurt , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews ) , mother maureen ( rogers , wasted ) , daughters judy ( heather graham , ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made-up chabert , looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things ) , and son will ( young newcomer johnson , making the best of it ) --and pilot don west ( leblanc , doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr . smith ( a watered-down but still-lively oldman , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute ) , the script\\'s \" stream \" of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along--and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting . \\nthey encounter another ship . \\nthey board it . \\nalien spiders attack them . \\nthey return to their ship . \\nthe other one explodes . \\nthey land on a deserted planet . \\nand so on . \\nan attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act , but goldsman doesn\\'t seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device ; when one character\\'s past self dies , the future incarnation inexplicably lives on . \\nthe look and effects should be lost in space\\'s ace-in-the-hole , but hopkins even manages to botch that . \\nfor a big-budget film , the visual effects are incredibly shoddy . \\nin one composite background shot , i could see the blue outline around oldman ; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like . . . \\ndigital effects . \\nbut nothing in those shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as blawp , a monkey-like space creature that becomes penny\\'s pet . \\nentirely computer-generated and every inch showing it , blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game . \\napparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it ; how else can one explain the graininess of blawp\\'s composite shots with the human actors ? \\nbut in doing so , the seams are that much more obvious . \\nyou have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of judy . \\nnew line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long-running star trek cash cow at paramount . \\ni don\\'t think so . \\nin a few years , the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question : what film ended titanic\\'s 15-week reign at the top of the weekend box office ? \\n',\n"," b'david schwimmer ( from the television

( jon voight ) who claims to know how to find the shirishama . \\nwithin minutes , they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness . \\nfrom that point

. \\nbut the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight . \\nobsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas , voight plays the villain in thick accent , with a series of leers and hisses , spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of \" jonny quest . \" \\nat one point , he looms over the crew and says \" the anaconda is the perfect

ambitious adaptation of king\\'s short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it . \\napt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses . \\n1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again . \\nbowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd\\'s theory . \\nbowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden\\'s intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view . \\nthe stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd\\'s desire for gory details overrides his repulsion . \\nbowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii . \\nmarching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his \" student \" , among other things . \\nbowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship . \\ndussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future . \\nall of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material\\'s excessive climax . \\nsinger has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system . \\nhis the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal\\'s tics and todd\\'s golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals . \\napt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway . \\nthankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects\\' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system . \\nsome scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer\\'s handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training . \\nmckellan\\'s and renfro\\'s performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan\\'s finely-tuned realization , i\\'d like to single out renfro\\'s daring work . \\nhe isn\\'t afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn\\'t do . \\n ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? ) \\nrenfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn\\'t continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him . \\nas guidance counsellor edward french , \" friend \" schwimmer also deserves mention . \\nhe wants to be the parent to todd that todd\\'s own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil\\'s blackening-heart even more apparent . \\nbut one of the film\\'s ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous . \\nno man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the \" right \" or the \" wrong \" choices . \\nschwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible . \\n-october , 1998 \\n * the excellent collection king\\'s stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) . \\n',\n"," b'james cmaeron\\'s breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok . \\nfor those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race . \\nhuman survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed . \\nhowever , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor . \\nto stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor\\'s mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born . \\nin response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn . \\nimages of machines and of humans\\' reliance on machines dominate the film . \\neven though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines . \\nin the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star . \\nin the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy . \\ncameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he\\'s not happy about it . \\nunabated technological growth brings about the terminator\\'s other obsession : the apocalypse . \\nwe have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la . \\nchildren watch the flames in a burning television . \\nwhen the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him . \\neven though the \" future is not set , \" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence . \\nall sara can do is await it . \\n ( cameron doesn\\'t wimp out like he does in terminator 2 ) \\nthe end of the world is the human race\\'s own fault , too . \\nafter all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . \\nback in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron\\'s ) . \\nthese days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans . \\ntrue , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield\\'s and lance henriksen\\'s detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . \\ncameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . \\nfrom a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . \\narnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . \\nwe are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger\\'s later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him . \\ncameron and hurd\\'s script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . \\nwhile we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese\\'s intentions . \\ncameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . \\neither the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs . \\nthe violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom\\'s heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator\\'s ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . \\nfor a low budget film , the terminator\\'s special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . \\nspecial mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . \\nit is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . \\none thing that doesn\\'t hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton\\'s hairdo . \\n',\n"," b\"i'm giving this stinker . \\nnormally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be . \\nbut the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg . \\ni'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all . \\nmaybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny . \\nin mine , it's not . \\nor maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking . \\nbecause only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one . \\nat least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing . \\nbrooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it . \\nwrong mel ! \\ni would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere . \\nthis idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad . \\nhe sends his goons to run the townsfolk out . \\nbut the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them . \\nthe governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr . \\n ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . ) \\nlamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave . \\nhold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass . \\nit's just too funny . \\nracism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ? \\noh wait , i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk . \\ni'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head . \\nbut i digress . \\nanyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word . \\ngolly , will the hilarity just never end ? \\nhe ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west . \\ntogether , they save the day from evil . \\nnot one person in this movie gives a decent performance . \\nwilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie . \\nok , he really didn't -- but he should have . \\nthe films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day . \\ni did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience . \\ni admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions . \\nactually , the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise , but alas , it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie . \\ni can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \\nmel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film . \\n\",\n"," b'titantic , writer and director james cameron\\'s much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? \\nas a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . \\nif you\\'ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . \\nthe movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world\\'s most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . \\nin either case , it is filmmaking at its best . \\nwhen we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . \\nhe said no but that the time would go by so fast she\\'d never notice the length . \\namazingly , he was right . \\ntitanic is one of the few long films that doesn\\'t suffer because of it . \\nthe lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean . \\nfortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world\\'s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as \" the ship of dreams . \" \\nthe necklace\\'s hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story . \\nalthough almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . \\nusing a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . \\nafter twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage . \\nin a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . \\nthe strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . \\nentering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane . \\nand thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class . \\neven with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes . \\nin contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board . \\nafter jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair . \\nnever tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . \\nleonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . \\nin so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part . \\nwhen he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal\\'s supercilious put-downs . \\nkate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . \\nthe chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what\\'s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . \\nfrom the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship\\'s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances . \\nif the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . \\npeter lamont\\'s sets are more than authentic . \\none scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck . \\nit then shifts to the ship\\'s massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . \\nthe handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner . \\neasily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . \\nat first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . \\nwhat a lark . \\nwe\\'ve struck an iceberg . \\nnow let\\'s get back to our brandy and cigars . \\nthe ship\\'s musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in . \\nafter all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers . \\nwhen the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it . \\ntheir civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . \\nthe story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . \\nthere are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . \\nspecial effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . \\nin titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs . \\nthe most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water . \\npeople are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . \\nbesides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . \\nfrom the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . \\n \" it\\'s good-bye for a little while , \" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first . \\n \" this boat\\'s for mommies and children . \\nthere\\'ll be a boat in a little while for daddies . \" \\nbasically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise . \\nperhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim\\'s on-board the ship . \\nin the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew . \\n \" no thanks , \" the elegantly attired guggenheim replies . \\n \" we\\'re dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen . \\nbut we would like a brandy . \" \\ntitanic runs 3 : 14 . \\nit is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up . \\n',\n"," b'nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage

sleepy hollow \" is his first attempt to actually scare people . \\ni greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton\\'s whole career seemed to be leading up to this . \\ni left disappointed .

\\nseveral of the town\\'s leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman . \\nalthough he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case

literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) . \\nmy reaction : ho-hum . \\nthe plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting . \\nthat in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages . \\nhowever , burton\\'s attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy . \\nit might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal . \\nalong the same lines , it doesn\\'t help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin

off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . \\nfew years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . \\nhowever , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . \\none of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon\\'s loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas . \\nbeing made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement . \\ntwo of them , following the murder of luger\\'s ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . \\nthe authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines . \\nthe plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film \" borrows \" its female lead from basic instinct ) . \\nthe best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers . \\nthe rest simply doesn\\'t work . \\nonly those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . \\nothers would probably wince at the lameness of humour . \\nsome would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . \\nbut , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort . \\nthe film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones . \\nthe authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel . \\n',\n"," b'in my review of \" the spy who shagged me , \" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore . \\nthe cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing . \\n \" scream 3 \" provides the latest proof of this rule . \\nin los angeles production has begun on \" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , \" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) . \\nhowever , life soon starts imitating art , and \" stab \" cast members turn up stabbed . \\nsmelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in \" stab 3 . \" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name . \\n . \\n . \\nuntil she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice . \\nthe late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy . \\nhe notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with . \\nindeed , \" scream 3 \" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney\\'s mother maureen before the beginning of the original \" scream . \" \\nat the scene of each murder in \" scream 3 , \" the killer leaves a photo of sidney\\'s mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer . \\nto find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen\\'s missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films . \\n ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer\\'s relationship to sidney is ) . \\nunlike its predecessors , \" scream 3 \" doesn\\'t have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer . \\nthe characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don\\'t even care who the killer is . \\nthe jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ? \\nthe kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ? \\nthe driven young director ( scott foley ) ? \\nthe ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ? \\nthe character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random . \\nwes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it\\'s quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen . \\nthe series\\' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious . \\npossibly it\\'s the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it\\'s that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche . \\ni groaned as an attack on sidney from the first \" scream \" was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home . \\nat some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas . \\n \" scream 3 \" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles . \\nlook for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from \" seinfeld \" ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point . \\nall these bit players put forth more effort than the series\\' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- \" scream \" job search . \\nanother prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying \" the blair witch project \" \\'s web strategy . \\n \" scream 3 \" has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie . \\nthe sunrise studios site ( scream3 . com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the \" latest \\'stab 3\\' news . \" \\nthere\\'s also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers . com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more \" stab \" scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks . com ) . \\ncraven and company promise that this is the last installment in the \" scream \" series . \\nwhile i hope that\\'s true , i don\\'t hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters . \\nthere\\'s a \" halloween h2k \" in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in \" h20 , \" and a \" freddy vs . jason \" has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were \" killed off . \" \\nthere\\'s bound to be a \" scream 4 \" someday , even if it starts over with a new set of movie-star wannabes . \\nbottom line : they should have called this one \" yawn . \" \\n',\n"," b' \" flubber \" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney . \\nit\\'s the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it\\'s boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless . \\nwhat could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it\\'s a shame because it could have been a great film . \\nhypothetically , i mean . \\n \" flubber , \" as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , \" the absent minded professor , \" where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as \" flubber , \" you know , flying rubber ? \\nthe new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several \" show-stopping \" moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse . \\nthe basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded . \\nin fact , he\\'s forgotten his wedding to the college\\'s president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning . \\ndoesn\\'t this warrant some kind of mental treatment ? \\nanyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in \" the abyss . \" \\nphilip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to . \\nthrough a plot twist , hoenicker\\'s goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just \\'cause he\\'s evil enough . \\na sub-plot involves philip\\'s attempts to win back sara , who\\'s angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip\\'s belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again ) . \\nand in another subplot , philip\\'s day-timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him . \\nyuckity-yuck . \\nwhat\\'s most pathetic about this film is how dull it is . \\nyou don\\'t need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up . \\nearlier in \\'97 , they released \" jungle 2 jungle , \" an adaptation of a really awful french film , \" un indien dans la ville , \" which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much . \\ndisney\\'s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively . \\nin the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called \" magic . \" \\nsuch scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh . \\ni sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes . \\nwho could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ? \\ndidn\\'t think so . \\nit doesn\\'t help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable . \\nphilip is not a lovable absent minded professory , just a really dumb man being played by robin williams . \\nwilliams is a brilliant comic actor . . . okay , a brilliant actor in general , but here he\\'s given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad . \\nthose times , he\\'s not bad . \\nbut what are we supposed to think of a man who\\'s forgotten his wedding thrice ? \\nmaybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s . . . \\ni like disney , and i usually enjoy their films , not only animated but live action , and their recent films ( save for \" hercules , \" which was good , but not great ) have been worse than lackluster , they\\'ve been pathetic . \\n \" jungle 2 jungle \" is probably the worst film i saw last year . \\n \" flubber \" \\'s probably second . \\nwhat do they need to do ? \\nperhaps create something new . \\nget writers who can write something that\\'s universally entertaining . \\nfilms like \" the parent trap \" and \" mary poppins \" are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both ) , but even i can still watch them because they\\'re not only written to be magical to children , but to be fun to adults . \\nwhat\\'s more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ? \\nand my god , couldn\\'t they have done something else with edie mcclurg ? \\n',\n"," b\"an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices . \\nthat's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow . \\nthat aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source . \\nthe acting in particular i found very good , the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie . \\na few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone , yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better . \\non the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot . \\nthe character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing . \\nas far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener . \\nall these people acted their parts admirably , as for the part that sharon stone played , she played it well but the part was not utilized enough . \\nthe directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie , this is one of those occasions . \\nmatthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ) . \\nthere is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this . \\nthe one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing , the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it . \\ni certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it . \\nall in all i found this movie boring and very slow , the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch . \\nalthough there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them . \\ni wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing

into a bathroom stall late at night . \\nok , we all know what\\'s coming , but as if we didn\\'t need any more confirmation , he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away . \\neveryone knows what

service . \\ntucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he\\'s also really the only thing good about the movie . \\nin fact , if you see \" money talks , \" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of \" toy story \" \\'s writers penned the sloppy script . \\ntucker\\'s role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen ) . \\nafter being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael ) . \\nbut villard\\'s thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo . \\nthe local media mistakenly puts the prison break-out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture . \\nhe makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview . \\nthis means james must present his new \" friend \" in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber-rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino ) . \\nand of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james . \\n \" this ain\\'t no buddy movie , \" claim the print ads . \\nyeah , right . \\nactually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears \" money talks \" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker . \\nthis is tucker\\'s first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african-american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r-rated raunch rather than pg-13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role . \\nbut you realize all too quickly that tucker\\'s overstated liveliness is the only thing \" money talks \" has going for it . \\nand a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make . \\nit\\'s all too easy to pick out everything wrong with \" money talks . \" \\nthe plot is recycled buddy-buddy comedy-thriller tripe that seemed overused even when \" nothing to lose \" employed it last month . \\neverything is paint-by-numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers . \\nthe villains , as many as there are , are dull . \\ncertain story elements are too coincidental . \\nand too much of the film\\'s dramatic agenda is played too straight . \\na scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin\\'s true identity ( \" you brought a killer into my parents\\' house ! \" ) \\nis extremely silly . \\nyou get the picture . \\nobviously , i did not have a pleasant experience at \" money talks . \" \\nbut the people around me appeared to be having a rip-roaring good time ( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health ) . \\nbut tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie\\'s best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone\\'s son at james and grace\\'s engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics . \\ntucker\\'s audience -- and he does have one -- will probably like \" money talks . \" \\nthose who he irritates , however , will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails . \\n',\n"," b\"ingredients : possessed plastic dolls in love , plastic dolls having sex

which sponge out any tension , suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually \" breaking down \" to the investigators without much reason given , a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters , as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly , and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the \" best poor man\\'s michael bay doing his best poor man\\'s impression of tony scott \" ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half-open shades for grit and integrity

including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants . \\nyippee ! \\nveteran director john frankenheimer ( ronin ( 7 . 5/10 ) , \\nthe manchurian candidate ) portrays the character of general sonnenberg

may remember him as prince\\'s father in purple rain . \\n',\n"," b'first troy beyer wrote the critically panned \" b . a . p . s . \" \\nnow she makes her directorial debut , writing , directing , and starring in this sub-par film about women talking about sex . \\nthough not without redeeming qualities , this film is bad . \\nthe basic story follows three single friends -- jazz ( beyer ) , lena ( randi ingerman ) , and michelle ( paget brewster ) -- in their search for love . \\njazz has an idea for a local talk show ; it would feature women talking about sex and dating . \\nshe and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami . \\nthe film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout , both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters . \\nthe fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film . \\nthere are several moments of bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . \\nin a low-budget independent film from a first-time director , these faults can sometimes be forgiven , if the screenplay is fresh and solid . \\nthat is not the case here . \\nthe script suffers from random plot developments . \\nthere are four or five of these turns in the plot , each one raising the question \" where did that come from ? \" \\nat one point , a character has a lifelong reconciliation with her mother . \\nwe are supposed to be moved , but since the scene is completely un-led-up to , we really don\\'t care if she and her mother get along . \\nwe\\'ve never seen her mother before . \\nwe never see her again . \\nwho cares ? \\nwhat\\'s worse , these sudden developments are supposed to engage our sympathy . \\nat another point , a character announces that she can\\'t have children . \\napparently , this is devastating . \\nwe wouldn\\'t know this because she never talked about having kids before , but we are nevertheless expected to be devastated for her . \\nthe scene feels like an afterthought , its emotion manipulative and shallow . \\nthese scenes grow worse and worse , culminating in an absurd climax . \\ntwo scenes were played with such overwhelming melodrama that i found myself laughing . \\none scene is a lover\\'s spat between two minor characters . \\nthe other has the main characters expressing their copious grief by cleaning house in wails of despair and clouds of ajax . \\nthinking on these scenes , it is hard for me to admit that the film has redeeming qualities . \\nbut it does . \\nfirst , it is original . \\nwe men often wonder what women talk about when they are alone in groups , and i imagine this film gives me a pretty good idea . \\nit\\'s something i don\\'t think has been the subject of a film . \\nsecond , the interviews of the miami women are sincere . \\ntaken together , they form a mosaic picture of miami beachwalkers and bistro diners . \\nthe mosaic is made of sound bites and stereotypes , but each tile is some woman\\'s real experience . \\nneither the picture of women , nor their picture of men , is truly representative , but the point is that both sets of generalizations are telling in their own way . \\nat some level , the stereotypes that emerge can be called true . \\ni can imagine some people liking this film when its characters talk about their \" likes , dislikes , skills , and thrills , \" but on the whole , it\\'s pretty bad . \\nand that makes it even harder to forgive the bad acting , corny dialogue , and emotional overextension . \\ni\\'ll give beyer one more strike , and then she\\'s out . \\nrated r ( almost got an nc-17 ) for explicit sexual dialogue and nudity . \\n',\n"," b' \" the beach \" is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder . \\nevery forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act . \\nit starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment . \\nbut then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of \" blue lagoon \" . \\nforty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of \" lord of the flies \" where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs . \\nby the time it\\'s over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about . \\nthe main character of \" the beach \" is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) . \\nhe travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you\\'re looking for a good time . \\nrichard\\'s voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown . \\nthis seedy environment is just what richard is looking for . \\nhe checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) . \\nhe seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis . \\nthough his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen . \\nmoreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life . \\ncaptivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey . \\nthey are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard\\'s . \\nonce they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard\\'s growing desire for francoise . \\nthis particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard . \\netienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand . \\nit\\'s odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view . \\nand once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers . \\nfor example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards . \\nand the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark . \\nthere are several ideas that are introduced in \" the beach \" and each one could merit its own feature-length film . \\nthere\\'s the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle . \\nbut the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred . \\ndicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through . \\nconsequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up . \\n',\n"," b'mickey mouse had better watch his back -- there\\'s a new critter in town , and he\\'s the nameless animal attraction of \" mouse hunt , \" dreamworks skg\\'s clever first foray into family fare . \\nalthough it runs out of steam towards its end , this live-action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney\\'s entire 1997 non-animated , kiddie-oriented catalog . . . \\nbut consider that list includes dismal tripe like \" air bud , \" \" flubber \" and \" that darn cat , \" and it\\'s really not such a difficult feat to pull off . \\nstill , throw the two rodents in a boxing arena , and i\\'ll be hoping that the mouse from \" mouse hunt \" knocks some sense back into mickey . \\nnathan lane ( robin williams\\' significant other from \" the birdcage \" ) and lee evans ( last seen as a nervous bellhop in \" the fifth element \" ) play ernie and lars smuntz , befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father ( william hickey , in his last role ) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion . \\nalthough lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former , he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect . \\nbut there\\'s a lone obstacle in their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house , and he\\'s not about to give up his place of residence without a fight . \\nmovies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite . \\nthe effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice , one animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty seamless . \\nthe splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton\\'s mind ; the smuntz\\'s architecturally-unsound mansion is like something straight out of \" the nightmare before christmas , \" and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price\\'s warped contraptions from \" edward scissorhands . \" \\n \" mouse hunt \" is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it\\'s hardly ever mean-spirited . \\nthe star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse . \\nit\\'s lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans\\' banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie\\'s more flashy physical shtick . \\nvicki lewis ( beth from \" newsradio \" ) is solid in a supporting role as lars\\' money-grubbing wife . \\nand in a nifty bit of novelty casting , christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously , popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a \" calcium deficiency . \" \\nblech . \\na basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution . \\ntheir sparring is imaginatively realized ( i don\\'t think i\\'ll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that\\'s okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share . \\n \" mouse hunt \" may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set-up could test the patience of some of the younger children , although i rather liked it , much in part to lane and evans ) , and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long , but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable , not unlike the original \" home alone . \" \\n',\n"," b'ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . \\nfor his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) . \\ndespite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . \\nthe film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england . \\nas the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback . \\nmeanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest . \\nlucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology . \\nlucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . \\nlucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . \\nyet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it\\'s on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . \\nand fate has decreed that they will one day meet . \\nthat day doesn\\'t occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . \\nanother of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory . \\nat first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn\\'t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . \\na friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . \\nbut oscar is uncertain of lucinda\\'s affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . \\noscar and lucinda isn\\'t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . \\non more than one occasion , it\\'s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . \\ncoincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can\\'t go anywhere . \\nthe voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . \\n ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) \\nyet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . \\nstoryline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . \\nthematically , the film is also strong . \\nthe unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . \\noscar and lucinda don\\'t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . \\na card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional \" strip poker \" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . \\noscar does not see gambling as a vice . \\nin fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one\\'s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . \\nralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . \\nthe actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . \\nas good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . \\nthe actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford\\'s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . \\nshe gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . \\neffective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen\\'s persuasion ) as lucinda\\'s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar\\'s mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer . \\nthere\\'s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . \\n ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) \\nwith the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . \\nthe characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . \\nso who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? \\noscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . \\n',\n"," b\"claire danes , giovanni ribisi , and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists , but they're just about the only palatable element of the mod squad , a lame-brained big-screen version of the 70s tv show . \\nthe story has all the originality of a block of wood ( well , it would if you could decipher it ) , the characters are all blank slates , and scott silver's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come . \\nby sheer force of talent , the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they're on screen , but the mod squad is just a second-rate action picture with a first-rate cast . \\n\",\n"," b'i can imagine how good krippendorf\\'s tribe must have looked on paper . \\nit does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film . \\nin fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf\\'s tribe as possible . \\nin retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been . \\ni shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss . \\ndreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea . \\nhalfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies . \\ni say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established . \\nlater , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures . \\nso , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie . \\nhe makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video . \\nhe simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu ) . \\naudiences at krippendorf\\'s lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision . \\nand proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community . \\nlike all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero . \\ndreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film . \\nhe has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically . \\nthis film also requires a lot of physical humor that i\\'ve never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job . \\njenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf\\'s work , is also very funny and appealing here . \\nand the kid actors are great , as well . \\nbut we\\'re talking about the script from hell . \\nthis is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen . \\nbut the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it . \\nall the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew . \\nno , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched . \\nfurthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless . \\ntake , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex . \\nthey get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin . \\nkrippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe . \\nnow , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , \" no , that would be far too tasteless . \\nthere\\'s no way they\\'ll do that . . . oh \\ngod ! \" \\nthey did do it . \\nit\\'s there . \\ni was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn\\'t bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film . \\ni found it deplorable . \\nand when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice . \\nthe film is filled with scenes like these . \\nthey not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays . \\nit would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon . \\nand watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes . \\nif i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely . \\nmoving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes . \\nsure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes . \\nit is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film . \\nhis character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does . \\ni suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something . \\nno , this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) didn\\'t include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad . \\nin fact , it\\'s his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings . \\ni suppose it\\'s important to admit that this is a funny film . \\ndreyfuss and elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture that is anything but boring . \\nand if you\\'re less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it . \\ni , however , can\\'t get past these elements . \\nkrippendorf\\'s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn\\'t be learning . \\nwith a little more insight into its story and themes , this could have been a good movie . \\n',\n"," b'martin scorsese\\'s films used to intimidate me . \\nbecause of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . \\nas much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . \\ni learned from scorsese\\'s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . \\nno mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . \\nfor example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . \\nthere was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . \\nor toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . \\nagain , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . \\ni don\\'t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . \\nbut he simply uses the best tool for the job . \\nit shouldn\\'t have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . \\nthe movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . \\nthe movie\\'s title is another name for the dalai lama which means \" ocean of wisdom . \" \\nhis story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . \\n ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film\\'s opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) \\nwe first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . \\nhis curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . \\na test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . \\nseveral items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . \\nthe child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . \\nthe boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . \\nscorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . \\nbefore selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . \\nsometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . \\neither way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . \\n>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama\\'s spirit and the future leader of a nation . \\nit is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . \\nin the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . \\nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . \\nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . \\ncertain patterns take shape over the years . \\nfor example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . \\nradios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . \\nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . \\nhe also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . \\nit\\'s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . \\nbut the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet\\'s gigantic neighbor , china . \\ntibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . \\nthe chinese invasion is so successful that the lama\\'s life is in danger if he stays . \\nthe movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . \\nthe story doesn\\'t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . \\nit just doesn\\'t fit that mold . \\nif it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . \\nthe pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . \\nthe structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . \\nperhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . \\na mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . \\nthe robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . \\nthe bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . \\neven the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . \\nphilip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . \\nfor those who don\\'t know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . \\nhis building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . \\nthese patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . \\npeople won\\'t be flocking to kundun for it\\'s great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . \\nit gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . \\non top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look . \\n',\n"," b'studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it\\'s a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn\\'t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film . \\nare we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ? \\n \" 54 \" belongs in the elite group of films known as \" the big disappointments \" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished . \\ni was heavily awaiting \" 54 , \" not the least because i\\'ve become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that\\'s been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this \" edgy \" film . \\nperhaps more importantly , \" 54 \" is part of the blossoming subgenre , \" the 70s nostalgia film , \" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with \" boogie nights \" and \" the last days of disco \" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from \" boogie nights , \" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from \" the last days of disco , \" not to mention several others . \\n \" 54 \" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that\\'s all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it . \\nthis is a definite plus . \\nhere\\'s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening . \\nthe story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let\\'s look at how it all affected the people . \\nbut this film doesn\\'t let that happen . \\nit gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o\\'shea ( ryan phillippe , from \" i know what you did last summer \" ) , who\\'s chief character trait is the fact that he\\'s from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) . \\nhe\\'s dim-witted , into being part of \" the scene , \" and soon finds he\\'s become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a \\nbit like \" saturday night fever , \" \\'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him . \\npoor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been . \\nshane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from \" clueless \" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame . \\nalthough he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that\\'s all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film . \\nthe film\\'s sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) . \\nrubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that . \\nnotice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who\\'ve only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails . \\nfirst time feature director mark christopher proves that he\\'s a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much . \\nhis story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject . \\nit\\'s as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route . \\nthe studio\\'s recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough . \\nsome people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film\\'s tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini\\'s \" la dolce vita \" ) , and when i watched \" 54 , \" i didn\\'t particularly want to stay . \\n',\n"," b'starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see . \\ntherefore , it\\'s with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . \\ndespite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . \\na group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the \" savages \" that live there . \\nthe natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . \\nonly the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . \\nthe ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film\\'s finer moments . \\nthe characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . \\ngovernor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . \\ncaptain john smith is a blond hunk who , while \" slightly \" misguided , is good at heart . \\npocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . \\nshe even comes complete with insignificant best friend . \\nagain , against tradition , talking animals aren\\'t used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . \\nthis is an odd compromise , but it\\'s one of the few elements that really work . \\nthe animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . \\nmaybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . \\nthe talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . \\nthe music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , \" colors of the wind . \" \\nmel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . \\nthe opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . \\ni was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . \\neven the children in the audience seemed restless . \\nwhile there\\'s no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . \\nperhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . \\nit\\'s all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie\\'s entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn\\'t work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer\\'s minds and plot holes that are never filled . \\neven the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . \\nas mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . \\nfor instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with \" savages , \" why did he so quickly change his previous \" kill as many indians as i can \" attitude . \\nif he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . \\nor how about pocahontas\\' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? \\ni can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . \\nas it is , i wonder if it doesn\\'t give kids the wrong impression . \\nin short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . \\nwhile disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . \\n',\n"," b\"let's face it : since waterworld floated by , the summer movie season has grown * very * stale . \\nwith no new eye-candy for four weeks straight , we've had to sustain ourselves on the quasi-nutritional value of cheatin' husbands , traveling chocolate salesmen , and computer- generated serial killers . \\nsigh . \\nthank god for desperado . \\nthe freewheeling sequel to el mariachi--director robert rodriguez's notorious $7000 debut--stars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name . \\nhe's a man in black with revenge on his mind , and an arsenal in his case . \\n ( the woman he loved was killed in the first film . ) \\nso , he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers ; sort of a tex-mex version of the punisher , if you will . \\nthere isn't much of an emotional core to desperado . \\nrodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo . \\n ( and sergio leone . . . \\nand sam peckinpah . . . ) \\nsome may wince at the body count--at least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimate--but it's all played for laughs . \\nbig , broad , hispanic laughs that , for me , recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films . \\nsick , slick fun . \\n\",\n"," b' \" gordy \" is not a movie , it is a 90-minute-long \" sesame street \" skit , and a very bad one at that . \\nthis movie is so stupid and dumb that it\\'s depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie . \\ni\\'m sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it . \\nit is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to \" up north , \" which we know means death . \\nof course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible . \\nactually , it\\'s almost funny in a way . \\nthe only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him . \\njinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it . \\nwhat is the point of this ? \\nmaybe she is one of the producer\\'s relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something . \\nwe then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating . \\nhe leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $200 suit on - nah , didn\\'t see that one coming ! ) , \\nstarts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him . \\nif this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank\\'s grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . . \\nand gordy ! \\nof course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) isn\\'t that evil . \\nhe never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story . \\nit\\'s hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker\\'s are just this untalented and stupid . \\nat times \" gordy \" is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded \" z- . \" \\nbut it\\'s just so unbelievably boring , cliche , dumb , unfunny , corny , and just plain bad it may scare children , it certainly disturbed me . \\n ( 4/21/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also : \" babe \" ] \\n',\n"," b'david lynch\\'s \" blue velvet \" begins and ends with colorful , bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town . \\nhowever , what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a \" strange world \" of drug dealers , sadists , and murderers . \\nthe opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy , disturbing film . \\nthey show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances . \\nodd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film , its characters , its direction , and its story . \\nthankfully , the obscurity that \" blue velvet \" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable . \\nsince its elements are so originally weird , you never know what will happen next . \\nthis is the main goal of a movie ; to be spontaneous and surprising . \\n \" blue velvet \" miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting . \\nlynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling . \\nthe film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy ( kyle maclachlan ) . \\nfrom this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer ( isabella rossellinia ) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping . \\nthe plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch\\'s story telling so amazing . \\nmaclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship , in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick , and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends . \\nthrough these multiple stories , maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan , we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots . \\nlynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion . \\ninstead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times . \\nlynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine . \\nhowever , for fans of odd difficult indies , \" blue velvet \" could be just what they are looking for . \\nit is very hard to discuss \" blue velvet \" without discussing the performance of dennis hopper\\'s sadistic frank . \\nmost of the other actors in the film were not very memorable . \\nkyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role , a personality . \\nlaura dern was consistently annoying . \\nbut dennis hopper stole every scene he was in . \\nhis evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask . \\nfrank is a character that comes along once in a blue moon . \\nmany producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy . \\njust like his villain in \" speed \" , hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak . \\nthis harshness is exactly what frank is , so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him , even if he theatens you to look away . \\n \" blue velvet \" has characters and stories you will never see in a movie again . \\nfor this sole reason it is recommended . \\nbut also see it to admire lynch\\'s obsession to avoid the norm . \\neven if this film is a little too weird for you , it\\'s hard not to congratulate a guy for trying something new and sticking to it . \\n',\n"," b'in the james bond film \" diamonds are forever , \" tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads . \\nbond\\'s response is that it doesn\\'t really matter , as long as collars and cuffs match . \\nwell , collars and cuffs don\\'t match in \" the real blonde . \" \\nwhat might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny , meandering comedy on screen . \\nthe film , supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business , is wafer thin . \\nit plays like an \" ally mcbeal \" episode dragged out to the nth degree , replete with a few unnecessary \" fantasy \" sequences . \\nwriter/director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea . \\nit isn\\'t . \\nthe only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary . \\nmatthew modine plays joe , a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent . \\nhe\\'s 35 with no agent and no credits since he\\'s too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas . \\n \" that\\'s not really acting \" he tells his girlfriend of six years , mary ( catherine keener ) , with whom he bickers constantly about sex . \\nbut they need the money , so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video . \\nbut it\\'s not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley , still trying to jump-start her career after \" showgirls \" ) . \\nthis points out how artificial this whole business is , one supposes . \\ndicillo has referred to \" the real blonde \" as \" off-kilter , but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff . . . \" \\nthe film , which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere , is remarkably * on * -kilter and , with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable modine ( who\\'s not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks ) , the entire cast is vague and uninteresting . \\ncatherine keener , who\\'s appeared in dicillo\\'s previous three films ( including the brilliant \" living in oblivion \" ) , is at her most annoying in \" the real blonde . \" \\nlook at her closely ; she really can\\'t act at all . \\nher reactions are all wrong , almost always out of sync with her co-stars . \\nshe reacts too soon , or too late , to lines and situations . \\nshe moves her eyes , or her mouth , far too much . \\nshe frowns , she yells , she babbles--she blows chunks . \\nmaxwell caulfield plays joe\\'s actor/waiter buddy bob , the one obsessed with dating a \" natural \" blonde . \\nbob\\'s personality ( not to mention caulfield\\'s acting ability ) parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera \" passion crest \" --stiff and uninteresting . \\nmaybe that\\'s the point . \\ndaryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title , a soap dish who beds bob both on- and off-camera . \\nhannah looks about fifty in this movie ( she\\'s only 37 ) . \\nwhy is that ? \\nalmost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples . \\nwhy is that ! ? \\nmarlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer . \\nkathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent . \\nbuck henry plays an uninteresting shrink . \\nchristopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer . \\nand so on . \\nthe best parts of the \" the real blonde \" are the beginning and the end , brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog . \\nthere\\'s more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive face than in the entire film . \\nwhile this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters\\' lives , the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it\\'s funny . \\n',\n"," b'my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . \\ni love ralph fiennes . \\ni love uma thurman . \\ni love sean connery . \\nhell , i\\'m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . \\ni saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i\\'ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . \\na few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . \\nthen , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . \\nand that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . \\nand that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . \\nmy expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . \\nthe film i saw today didn\\'t even meet those expectations . \\nthis is a lousy , incoherent mess . \\ni would slam it harder , if it weren\\'t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . \\nbut sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . \\nthat\\'s the main problem with the avengers : for all it\\'s hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . \\nit\\'s like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . \\nit also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . \\nthis is just plain depressing . \\nthe avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . \\nfrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i\\'ve never watched an episode . \\ni wasn\\'t alive then . \\ni don\\'t even watch television now . \\ni\\'m very sorry that i don\\'t have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i\\'ve already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . \\ni didn\\'t know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . \\ni also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . \\nbased on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . \\nthey are to work together , under mother\\'s orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . \\nit seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . \\nhis name is de wynter ( connery ) . \\nhe is a crazy scottish guy . \\nour heroes had better stop him , or else . \\n . \\n . \\nthe weather will keep getting colder until they \" have to go to hell to warm up \" ( one of the film\\'s few funny lines ) . \\nalong the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . \\nfor example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . \\nnow , killer bugs don\\'t really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . \\nthe purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . \\nthey\\'re never even directly connected to de wynter ( they\\'re controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . \\nthe special effects aren\\'t bad , but they\\'re loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . \\nlike so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . \\nand i guarantee you , it will wane . \\ni stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn\\'t do any good to think . \\nthe avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn\\'t tell us what happens . \\nthere are several scenes in the preview that didn\\'t make the final cut . \\nin addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . \\nthe scenes that don\\'t feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . \\nthey aren\\'t . \\nthe action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . \\nthey aren\\'t , either . \\nand what about this wasted cast ? \\noh , it makes me weep with disappointment . \\nwe\\'re talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . \\ni love the guy . \\ni\\'ve loved all his films , until this one . \\nhe seems like he wants to understand the film , but he\\'s as lost as we are . \\nand thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can\\'t manage to look at home here . \\n ( i don\\'t blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can\\'t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) \\nconnery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . \\nwho is to blame ? \\nis it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? \\nperhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . \\nis it the actors ? \\nfor god\\'s sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . \\ni blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn\\'t have been given the task to begin with . \\nhis best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . \\nadd to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . \\nif the avengers has a saving grace , it\\'s the set design . \\nthe sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . \\ni like the final set-piece , on de wynter\\'s island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . \\ni admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . \\ni also enjoyed michael kamen\\'s music score , particularly in the opening credits . \\nbut this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there\\'s a lot more that needs to be here . \\ninspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . \\nmaybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . \\nor a sense of purpose . \\nmost of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . \\ndamn this movie for not giving them the chance . \\n',\n"," b'this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation . \\nbut lo and

nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while . \\nhe is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn\\'t keep him from offering pursuit . \\nlacrosse\\'s most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man . \\nin a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado . \\nalong the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) . \\nthis tangent isn\\'t a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself . \\nor is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about . \\nin a sense , that\\'s half of the basic problem with \" switchback . \" \\nfor its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we\\'re given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we\\'ll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction . \\nbut \" switchback \" then decides to explicitly reveal the killer\\'s identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense . \\nsome of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves . \\nwhat is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ? \\nand dennis quaid ? \\n ( that monotone -- stop it ! ) \\nermey is solid in a supporting role that\\'s more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes\\' object of affection in \" my so-called life \" ) is a scene-stealer tried and true . \\n>from a material standpoint , \" switchback \" is pretty empty . \\nbut even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote \" the fugitive \" and \" die hard \" ) doesn\\'t know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals . \\nthe set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor . \\nstill , that\\'s not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie\\'s look will end up leaving you cold . \\n',\n"," b\"there ? s nothing quite like a gory anime . \\nreally , and this is the truth , no other genre in film gets away with such violence without a word being said in the media about it . \\nwith anime , a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two , and the rest of the insides falling out seconds afterword . \\nthis is a standard practice in anime , or at least the half dozen or so titles that i ? ve seen . \\nvampire hunter d is a gory , gory film . \\nif they ever made a live version of the film , it would be banned in several countries and given a rating somewhere below xxx . \\nit ? s not that it ? s gore is unique - it ? s just like other gory animes - but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it ? s story , characters , animation , etc . . . \\nit really didn ? t . \\nit was disgusting and gruesome , which overshadowed the story , what little of it there was . \\nit seems that in the not too distant future vampires and evil control the world , because god knows that our local police force just can ? t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies . \\none evening , a blond peasant girl , drawn to look 17 and innocent ( a foreshadow that we will see her naked , i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene ) is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire ( insert strom thurmand joke here . ) \\nof course , he never put a ? no trespassing ? sign on his yard , so one can ? t really blame her , but he ? s upset anyway and demands retribution . \\nshe gets the obligatory bite on the neck ( aren ? t there other places to get blood from ? \\nit seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough . \\nif it's good enough for doctors to draw blood from , then why do vampires stray from that sight ? ) \\nto fight the spell , she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall , dark and handsome vampire hunter ( you guessed it , his name is d ) . \\nthe vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires , being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not to talk too much . \\nyou see , like all heroes in these kinds of stories , he ? s a brooder , who ? s sole purpose in life is to remain really , really silent . \\nwhen he speaks , it ? s in cliches . \\nheroes like this are bad when they ? re live , even worse when animated . \\nlater the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire , who wants to marry the peasant girl because he ? s bored after 10 , 000 years of living ( the only clever vampire insight made in the movie ) , will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time ? \\nwill we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable ? \\nin it ? s defense , the animation , when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing , could at times be original . \\nthe talking hand was clever - and i think the inspiration for a skateboard-related logo . \\nand that ? s the best defense i can think of . \\ni understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans , but i really don ? t see it . \\nit ? s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth , blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks , and most importantly , like all violent anime , it is an excuse to see animated breasts . \\nwhy ? \\nwhat is the point of that ? \\nmaybe i have to understand the genre and look past the obsessive gore and mysogny . \\ni ? m not a prude , i just don ? t think it ? s warranted . \\nit puts itself so far out in front of the movie that everything else gets lost . \\nis there a neccesity in seeing a 17 year old in the shower ? \\nof course not ? it ? s done for shock . \\nit ? s tasteless and despicable . \\n\",\n"," b\"mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect . \\na weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile . \\nhowever , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever . \\njackie chan plays , who else , jackie . \\nthis time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show . \\nnot that it ever makes a difference in the plot . \\nthere are only two scenes of him cooking . \\nfor the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop . \\nit never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ? \\na tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons . \\nalthough she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm , \\nshades of broadcast news ? ? ? \\nanyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape . \\nhere lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? \\noh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense . \\nas luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape . \\nthis leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie . \\nin a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language . \\nhowever , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases . \\nstrangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too . \\nwhether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films . \\nthe plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons . \\nbut even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread . \\nlook , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? \\nwatching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts . \\nthe action is a mixed bag here . \\nthere's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films . \\nit takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan . \\nthe action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes . \\nthe film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting . \\nonce or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence . \\nbut to slo-mo jackie running ? \\neither this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down . \\nif you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy . \\nhowever , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop . \\n\",\n"," b\"ironically , one of the themes of 200 cigarettes is that you should try to make the best of every moment in life . \\nunfortunately i will no longer be able to say that i lived every moment of my life to the fullest , because i spent 95 otherwise perfectly good minutes , watching this sad excuse for a movie . \\nactually smoking 200 cigarettes in the same 95 minutes couldn't be any worse for you than it is to watch the movie . \\nnot only is it a pathetically bad film overall , but 200 cigarettes actually has no redeeming qualities whatsoever . \\nthe plot is scattered , thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video . \\nit is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house . \\nbut no one has arrived yet . \\nher 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups . \\nsome of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers . \\nbut they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end . \\nthose who are invited are the ones that have the issues . \\nit is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms . \\nfirst there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . \\nhe is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . \\nbridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them . \\nthey stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections . \\nhe is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . \\nhis lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . \\nas bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . \\nmoving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . \\nval is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . \\non the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find . \\nparadoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . \\nof all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . \\nwisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . \\npaul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . \\nhowever , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . \\nfinally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film . \\njack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before . \\nwhile she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . \\nvery often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . \\nhowever , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . \\ninstead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . \\nfirst , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . \\nat other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . \\nthere are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . \\nnot in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . \\nand yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . \\nperhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . \\nbut it didn't happen that way . \\nthe cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight . \\n\",\n"," b' \" virus \" is a monster movie without a monster . \\nany movie with a hurdle that large to overcome had better be pretty damn good otherwise . \\nsadly , \" virus \" does not deliver , on any level . \\nthe movie opens with the russian space station mir about to transmit something ( we never find out what ) to a big boat with lots of satellites on it . \\nsudddenly , a wave of colorful lightning comes flying through space , and winds up destroying mir and using it to transmit itself to the aforementioned big boat . \\ncut to seven days later , we meet donald sutherland and his band of seafaring vultures . \\nsee , they spend all their time sailing around looking for dead-in-the-water ships to rescue , and then collect the reward money . \\nat least , i * think * that\\'s what they do . \\nalong with many other things in the film , their reason for being out in the middle of the ocean isn\\'t really explained . \\nso , they stumble upon this big boat with lots of satellites on it , and decide to haul it back to russian waters . \\nthe only problem is , the crew starts disappearing one-by-one and turning into borg . \\nyes , borg . \\ncomplete with the red laser beam in place of an eye . \\napparently , this alien lifeform can only survive if inside something electrical . \\nso , it creates make-shift machines and uses humans for \" spare parts \" . \\nblah , blah , blah . \\ni could go on forever describing the ludicrous so-called plot , but i won\\'t . \\nsuffice it to say the most original thing about this movie is having donald sutherland play an irish man ( ! ) . \\neverything else in this movie has been taken from other ( better ) movies . \\nfor example , many of the machines resemble those found in the little-seen japanese movie , \" tetsuo-the iron man \" . \\nand the plot is right out of \" aliens \" . \\nthe funny thing is , i was actually expecting to enjoy this movie . \\ni have a soft spot for cheesy monster movies , like last years under-appreciated \" deep rising \" . \\nbut \" virus \" , as i mentioned earlier , doesn\\'t even have a monster . \\nit just has a big pile of circuits and wires and expects the audience to fear this ridiculous looking contraption . \\n \" virus \" is the type of movie that really makes you wonder what the screenwriter was thinking about when he wrote it . \\nbesides the lame \" monster \" , it\\'s chock full of dialogue that no real person would ever say , and situations that no real person would ever allow themselves to get into . \\nfor example , there is a scene late in the movie in which one of the characters actually attempts to * negotiate * with the alien ! \\nnow , i don\\'t know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that viewed mankind as a virus to be eliminated , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it . \\nthat makes about as much sense as a baby squirrel calmly asking a fierce predator to spare his life . \\nfinally , \" virus \" isn\\'t scary . \\nthe least the filmmakers could have done was to make the movie just a little scary . \\nas it is , it\\'s about as frightening as a box of cookies . \\nskip \" virus \" . \\nif it\\'s a cool monster movie

a peaceful community of 600 , the ba\\'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru\\'afro . \\nthe enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba\\'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba\\'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . \\ncomments : \" star trek : the next generation \" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to \" star trek , \" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . \\neven though it still enjoyed high ratings , \" star trek : the next generation \" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original \" star trek \" \\'s cast in paramount\\'s film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . \\nstar trek : insurrection is the ninth \" star trek \" movie and the third to focus on the \" star trek : the next generation \" crew . \\nstar trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between \" okay \" and \" good . \" \\nafter star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant \" star trek : voyager \" tv series , \" star trek \" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . \\ni don\\'t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . \\nmost people reading this probably haven\\'t followed \" star trek \" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . \\nlet me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it\\'s out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection\\'s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . \\nokay . let\\'s move to the movie itself . \\nstar trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity\\'s exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . \\nthis combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . \\nmuch of this film appeals to trek fans\\' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise\\'s crew . \\naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . \\nstar trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba\\'ku homeworld . \\nforget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . \\nthis tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba\\'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son\\'a . \\nit seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . \\nthe enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data\\'s actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son\\'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba\\'ku and plunder the planet\\'s youth-restoring properties . \\nsound pretty heavy ? \\nit is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film\\'s constant barrage of humor . \\nwhen going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . \\nin a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba\\'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . \\nthe acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . \\nsince they\\'ve been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . \\nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard\\'s trademark , with his usual aplomb . \\nbrent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . \\nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . \\ndespite many other critics\\' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru\\'afro well enough . \\nru\\'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . \\nlike the baron , ru\\'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . \\nin one particularly memorable scene , ru\\'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . \\nru\\'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . \\n ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) \\ndonna murphy must also be noted as a ba\\'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . \\nmurphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . \\nthis is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . \\nin fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . \\na particular plot point involving anij\\'s ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . \\nfor as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection\\'s special effects were surprisingly disappointing . \\nthey proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . \\nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru\\'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . \\nthe new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn\\'t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . \\ndespite star trek : insurrection\\'s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . \\nit maintains roddenberry\\'s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don\\'t get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . \\ni\\'d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . \\nrated pg , i can\\'t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old . \\n',\n"," b'after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash . \\nmaybe not ! \\nmindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether . \\ntango & cash has \" lowest common denominator \" written all over it . \\nthe movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l . a . russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts . \\nstallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn\\'t need the money . \\nin an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits . \\nthe two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names . \\ntango & cash is unbearably noisy . \\nfor starters , there\\'s harold faltermeyer\\'s annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes . \\nto make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier . \\nin fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases . \\nthere\\'s nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie . \\nscreenwriter randy feldman\\'s brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv . \\nhis shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone\\'s efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual . \\nin a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier . \\nit\\'s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman\\'s script and thinking , \" i want to be in this movie . \" \\nthe film\\'s plot doesn\\'t have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting . \\nfeldman\\'s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable . \\nthey simply could have called it \" action movie . \" \\nevery character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies . \\nadding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a \" road runner \" cartoon . \\naction movies don\\'t have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you\\'re not thinking about the lack of realism . \\nthe only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography . \\nthere are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires . \\nthe film\\'s main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell . \\nunfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants . \\nthe dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing . \\nit\\'s a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming \" lethal weaponesque \" adventure . \\ntango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes . \\nseeing russell in drag is the movie\\'s funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials . \\nfurthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence . \\nmachine guns and torture generally don\\'t mix well with comedy . \\njack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain . \\nhis character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice . \\nlike many movie villains , palance likes to play games . \\nin fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room . \\nyou have to wonder why palance doesn\\'t just shoot the detectives in the head ! \\nthe story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent . \\nteri hatcher plays stallone\\'s sister and russell\\'s love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be . \\nbut regrettably , hatcher\\'s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty . \\nevery time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination . \\nthere\\'s really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film . \\nand , more to the point , tango definitely isn\\'t worth a penny of your cash--so don\\'t bother . \\n',\n"," b'pitch black is a sheep in wolf\\'s clothing . \\nit is full of darkness , danger and violence and if you buy into the marketing hype , an unsettling and scary film going experience . \\ndon\\'t be fooled . \\npitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare-fest . \\nit starts off with blistering intensity . \\na cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns . \\namong the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship\\'s pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely . \\nthere is imam ( david ) , an islamic leader whose faith in his god is tested repeatedly throughout the film . \\nthere is a law enforcement officer in the form of johns ( hauser ) , who attacks every situation with square jawed authoritarian zeal . \\nand there is riddick ( diesel ) , a menacing , muscle-bound convicted murderer who\\'s being brought back to justice by johns . \\nthe group quickly sizes up the situation and each other . \\nconfident in their assessment of matters , a plan is set in motion to escape their hellish environment . \\nthose plans are shredded by the appearance of one of the planet\\'s wildlife , a predatory , sometimes winged , species that enjoys the taste of blood and flesh . \\nfortunately , the creatures are light sensitive and are forced to live in networks of catacombs under the planet\\'s surface . \\nunfortunately , the group has managed to land on the planet moments before an eclipse is about to occur , taking away their one protection from the monsters . \\nthe group\\'s savior comes in the form of johns , whose decisive leadership looks to deliver them from purgatory . \\nor does it ? \\npitch black deviates from the standard sci-fi fare by avoiding some of the stock \" escape the boogieman \" conflicts the genre typically serves up . \\njust as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false . \\nthe excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth . \\na recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations . \\ni found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist . \\nconversely , imam constantly contributes any good fortune to allah . \\none by one , his perceived heaven sent blessings are taken away and crushed . \\nimam is forced to reassess his faith . \\nanother character expresses belief in god , along with a life long hate . \\nyet another character makes a decision that echoes the sentiments of christ about selflessness and has lasting

called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands . \\nit wasn\\'t just the film\\'s disappointing box office performance . \\nindeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times . \\nno , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year . \\nin a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : \" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! \" . \\nexecutives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late . \\nmommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history . \\nunfortunately , faye dunaway\\'s energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film\\'s only redeeming feature . \\nbased on daughter christina crawford\\'s trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother . \\nif you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania . \\nthe film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother\\'s will . \\njoan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see . \\nbut that\\'s about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film\\'s end . \\nthe script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum . \\nfrank perry\\'s direction is no more than competent , and dunaway\\'s bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving . \\nin fairness , the film\\'s second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters . \\nwhen the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina\\'s own acting and career ambitions . \\ncrawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain . \\nyou also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers . \\nah , but there is dunaway\\'s performance . \\nand what a delicious piece of campery it often is . \\nhaving just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden . \\nshe has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she\\'s making . \\nspotting a young tree she doesn\\'t like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line \" tina ! ! \\nfetch me the axe ! ! \" \\nwith which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling . \\nin the film\\'s most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter\\'s clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers . \\noh dear ! \\nsounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn\\'t it ? \\nthis time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : \" no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! ! \" . \\nand later , when the board of her late husband\\'s company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship , she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : \" don\\'t fuck with me , fellas ! ! \" . \\noh joy ! \\nsomething of a camp classic , then , but if that\\'s not you\\'re cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn\\'t have too much to recommend it . \\nbetter you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) . \\ngreat films distinguished by great performances , and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry\\'s shrieking piece of tabloid froth . \\n',\n"," b'a fullyloaded entertainment review : website coming soon ! \\nhunter s . thompson\\'s fear and loathing in las vegas , written in 1971 , is already an american classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960\\'s , but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as \" gonzo \" . \\nsoon after the book was written , hunter s . thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke . \\nand that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas ( the movie . ) \\nalthough the book is one of my favorites , i now agree with thompson\\'s own assessment of the novel as \" unfilmable . \" \\nthe main problem is that the book , although detailing wild drug use and tripped-out adventures , was not written on the road . \\nit was written and edited by hunter s . thomspons , relatively sober , at his home . \\nso although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use , it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor . \\nhunter s . thomspon , the narrator , while always drugged out , still has a grip on reality , and can still tell , with journalistic ability , what is going on around him . \\nnot so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas . \\ndespite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped , the movie is an exact duplicate of the book , in terms of dialouge . \\nunfortunately , this can get annoying , in the form of johnny depp\\'s ( who plays thompson ) excessive narration . \\nand the characters , while having vivid personalities , are played as 2-d characers on the screen : dr . raoul duke ( johnny depp , the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson\\'s ) and his riding companion , dr . gonzo ( benicio del toro ) , who is a large samoan lawyer , have no personalities or emotions at all , save for stoned . \\nthe film is very faithful to the plot ( what there is ) of the book , in that dr . raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400 , and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs . \\nfrom there , one set of stoned adventures after another happens , including one of the few good scenes in which depp , high on acid , watches all the people in the bar around him turn into , literally , lounge lizards . \\nwhile the movie has its moments ( few ) , it is almost unwatchable at parts , especially towards the end . \\ndespite a lot of celebrity cameos , the stars never get off the ground . \\nthe set decoration and costumes are great , and probably deserve an oscar nomination . \\nhowever , as we all know , it\\'s not sets or effects that make a movie , its the characters ; and quite frankly , these characters are no good . \\n',\n"," b'now that \" boogie nights \" has made disco respectable again ( well , fashionable at least ) , we shouldn\\'t be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era . \\nthe latest art house interpretation is whit stillman\\'s \" the last days of disco . \" \\nstillman , who made \" metropolitan \" and \" barcelona \" using some of the same actors , uses disco\\'s final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director . \\nthe young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don\\'t call them yuppies ! ) \\nmen and women of \" the last days of disco \" frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection . \\nhere they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired . \\nif talk is cheap , \" the last days of disco \" must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot . \\nwhat makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of \" the lady and the tramp \" ) . \\nna ? ve alice ( chlo ? sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house . \\ncharlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , \" like a kindergarten teacher . \" \\nthe two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot , looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms . beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! ) . \\nhere they meet , or re-meet , a variety of eligible men , many of whom they knew in college . \\ndes ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club\\'s managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back . \\ndes has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he\\'s gay . \\nwhether it\\'s true or not , it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn ) . \\ncharlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth . \\njimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who , by the end of the picture , winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of \" barcelona \" ? ) . \\njosh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say , just once , \" book this clown ! \" \\nand robert sean leonard plays another one of alice\\'s revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity . \\nany film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book . \\nin fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way . \\nwhile the eschewing of \" ferocious pairing \" is a favored topic of conversation in the film , the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the \" preferred \" dynamics of social group interaction . \\nmore mature than stillman\\'s previous two films , \" the last days of disco \" is as consistently droll as it is stimulating . \\nit\\'s a movie you should definitely get on down to . \\n',\n"," b'scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . \\nduring a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . \\na few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . \\n . \\n . \\nscream 2 ! \\n1996\\'s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! \\na sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . \\nin fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! \\nsidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . \\nmeanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled \" stab \" , which has been developed into a major motion picture . \\nas scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of \" stab \" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . \\nthis marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown \" copycat \" sets out to repeat what\\'s been done . \\n . \\n . \\nand finish what hasn\\'t ! \\nof course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . \\nthis is in large part due to williamson\\'s deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . \\nas much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you\\'re not bound to complain . \\ni will note , however , that the \" whodunit ? \" \\ndid wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . \\nall the actors outdo themselves here . \\nwe\\'re not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . \\nthe characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . \\nwe can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don\\'t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . \\nthe nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn\\'t seem off-kilter from it\\'s predecessor . \\nit\\'s a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . \\nwe skip two years , but there doesn\\'t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . \\nit flows so well that you feel more like you\\'re reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) \\nthan just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . \\nwhile main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2\\'s entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . \\nas i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it\\'s precursor . \\nthe only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . \\nthis doesn\\'t mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it\\'s sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it\\'s own while maintaining it\\'s sought-after qualities . \\nif ever a film followed it\\'s original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . \\nscream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . \\nit would top off the series quite well , if it weren\\'t for the fact that two movies don\\'t really make a series . \\nit\\'s unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won\\'t appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let\\'s hope they can keep up the fantastic work . \\nlike they say , don\\'t mess with perfection . \\n . \\n . \\nbut when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who\\'s gonna listen ? \\n',\n"," b'starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz \\npermanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this . \\nthe film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . \\n ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ) \\nultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . \\nben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit . \\nhe eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for \" alf \" : chompers looks just like alf except he\\'s blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . \\ninsert proverbial downward spiral here . \\npermanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . \\ni\\'ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i\\'ve been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . \\nas stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there\\'s something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . \\nwhat separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . \\nwatch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! \\nwatch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! \\nstiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . \\nbut permanent midnight is mostly soulless . \\nwhen the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? \\nand then answers it in the form of bello\\'s character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? \\nin the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn\\'t need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . \\nif you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it\\'s that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man . \\n ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . \\nis this hollywood . . . california ? ) \\ni learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . \\nof course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . \\nso , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he\\'s apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . \\nso much for the moral of that story . \\ntemporary midnight is more like it . \\n-bill chambers ; september , 1998 \\n',\n"," b\"you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith' . \\nit's a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on . \\nas youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio . \\nwhile their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded . \\nbut tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away . \\nnow adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs . \\nthe likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi . \\non the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad' . \\nin the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory . \\neverything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums . \\nnow a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again . \\nwith these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters . \\npredicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b . \\nedward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear' . \\nafter shockingly bitter roles in `american history x' and , most recently , david fincher's vicious `fight club' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice . \\nnot in the least . \\nnorton slips into the director's chair for the first time with `keeping the faith' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg . \\nweighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut . \\nin addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence . \\nstiller ( the zipper guy from `there's something about mary' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity . \\nelfman's perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv's `dharma and greg' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here . \\nthe remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob's animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice . \\n`keeping the faith' is the perfect date flick . . . \\nthough perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general . \\nthere is turbulence during the process of lift-off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead . \\nonce the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful . \\nstiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities . \\nwe enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true . \\nthis is excluding the ending , which is acceptable and all , but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements . \\nnonetheless , a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won't wipe the smile off your face , nor anyone else's in the audience . \\n`keeping the faith' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy , although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion . \\naww , what the hell . \\nthe quality is not quite heaven-sent , but this little charmer could revive our `faith' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre . \\n\",\n"," b\"it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar . \\nwhy ? \\nthe movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey' . \\ni got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon' . \\nbut no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster . \\nthis is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel . \\nyou have been warned . \\nof course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation . \\nbrian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off . \\nwhen he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) . \\nof course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' ) . . . . \\nall of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood . \\nthat term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient . \\nif i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole . \\nsinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration . \\nthe academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) . \\nafter a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet . \\nsuddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction . \\nfor some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art . \\nthe team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive . \\nimmediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars . \\nlet's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there . \\nit is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months . \\ni'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia . \\ninstead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship . \\nwhat happened during the five months prior to this ? \\ndid they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ? \\nstill , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak . \\ndepalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ? \\nc'mon ) . \\nthere's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud . \\nit's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists . \\nas mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . . \\nmaybe even cheated . \\nafter the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen . \\nothers muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked . ' \\nokay , it did suck . \\nbut you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . . \\nafter all , they do pretty well . \\nsinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o'connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) . \\nthe digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive . \\nso , by golly , where did this `mission' go wrong ? \\nlooking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have . \\nwhile watching `mission to mars' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don't even strap yourself in for lift-off . \\n\",\n"," b'warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . \\nbut it doesn\\'t really make much of a difference . \\ndeep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 . \\nremember when dante\\'s peak came out in february ? \\na few months later , volcano was released . \\nthe first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . \\nthe latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . \\nwell , it\\'s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . \\nthis time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . \\nof course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante\\'s peak . \\nbut while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . \\napparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . \\nto be completely honest , i haven\\'t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . \\nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . \\ndeep impact doesn\\'t just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . \\nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . \\ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . \\na line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . \\namong these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . \\nleo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . \\nhe races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . \\na year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . \\nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . \\nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . \\nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . \\nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . \\nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain \" ellie \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . \\nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . \\nbefore she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . \\nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . \\nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . \\nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . \\nand so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . \\nthey announce a plan called \" ark , \" which is their only hope for survival . \\na computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . \\nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won\\'t kill off the entire human race . \\nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . \\nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . \\njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . \\nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . \\nit\\'s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . \\nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . \\nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! \\nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won\\'t work . \\ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show \" er . \" \\nher major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . \\nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . \\nsuggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . \\nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . \\nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . \\nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it\\'s that boring . \\nof course , leder isn\\'t all to blame for it . \\nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . \\nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . \\nchock full of cheesy one liners ( \" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! \" ) \\nand stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . \\nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . \\nand the main plot is so outrageous that you can\\'t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . \\nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . \\nthat\\'s right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . \\nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . \\nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . \\nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that\\'s forgiveable . \\nwhat isn\\'t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . \\ngive me a break , will ya ? \\nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . \\nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . \\nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . \\ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . \\nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . \\njust when we think visual effects can\\'t be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . \\none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder\\'s direction , which also influences the actors . \\nleder loves to show the actors\\' faces before and during moments of terror . \\nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . \\nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . \\nleder likes to flaunt people\\'s fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . \\none moment has an astronaut flying off into space . \\nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person\\'s face while drifting into space . \\nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . \\non another note , leder\\'s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . \\nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . \\nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it\\'s obvious it will be emotional . \\nit\\'s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into \" feeling \" for the characters , but it didn\\'t work for me . \\nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . \\nt ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv\\'s \" the naked truth \" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . \\nher character is made stronger by leoni\\'s presence , and we grow to care for her . \\nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . \\nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn\\'t had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! \\nyou are too talented for this stuff ) . \\nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . \\nmaximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . \\nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . \\nleelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . \\na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . \\neldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . \\ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv\\'s \" star trek : the next generation . \" \\nseeing her was one of the highlights of the film . \\noverall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . \\ndeep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . \\nthis is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . \\nluckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . \\nit\\'s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn\\'t worth much . \\ncosting nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . \\nwell , it\\'s not . \\nwhen the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . \\n',\n"," b'when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better . \\nnice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s . \\nfor new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids . \\nfor people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for . \\nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era . \\nmartin scorsese\\'s taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all . \\nthe movie\\'s protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can\\'t sleep at nights . \\nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world . \\nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine\\'s presidential campaign . \\ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre . \\nlosing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street . \\nhe purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict . \\nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi . \\nas many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations . \\nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \\nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \\nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \\nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \\nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \\nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \\nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but doesn\\'t have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \\nwhile de niro\\'s travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \\nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america\\'s better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" . \\nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \\nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \\nmatthew \" sport \" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture . \\nporno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly \" liberated \" betsy . \\neven the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless \" messages \" that cover the lack of any serious program can\\'t fool even such idiots like travis . \\nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can\\'t be washed away even by ironic happy end . \\ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader\\'s screenplay into the silver screen . \\nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . \\nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . \\none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . \\ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . \\nnow , more than two decades later , when some other \" life imitating art \" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . \\n',\n"," b\"last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . \\nbased on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . \\nbut it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . \\nand co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . \\ni mean , what could possibly go wrong ? \\nthe answer is just about everything . \\nwild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . \\nthere are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . \\nbut the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . \\nat square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . \\nwill smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . \\nmy guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . \\nsmith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . \\nhe's too much of a joker . \\ni heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . \\nwhat makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . \\nthe plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . \\nthe trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . \\nloveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . \\none such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . \\nthe visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings . \\nunfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . \\nwild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . \\nmost of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . \\nif it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered . \\nkline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . \\nsalma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . \\nbranagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . \\nbut even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top . \\nrarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . \\ni suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint . \\nwild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . \\nbut it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . \\nperhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie . \\nafter such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume . \\n\",\n"," b'when i was nine , i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store . \\nmasters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read . \\nof course , the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history . \\ngiven the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) , it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together , come with the result of \" trillions \" and make a live-action masters movie . \\nlet\\'s be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie . \\nthe story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn\\'t * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they can\\'t help but seem terrible . \\nit is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars . \\nwe have the alien bounty hunters , the desert skif technology , stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that \" deja vu \" is too polite a term to use in describing it . \\n \" blatant uninspired ripoff \" would appear more appropriate . \\ntv fans might want to check out courtney cox ( monica in friends ) and robert duncan mcneill ( lt paris in star trek : voyager ) , very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either . \\nso in the face of such mindless sub-mediocrity , is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all ? \\nyes , there is . \\none incredible good reason . \\nhis name is frank langella . \\nlangella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood , appearing in countless films over the years . \\nhere he plays skeletor , the villain of the piece . \\ndressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face , he is one part darth vader , one part emperor and two parts grim reaper . \\ngiven this character , langella falls right into it with style and precision . \\nskeletor is believable , interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right . \\nmasters of the universe . \\ni remember loving it when i was eleven . \\nat twenty one it\\'s difficult to see why . \\nbut , as i said , it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder . \\nbesides , this year marks the film\\'s 10th anniversary . \\nwatch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate . \\n',\n"," b'i\\'m not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i\\'m not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it . \\nhowever , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i . e . \\ni didn\\'t like it . \\nif i had to summarize this film , i think i\\'d conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal . \\nthat\\'s the kernel of it , anyway . \\ntossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship . \\nunfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they\\'re simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace . \\nactually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was . \\nthey came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones . \\nthey laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it\\'s rather frightening direction . \\nthree women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town . \\none night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives . \\nin seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be . \\nhe soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power , and his devotion to the women\\'s merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones . \\neven worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him . \\nanyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon\\'s character . \\nwe never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland . \\nas for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson\\'s acting ) , he still can\\'t be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague . \\nand then there\\'s the special effects . \\nnot in themselves--they weren\\'t that good--but their overuse . \\ni was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson-blown-down-the-street stunt . \\nnope , it\\'s another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts/special effects before ( the road warrior , \" nightmare at 20 , 00 feet \" episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn\\'t know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act . \\nf\\'gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson ! \\nlet him loose ! \\nlet him grin demonically ! \\nskip the splitting earth and fake lightning ! \\nwatching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , \" what a waste \" . \\nif you\\'re going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman . \\nnicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he\\'s not sure what he should be doing next . \\nand no wonder . \\nthis script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it\\'d just love to be allegory , but it\\'s not sure about what-- maybe if you give it time it\\'ll think of something . \\nso what is the witches of eastwick ? \\na horror movie ? \\na folk tale ? \\na comedy ? \\na statement about women ? \\nan examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ? \\ni tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching \\nsomeone regurgitate half-digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience . \\nin other words , a mess . \\n ( $2 . 00 ) \\nif you like nicholson enough to watch him here ; maybe 25% of his charm is able to make it through the logjams of others . \\n',\n"," b'here\\'s a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler\\'s list is to jurassic park . \\nin 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler\\'s list as the director\\'s \" penance \" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) . \\nnow , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance . \\nonce again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . \\nnow , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity . \\nthat film is amistad . \\nalthough not as masterful as schindler\\'s list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . \\nthematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . \\nwatching schindler\\'s list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . \\nspielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later . \\naspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . \\namistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . \\nthe incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that\\'s not a surprise . \\nhowever , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order . \\nseveral , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film\\'s dramatic force . \\non the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . \\none stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape . \\nled by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew . \\nadrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . \\nthey are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states\\' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut . \\nthe kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy . \\nthe first men to come to the africans\\' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) . \\nthey are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute . \\naided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge . \\nbut powerful forces have aligned against baldwin\\'s cause . \\ncurrent president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free . \\nat its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . \\ncinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to . \\nhe is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up . \\neffectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . \\nthey are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie\\'s success . \\nto amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans\\' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man\\'s seemingly-strange \" rituals \" . \\nthe larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity . \\nas the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as \" sub-human , \" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense . \\nthe abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . \\nin a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything . \\namistad\\'s presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . \\nfour claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them . \\nbaldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque . \\neven though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate . \\naside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch . \\nmatthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his \" pretty boy \" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . \\nlikewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than \" abolitionists . \" \\nnigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . \\nfinally , there\\'s anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . \\nhopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . \\nhis ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable . \\none point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler\\'s list is this film\\'s lack of a well-defined human villain . \\nschindler\\'s list had ralph fiennes\\' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . \\nthere is no such figure in amistad . \\nthe villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . \\nit is to spielberg\\'s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . \\namistad\\'s trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . \\nan opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 . \\nnumerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . \\nit remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg\\'s rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history . \\n',\n"," b\"the happy bastard's quick movie review \\nholy man \\nmore like holy crap . \\nthe film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands . \\nsomehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures . \\nit's here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales . \\nat this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) . \\nit doesn't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush , with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points . \\nonly a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild's face seems to have any interest in the movie . \\nmurphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he'd rather be someplace else . \\nsome may argue that the movie has a message , but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat . \\nat least he has something for us to laught at . . . \\n\",\n"," b'under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . \\nhowever , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary . \\neven though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk . \\nthe movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm\\'s past patients . \\ndistraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself . \\ncut to the \" next fall \" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn\\'t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) . \\nafter about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has \" the sixth sense \" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead . \\nand this , as they say , is where the healing begins . \\nthe sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert\\'s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of \" siskel and ebert \" ) . \\nalthough i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i\\'ve always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one . \\nhere , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film\\'s conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i\\'ve fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated . \\nand indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment . \\nstripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion . \\nafter seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power . \\nit\\'s a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie . \\nin fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come . \\nand when the final moments do come , it\\'s a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all . \\nit stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level . \\ni won\\'t go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder . \\nnow , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand . \\nhowever , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few \" twilight zone \" episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away . \\nthe fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped . \\nironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl\\'s funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy . \\ni wouldn\\'t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn\\'t , by pure dumb luck , caught \" dateline nbc \" the other week when they did a feature story on it . \\ndespite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn\\'t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation . \\n',\n"," b'seen at : amc old pasadena 8 , pasadena , ca ( in sdds ) \\npaul verhoeven\\'s last movie , showgirls , had a bad script , bad acting , and a \" plot \" ( i use the word in its loosest possible sense ) that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity . \\nit stank . \\nstarship troopers has a bad script , bad acting , and a \" plot \" that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore . \\nit stinks . \\nnobody will watch this movie for the plot , but here\\'s a brief synopsis anyway . \\nsome friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve ( armed forces ) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy . \\nafter one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires ( the home city of the main characters ) , war is declared . \\nthis involves sending the grunts , who include johnny rico ( van dien ) and dizzy ( meyer ) , down to the surface of the bugs\\' planet . \\nmuch carnage ensues . \\nthe troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call . \\nmore carnage ensues . \\nafter being rescued , their plans are changed to capture a \" brain bug \" which is believed to be controlling the aliens\\' battle plans ( look , i didn\\'t write this , ok ? ) . \\nyet more carnage ensues . \\nget the picture ? \\ninterspersed throughout all this are brief \" ads \" from the federal network , which present the picture of a neo-fascist state , much like in verhoeven\\'s robocop . \\nthere are many problems with starship troopers . \\nthe plot , where one exists to drive the movie onwards , is silly . \\nharris ( star of tv\\'s doogie howser , md ) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie , apparently so we will accept his ability to mind-meld with a \" brain bug \" later on . \\nin addition , the first thirty minutes of the movie ( until the characters sign up for service ) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills , 90210 . \\nthe characters are one-dimensional , so much so , that when dizzy is killed , she says it\\'s ok because she got to sleep with rico . \\ni had hoped that verhoeven\\'s use of a no-name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience , but such an idea appears to have escaped him . \\nthe dialogue is embarassing and isn\\'t helped by the frequently terrible delivery ( i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species ) . \\nfinally , the fake \" ads \" become a nuisance . \\nalthough they evoke the propaganda of the wwii-era movietone reels ( as presumably they are meant to ) , their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect . \\nsome people will say all of that\\'s irrelevant -- the movie hinges on the battle scenes . \\nso what about those battle scenes ? \\nwell , i admit the effects are good -- the bugs move about quite convincingly , especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs . \\nand people have their brains blown out , their limbs cut off , and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways . \\nbut this is my problem . \\nthe entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore , and its continous attempt to gross us out ( starting early on when richards\\' character vomits on-screen ) . \\nverhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success , but fails spectacularly . \\nwhile robocop had a message about the importance of being human , and gave the bad guys some motivation , starship troopers lacks even these simple features . \\nwhen the brain bug sucks out a character\\'s brain near the end of the film , it\\'s merely an analogy for what the film has done to us . \\nthis film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16 . \\n',\n"," b' \" meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood ! , \" \\nscreams the television ads for \" hanging up , \" disastrously written by real-life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton . \\nmake me laugh again ! \\nnot only is \" hanging up \" misadvertised , since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co-stars , lisa kudrow and diane keaton , little more than extended cameos , but they don\\'t actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes . \\nand we are supposed to believe their strong bond , and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship , despite them being apart for the majority of the running time ? \\nexcuse me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion . \\neve marks ( meg ryan ) is the middle mozzell sister , still living in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre-teen son ( jesse james ) . \\nher elderly , wisecracking father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest performance in years ) has just recently been put into the hospital , in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer\\'s ( even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him ) . \\nwhile eve\\'s relationship with her mother ( cloris leachman ) is nearly nonexistent , since she ran out on lou and her children years ago , she has had her fair share of up\\'s and down\\'s with lou , who used to be an alcoholic . \\nher older sister is georgia ( diane keaton ) , an editor for the self-titled magazine , \" georgia , \" while maddy ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress . \\ninterestingly , their professions are given , but we not once ever see them working at their jobs , or , for that matter , learn much of anything about them . \\nmaddy , georgia , and eve do not see each other much anymore , their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart , but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another . \\nand they talk . \\nand talk . \\nand talk . . . \\nin fact , the telephone is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long . \\nif you are able to get through the opening half-hour , in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them , you will surely survive the rest . \\nthe question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self-involved pat-on-the-back ? \\nhow could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? \\nissues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn\\'t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought . \\nalso , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes . \\nand when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children . \\nyou can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other . \\nyou think to yourself : \" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight , \" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits . \\nmeg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998\\'s \" hurlyburly \" or 1994\\'s \" when a man loves a woman \" ) , despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies . \\nwith \" hanging up , \" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn\\'t be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle . \\neven if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son\\'s birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations . \\ndiane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment . \\nwhat is more than a little far-fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five years ryan\\'s senior . \\nyeah , right . \\nlastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999\\'s \" analyze this . \" \\nkudrow isn\\'t given enough time to create a full personality with maddy , so it isn\\'t her fault she doesn\\'t register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue . \\nif anything , though , kudrow is a real talent , and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time , as in her brilliantly nuanced , oscar-caliber work in 1998\\'s \" the opposite of sex . \" \\nif you are a fan of kudrow\\'s ( and who isn\\'t ? ) , do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than \" hanging up \" does in its entirety . \\nas eve\\'s hardworking husband , adam arkin is , predictably , squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do , until a subplot reveals itself midway through , only to never be mentioned again . \\ncloris leachman , as with ryan and matthau , makes a small , but noticeable impression with her , albeit , very brief appearance , while edie mcclurg , as a rosy-cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback , manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production . \\nnearly all the emotions displayed within \" hanging up \" are patently manufactured , and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters , aside from eve , why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats ? \\nif , for some bizarre , \" twilight zone \" -type of reason , you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film , my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over . \\nsaying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions . \\n',\n"," b\"at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . \\nbasically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . \\nhow ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . \\nswordfish is loud , violent and amoral . \\nit has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . \\nand how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? \\nby robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . \\nswordfish is a very cynical movie . \\nit relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . \\nthe movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . \\nthis is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . \\nthe storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . \\ntalk about whacked-out patriotism . \\nmy objections to swordfish are many . \\nthe body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . \\nit's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . \\nanother example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife . \\nstanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . \\naudience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films . \\nthus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . \\nin fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . \\nthen there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . \\nchildren as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . \\nthere is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well . \\nyea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it . \\ntravolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel . \\nhis character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off . \\njackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . \\nhis only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . \\nhis sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . \\nhalle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . \\nswordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel . \\nviewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . \\nand maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . \\nand that is not enough . \\nthis is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water . \\n\",\n"," b'yeah , yeah , the advertisements didn\\'t even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex . \\nneve campbell and starship trooper\\'s denise richards getting it on ? \\nok ! \\nyeah , it\\'s a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that\\'s your main interest in this film , there\\'s plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes . \\nwild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however . \\nnearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie . \\nbut this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events doesn\\'t leave much time to enjoy the surprises . \\nwe start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making . \\nguidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts . \\nright off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce \" mr . lombardo \" . \\nthe fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor\\'s jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you\\'ll be soaked from head to toe when you\\'re done . \\non the weekend of the car wash , kelly\\'s attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day . \\nnaturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations . \\nbut the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor . \\npitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray . \\nyes , that bill murray ! \\nsound like a good , complete movie ? \\nyes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning . \\nin fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film . \\nit is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time . \\nby the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable . \\nunfortunately , with so much going on , you\\'re not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about . \\nthis is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could\\'ve been . \\nthe 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could\\'ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken . \\nthe acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing . \\nand it\\'s not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap \" party of five \" , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones . \\ndillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year\\'s in & out , gives the best performance , and murray\\'s surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film . \\nin fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade . \\nthat\\'s how cheezy it comes off . \\nbut aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full\\'s . \\nin the right hands , wild things could\\'ve been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting . \\nand what\\'s up with these people passing as high school students ? \\ni realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it wasn\\'t supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker . \\ni won\\'t lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure . \\nas corny as it is , it\\'s got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a \" b \" for effort . \\nbut if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year\\'s starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better . \\nof course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you\\'ll be right at home with wild things . \\nperhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters . \\n',\n"," b'bob the happy bastard\\'s quickie review : \\nthe mummy \\nbrendan fraser\\'s stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . \\nfraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) . \\nit\\'s a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in . \\nbut who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can\\'t get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon . \\nfraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground . \\nbasically , it\\'s a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress . \\nhis plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible . \\nof course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising\\'s kevin j . o\\'connor ) and some \" americans \" . . . and \\nguess what ? \\nyup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . \\nfire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep\\'s plan begins to unfold . \\nok , so it\\'s not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . \\nthe special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn\\'t half bad either . \\nthe action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . \\nno , it\\'s no phantom menace beater , but if you\\'re looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won\\'t find a better film under wraps than the mummy . \\nif this doesn\\'t give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will . \\n',\n"," b'because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy ! \\nat last , both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources ! \\nthe choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot , which could be fodder for a valentine\\'s day episode of \" the x-files . \" \\nbob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident . \\nat the same time , grace briggs ( minnie driver ) is in the hospital , waiting for a heart transplant . \\ngrace gets elizabeth\\'s heart , and it leads her to bob . \\nit\\'s the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people . \\nfour writers are credited with contributing to the story . \\nthat doesn\\'t seem possible . \\ndespite being a solid two hours long , \" return to me \" adds little to the \" boy meets girl / boy loses girl \" formula and , as a result , is terribly tedious and slow-moving . \\nduchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks , and i kept wishing for a fast-forward button to move their scenes along . \\nsince driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before , i blame duchovny . \\nhe\\'s out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series ( and i\\'ve always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on \" the x-files \" comes off more sibling-like than hot-and-bothered ) . \\nthere\\'s something about duchovny that makes me uneasy . \\nregardless of the role he\\'s playing , he comes off as a weirdo . \\nthe only redeeming quality of \" return to me \" is its hilarious supporting cast . \\nthe circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker , and they generate the only laughs in the movie . \\ncarroll o\\'connor is grace\\'s grandfather marty o\\'reilly . \\nwhen bob comes into marty\\'s restaurant after hours , marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status . \\nwhen marty discovers that bob is a widower , he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration , \" this is bob ! \\nhis wife is dead ! \" \\nthe poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news . \\nalso funny : bonnie hunt as grace\\'s best friend megan and james belushi as megan\\'s husband joe . \\nmarried with children , megan and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance . \\nalthough it\\'s rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater , belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill . \\nrounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob\\'s best friend and robert loggia as marty\\'s brother-in-law angelo . \\nin only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast . \\nbottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie , watch it on video so you can fast-forward to scenes with carroll o\\'connor and james belushi . \\n',\n"," b\"one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable . \\nyou know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is . \\nsure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch . \\nthis cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun . \\none of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story . \\nthis rule applies highly to kiss the girls . \\nthere is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made . \\nhowever , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through . \\nwell , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up . \\nunfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits . \\nthat may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery . \\nhowever , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film . \\nplotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality . \\nwe are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero . \\nhe gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself . \\nobviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene . \\nat his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days . \\nthis provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross . \\nhowever , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . . \\nbefore she is abducted . \\ndr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself . \\nbecause of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful . \\nafter being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods . \\nremembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out . \\nwhen casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall . \\nafter she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice . \\nfrom this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive . \\nmany people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional . \\nthe screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form . \\nwhat makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness . \\nthe cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us . \\nsometimes a simple shot is the best one . \\nhowever , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight . \\nthe scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way . \\nthe camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well . \\nthe chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing . \\nhowever , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors . \\nmorgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors . \\ndetective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven . \\nbecause of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself . \\nthe other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses . \\nin fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible . \\nher character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully . \\nwe finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream . \\nthe supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it . \\ncary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character . \\ntony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either . \\ngina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes . \\nso as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job . \\nsome of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year . \\ntwo other essential aspects of the film are quite good . \\ndirector gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer . \\nhe also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes . \\nhowever , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half . \\npart of the blame falls on david klass . \\ni'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts . \\nwhile this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible . \\nthanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent . \\nnone of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced . \\none of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer . \\ni blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) . \\nkiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex . \\nwith all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain . \\nin fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances . \\nthe cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart . \\nthis is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through . \\nmorgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt . \\ni must also say that i loved the ending . \\nthe showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer . \\nperhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn't anyway . \\n\",\n"," b'i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again . \\nand everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you\\'re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) . \\nthis remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite . \\ncontemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they\\'re usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 . \\nthis one , however , is shockingly not bad . \\nin fact , it\\'s actually good . \\nnot the original good , but what\\'s great about it is that it doesn\\'t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining . \\nbecause it\\'s cute and innocent fun . \\nbecause it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with . \\nbecause the lead star is immensely appealing . \\nbecause the parents are also immensely appealing . \\nand ( i\\'m repeating myself ) because it\\'s cute and innocent fun . \\nthere\\'s nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it\\'s aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid . \\ni , personally , am somewhere between the second and third . \\ni can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn\\'t so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren\\'t even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc\\'s \" wonderful world of disney , \" where they\\'d show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week . \\ni can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like \" lady and the tramp \" and \" pinnochio \" ) . \\nand , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children\\'s animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn\\'t dare missing . \\ni can even remember seeing the made-for-tv \" parent trap ii \" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original \" parent trap . \" \\nit\\'s more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version . \\nit\\'s playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i\\'d probably dismiss it . \\ni\\'d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn\\'t seen the original at such a perfect age . \\nwatching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence . \\nand also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better . \\nthis new version did that for me , but it\\'s also charming in its own way . \\nit has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn\\'t corny or condescending , but just right . \\nthe moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way . \\nand for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults . \\nthe story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa\\'s \" the seven samurai \" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents . \\none , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin\\' fashion designer . \\nshe grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing . \\nthe other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming . \\nthey both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged . \\nthey feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin . \\nthere , they become friends , then learn about eachother . \\nonce they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they\\'ve only heard of . \\nthey learn about eachother\\'s lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in \" pulp fiction \" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best . \\nlindsay lohan doesn\\'t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original . \\nbut she comes off just as appealing as she did once . \\nshe does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively . \\nshe also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones\\' accents aren\\'t exactly perfect . \\nshe\\'s also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films . \\nshe makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing . \\ndennis quaid , in fact , hasn\\'t been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he\\'s mr . meg ryan . \\nditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn\\'t ever been this likable period ) . \\nthe two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o\\'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film . \\ninstead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film\\'s more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films . \\nthis all brings this new \" parent trap \" to a level of entertainment that hasn\\'t really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time . \\nthis is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who\\'s deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore . \\nlike the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : \" it takes two \" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around . \\nand because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew . \\nhowever , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better . \\ncertain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original . \\ni liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear . \\nand as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom . \\nthe original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences . \\nas such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances . \\n',\n"," b\"woody allen is one of the most successful artist-directors in hollywood , but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker . \\nin his early years of film-making he mastered the simple comedy . \\nfrom there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles . \\nsome of these work better than others . \\nzelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist . \\ndeconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back . \\nharry block ( allen ) has in his life only two drives . \\nhe wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing . \\nthe story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments . \\nperhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry's life by editing harry's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out . \\nas a writer , harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises . \\nthe film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry's books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry's life . \\nthese fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion , but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters . \\nit is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person . \\nif that sounds complicated , it is . \\nthen as another device in one of the stories , an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image . \\nharry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time . \\nas if these touches did not create sufficient confusion , the story is told out of chronological order . \\nif allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding , any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable . \\nbut allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand . \\ndeconstructing harry is set at a time when harry's old college , the one that expelled him when he attended it , wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement . \\nharry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him . \\njust why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear . \\nharry tries his current girl friend fay ( elizabeth shue ) only to find that she is about to marry harry's old friend larry ( billy crystal ) . \\nblock would like his son hilly ( eric lloyd ) to accompany him , but hilly's mother , previously first harry's psychiatrist and more recently his wife , refuses to let her son see his father . \\nanother friend richard ( bob balaban ) would go but has health problems . \\nharry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie ( hazel goodman ) . \\nit is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite , but cookie is considerably different--black and a lot brighter than mira sorvino's character in the previous film . \\nwhile the comedy sequences are never complete , a few are elaborate and some quite funny . \\nthe centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil , who looks a lot like larry . \\nthat story also is left uncompleted , perhaps to show harry's unwillingness to commit even to telling a story . \\nthe linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care . \\nthat character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes . \\nallen can do much better than deconstructing harry . \\ni rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n\",\n"," b'yet another brainless teen flick , this one is about , surprise , drugs and sex . \\nstars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn\\'t look more bored . \\ntheir characters are cardboard cut-outs of every cliched teenager out there . \\none thing you need to know is i really hated this movie . \\neverything about it annoyed the hell out of me . \\nthe acting , and script , the plot , and ending . \\nthe director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no-name actors and had a watchabe film . \\nthe \" big \" stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality . \\ni felt like i was watching dawson\\'s creek episode 200 . \\nalthough the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast . \\nthe \" surprise \" ending was sooo predictable . \\nsince when is a male character\\'s sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ? \\ngo is dawson\\'s creek + varsity blues - she\\'s all that = go home and watch something else . \\n',\n"," b'as bad as \" mimic \" was , it definitly scared me . \\n \" mimic \" continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie . \\ndirector guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film \" cronos . \" \\nthat movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie . \\nin \" mimic \" , del toro doesn\\'t bother to give us anything original . \\nthe plot is a stupid combination of \" aliens \" meets \" species \" meets \" jurassic park . \" \\nthe characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies . \\nthere\\'s nothing new in \" mimic \" . \\nit\\'s just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work . \\nat the end of the movie , you\\'re stuck wanting your money back . \\nmaybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on . \\ni don\\'t understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the \" seven \" trend and be set in dark , dank areas . \\nwatching \" mimic \" i was tempted several times to yell at the screen \" turn the lights on ! \\nthe switch is to your right ! \\nuse common sense ! \\njust do it ! \\nyou\\'ll be able to see the monster in the corner ! \" \\nthere\\'s a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off . \\nit looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn\\'t even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts . \\n \" hmmm . . . . \\ni think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight . \" \\n \" mimic \" has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo ! \\njust kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you . \\nthe audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too . \\ni shouldn\\'t blame del toro . \\nhe isn\\'t the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie . \\nhong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , \" the killer \" and \" hard boiled \" then came to america to make the stupid \" broken arrow . \" \\nfrench directors luc besson ( \" la femme nikita \" ) and george sluizer ( \" the vanishing \" ) followed woo\\'s lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies . \\nrobert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget \" el mariachi \" came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high-budget \" desperado . \" \\ni don\\'t know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can\\'t make a good american movie . \\nwoo finally broke through and made \" face/off \" , but it still isn\\'t up to par with his earlier films . \\ni get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , \" welcome to america ! \\ni bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long . \\ndo you speak english ? \\nnow , i know you think you\\'ve made good movies in the past , but now you\\'re in america , so things are a little different here . \\njust remember what the american audience always wants , and you\\'ll be fine . \\nthey want to see at least one big breasted woman , characters that they\\'ve seen a thousand times before ( because change scares americans ) , and you always need a cheesy feel-good ending to wrap things up . \\nif you don\\'t make

string of old-sitcoms-to-movie conversion fever . \\nremember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back ? \\n ( brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped ) . \\ni do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy , but the tv-conversion-movies are hitting our screens like wildfire , sad to say , with mixed success . \\nsuch movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following , the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie . \\nsgt . \\nbilko ( frankly , i have not seen any its original tv version ) , even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd ; failed to entertain . \\nsgt . ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool ( place of vehicle storage and repair ) of fort baxter . \\nthough totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of , he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money-making opportunities ; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4-d pools . \\nthough materialistic in mind , bilko's methods has thoughtfully `enriched' the lives of the men of fort baxter , providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that . \\ncolonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully-confused' state , bilko has managed to hide his operation , though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it . \\nbilko's state of ascent is suddenly under-fire when the pentagon sends major thorn , a tough cookie on army regulations , to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project , a new weapon under development within the fort's grounds . \\nto add to his problems , thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major `sabo' done on him by bilko during their younger army days . \\ndirector jonathan lynn , who directed my cousin vinny ( in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best-supporting actress ) managed to pull sgt . \\nbilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter , but that is about it . \\nthere are really not enough laughter-packed-moments in sgt . \\nbilko to fully entertain the average movie-goer . \\nstill , steve martin's sgt . \\nbilko is played with finesse and full-force by the renowned comedian . \\nwithout him , sgt . \\nbilko would have just fell flat on its face . \\nsgt . \\nbilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world . \\nthe current trend in mixed successes in such tv-conversions may be a blessing in disguise , really ; at least it will force hollywood to re-think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv-idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity . \\nunless you are a fan of the tv-series or love to watch steve martin in action , you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres . \\ni'm sure there are better ones around . \\n\",\n"," b\"well , as i check my score card for what i've done this holiday weekend , it reads good ideas : 0 and dumb ideas : 1 . \\ni don't know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie . \\nbut in my defense , i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him . \\nthe film that i'm talking about is `a night at the roxbury , ' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit . \\nwayne and garth , these two are not . \\nrather , we meet doug and steve butabi ( the actors' names are not worth mentioning ) , two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city , the roxbury . \\ndriving in their dad's bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice , they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club . \\n`have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt , ' they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change . \\ntheir second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick-up lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl ( `let me see that label . \\njust as i thought - made in heaven , ' says one of the brothers ) . \\nand , like the losers that they are , they fail to do either for much of the film . \\nhowever , as fate would have it , an accidental meeting with `what-ever-happened-to' richard grieco gives them the all-important ticket to get in . \\ntheir sad lives take on a whole new direction . \\nthey make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene . \\nand they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women . \\nbut their newfound popularity does not impress their father , who has other plans for them . \\nthe unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one-joke movie , and the brothers are the joke . \\nactually , there's about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff . \\nalas , too long for tv and way too short for a feature-length film . \\nthus , there just isn't enough material to sustain the 83-minute movie . \\nthere's no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway's europop song , what is love . \\ni was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash . \\nto take up more film time , there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug . \\nthis creates not only friction between the brothers , but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well . \\nshe's educated and a forebearing witch . \\nmeanwhile , doug is a complete loser . \\nhow did these two ever get together ? \\ni suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question , i'll have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie . \\nif you're looking for entertainment , you won't find it at the roxbury . \\n\",\n"," b'plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes . \\nthis film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century-old mystery . \\ncritique : awesome ! \\ni love dark movies , i love stylish movies , i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp . . . so \\nyes , i really dug this movie ! \\nthe hughes brothers are back with a vengeance , out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously , and this movie , my friends . . . is \\nvery serious ! \\nin fact , it\\'s also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell . \\nit ain\\'t for the kids , i\\'ll tell you that much . \\nand if any of those recent hack directors of two-bit scream-esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective \" kill scenes \" , do not look any further , because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner , especially when compared to their generic slice-and-dice contrivances . \\nin fact , most of this film\\'s structure is very creative , the actors , all solid , the atmosphere and \" feel \" of the picture , remarkably real ( gotta love those \" unfortunates \" ) , and the descent into darkness , well honed by the filmmakers . \\nyou can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time . \\nbut it\\'s also an impressive mystery film , based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered . \\nthe theory in this film is based on the graphic novel \" from hell \" written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone-ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ? \\nyes , the brothers even managed to slip a little \" love \" story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could\\'ve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already . \\nthat\\'s right , there\\'s no real need to put any \" romance \" in a film about a mass murderer ! \\nbut that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through . \\nsure , he\\'s just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one . \\ni was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp\\'s character had to do with the film\\'s development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn\\'t ) . \\non the downside , the film doesn\\'t really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development . \\nbut then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement . \\ni mean , the less i knew about each person , the more suspicious i became of each one\\'s motives , reasons , etc . . . \\nin fact , i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end , and that was in part , due to the distance to which i\\'d been held from the film\\'s characters . . . or \\nam i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ? \\nperhaps . \\noverall , this is an extremely creepy production , with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppola\\'s dracula and burton\\'s sleepy hollow ) , a grim score and solid acting . \\nbut it\\'s not for everyone . \\nsome may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events , and even though the murders aren\\'t shown as graphically as you might think , there\\'s enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors . \\nbut i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable , gothic atmosphere , and this flick is just that and plenty more ! \\nand god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper\\'s haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon . . . brrrrr ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nthe crow ( 9/10 ) - dark city ( 9/10 ) - dracula ( 7/10 ) - jfk ( 9/10 ) - the nightmare before christmas ( 10/10 ) - the ninth

1995 , with \" in the mouth of madness . \" \\nbut something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , \" memoirs of an invisible man . \" \\nsomehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , \" village of the damned , \" to his uninspired 1996 sequel , \" escape from l . a . \" those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , \" john carpenter\\'s vampires . \" \\nif i was him , i definately wouldn\\'t want to put my own name in the title . \\nit is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , \" vampires . \" \\nthe story is simple . \\njack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) . \\nsince katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her . \\nit seems valek\\'s mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him . \\nmy question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ? \\nwell , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made . \\n \" john carpenter\\'s vampires , \" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i\\'ve ever seen . \\nin fact , there isn\\'t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time . \\nthe non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter\\'s . \\nand then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent . \\nthere is no story development , and there isn\\'t even an attempt to flesh out the characters . \\njames woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of \" pseudo \" -clever lines of dialogue . \\ndaniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense . \\nand sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in \" twin peaks \" ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore . \\nthere is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , \" john carpenter\\'s vamires , \" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter\\'s . \\nhe has said that he turned down directing , \" halloween : h20 , \" because he couldn\\'t work up any excitement for it . \\nand yet , when asked about a \" vampires \" sequel , he said he would be happy to do it . \\ni think that\\'s a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points . \\n',\n"," b'usually when a blockbuster comes out , it\\'s loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \\nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \\nthe film is based upon the comic book series \" the flaming carrot \" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \\nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \\nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \\nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \\nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \\n \" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \\nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \\nthat is until they aquire \" invisible boy \" ( kel mitchell ) , and \" the bowler \" ( janeane garafalo ) and \" mr . splein \" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \\nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \\nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \\nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \\nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \\na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \\nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \\nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \\none was paul reuben . \\nno matter how disgusting or revolting \" mr . splein \" may be , you still can\\'t help but laugh . \\nit\\' so incredibly moronic , it\\'s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \\njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \\nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \\nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \\non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \\nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \\ntheir parts were so limited , they\\'d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \\nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \\nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \\nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \\nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i\\'m glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \\nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \\nit forgets about money making , because it\\'s not likely to make a bundle like it\\'s proceeders , and that\\'s what works . \\nstupid ? \\nmaybe , but for once i\\'m not disappointed . \\nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \\n',\n"," b'actually , i\\'m fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie . \\n \" baywatch \" babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d\\'s on the small screen . \\nat least there you don\\'t have to pay to see her cleavage . \\nand for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire . \\nyou wouldn\\'t be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in . \\ni can\\'t go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there . \\nthey do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it\\'s so quick you can\\'t even tell for sure whether you\\'re seeing her andersons or not . \\na nipple hallucination sort of thing . \\nbarb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions . \\nyes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one . \\nshe is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience . \\nyou\\'d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn\\'t have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it\\'s obvious she wasn\\'t pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills . \\ni mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler\\'s convention . \\nthe movie is set in the year 2017 , \" the worst year of my life , \" pam says . \\n ( \" the worst movie of the year , \" i say . ) \\namerica is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think ) . \\nshe also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute . \\nbut don\\'t call her \" babe . \" \\nshe hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times . \\nimagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term . \\na liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn\\'t have to hear words like \" babe \" during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success . \\nthe plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate\\'s retina scanners . \\nin the words of one of the characters , they\\'re \" more than meets the eye . \" \\nreminds me of the \" transformers \" cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened . \\nno , the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme , big-busted kickboxer , and her resistance accomplices , ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell ) . \\nthank god they didn\\'t name her cora reef . \\none bad character name is more than enough . \\npamela originally doesn\\'t take sides , giving some speech about she\\'s only loyal to the money they pay her , but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother , jack noseworthy of bon jovi \" always \" video fame . \\ni still don\\'t know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy , but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he isn\\'t sponge worthy ) . \\npam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest . \\nit\\'s not rambo . . . \\nit\\'s bimbo ! \\nmark my words , barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year . \\nit\\'s got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo\\'s bastard cousin , the cable channel i\\'d never watch if it didn\\'t somehow come free . \\nit\\'s got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism , laughable flashbacks , bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo . \\nthere\\'s even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie\\'s premise while the words scroll up the screen . \\nsomeone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain\\'t star wars . \\nif you\\'ve seen any action flick of the past fifteen years , you\\'ll recognize plenty of lifted elements . \\nbarb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over , car crashes , explosions , broken glass and slow-motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death . \\nthis is one of those automatic-pilot movies anyone could write or direct . \\nbarb wire has only two things going for it . . . \\nand i think you know what those two things are . \\n',\n"," b' \" you damn dirty apes ! \" \\nthat\\'s just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes that\\'s taken on a comedic context over time . \\nno one back then seemed to realize how over-the- top charlton heston\\'s acting style was , but it shows now , particularly in this \" mystery science theater 3000 \" wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time , actually winning one oscar ( for makeup , no less ) and being nominated for a couple others . \\nit also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes , escape from the planet of the apes , return of the planet of the apes , beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes , planet of the apes : the next generation , police academy of the apes . . . \\nthe list goes on . \\nheston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth . \\nthe thing is , on this planet humans can\\'t talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species . \\nheston\\'s companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned . \\nhe surprises them all with his gift of speech , making two primate scientists ( roddy mcdowall and kim hunter ) believe heston is the missing link between ape and man . \\nbelieve me , we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years . \\nwhen the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel ( the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans ) , it is received as heresy , for all good monkeys know god \" created ape in his image . \" \\nbut heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species , before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president . \\nand he takes them there , holding up a baby doll and yelling , \" if humans couldn\\'t speak , then how do you account for this talking doll ? ! \" \\nand how do you account for your acting ability , mr . heston ? \\nthe absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie\\'s surprise conclusion . \\ni won\\'t reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling \" god damn you all to hell ! \" \\nseveral times in succession . \\nthe movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them . \\nwhat makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony , a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution . \\nbut let me tell you , if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges ( heston [to female ape] : may i kiss you before i go ? \\nape : but . . . \\nyou\\'re so . . . \\nugly . ) , he\\'d convert to creationism on the spot . \\nluckily for us , science-fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good . \\n',\n"," b\"this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash . \\nthis is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life . \\nyes , there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department . \\nit shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives . \\nand how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty . \\nalthough in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way . \\nthis becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there . \\nthe characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money . \\nthey should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance . \\ncommendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful . \\nbill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems . \\nfill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath . \\nit's not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you're the menendez brothers . \\n\",\n"," b'it seems like i\\'m reviewing cheeseball horror movies on a monthly basis now . \\nscream revitalized a genre the studios are now intent on burying into the ground again-the serial killers in these new slasher movies have nothing on sony and miramax in the \" relentless \" department . \\ni still know what you did last summer is a terrible film in many respects , but in the wake of the stupefyingly bad urban legend , it\\'s citizen hook . \\njennifer love-hewitt reprises her role as buxom teenager julie james-who apparently escaped certain doom at the end of the last movie by . . . waking \\nup . \\nshe lives in fear of ben willis , the vengeful fisherman-victim of a hit and run by julie and her pals . \\nparanoid and beat , she accepts a free trip to the bahamas from her friend karla ( norwood ) , winner of the local radio station\\'s 4th of july getaway giveaway . \\nbikini-ready julie invites boyfriend ray ( prinze , jr . ) , who-and here\\'s the movie\\'s biggest mystery-turns her down , but changes his mind and plans to surprise her before take-off . \\nuntil he gets a roadside visit from captain hell-liner himself , that is . \\nunaware of this and feeling shunned , julie goes on vacation , anyway , with karla , karla\\'s boyfriend ( pfeiffer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , a real boy-next-door type who\\'s sweet on julie . \\nto make a long story short-i can\\'t believe it took a paragraph to describe the set-up for this gratuitous sequel-the trip is a disaster . \\nnot only is it storm season , not only is the desk clerk ( the frighteners\\' jeffrey combs ) a jerk , not only are the few island residents and our heroic vacationers getting picked off by the resourceful willis one-by-one , but the karaoke machine isn\\'t working properly ! \\n ( you think killing is hard ? \\ntry reprogramming a laserdisc so that gloria gaynor\\'s \" i will survive \" now contains the lyric \" i still know what you did last summer ! \" ) \\nall is not lost-ray is on his way to save the day , and a helpful witch doctor is saying little prayers for julie and co . \\nthis picture is really about breasts : two of them . \\njulie , like a good horror heroine , never does up her shirt to the collar , always wears white in the rain , and keeps sexy underwear on in case of a sudden desire to tan . \\nbased on the hormonal charge i got out of the movie , i can\\'t imagine what it was doing to the ten year old boy who sat next to me-he gets jennifer love-hewitt , and my generation got heather langenkamp ! \\nlucky bastard . \\ni didn\\'t like i know what you did last summer and i can\\'t say i liked this continuation any more or less . \\nthe pacing in both films is languid-how is it that so much time passes with neither murder nor character development ? \\ni still know what you did last summer has a better sense of humour than the first one , though , and at least it explains away willis\\'s random selection of victims . \\n ( i don\\'t think the hotel maid or the stoner dude had the slightest idea what julie did last summer . ) \\ndirector cannon ( judge dredd ) is a competent filmmaker but not a particularly imaginative one-if there is a part three ( what on earth would they call it ? ) , and the fun denouement suggests there will be , here\\'s my suggestion : hire a filmmaker with flair , someone who can really energize this stillborn series-someone who won\\'t rely on so many shock notes . \\nand let that person run wild with the camera . \\n ( aside : if blandy [sic] must appear in the next one , try to keep the number of times she says \" baby \" to a minimum . \\nthanks in advance . ) \\n',\n"," b\"john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it's good side and it's bad . \\nit's held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that's pretty satisfying . \\njames woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie . \\nthe good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence . \\nthe bad : no scares . \\nyes that's right , even though being directed by one of horror's most cherished directors , 'vampires' is the least bit scary , if not at all . \\njames woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the 'master' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight . \\ndaniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya , a wise-cracking guy who really isn't that funny . \\nin the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters , find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy . \\nof course we all know sunshine kills vampires , and that is just how they kill these vampires : hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death . \\nafter throwing a party for what happened , the vampires that did not die come back to trash it . \\nthey kill almost all of jack's team , leaving only a few alive . \\nsheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek , but not yet turned into a vampire . \\nshe is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek . \\nthey have to fight they're way against vampires , leading up to a finale that is well-done with great special effects . \\n'vampires' definately could have been done better . \\nthe make-up , special effects and story are first rate , but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had . \\nit to me had more humor than horror , almost being compared to 'fright night' with the mix of violence and comedy . \\njohn carpenter does a great job of directing this film . \\nhe eases through some tough times and saves the flaws , which are noticeable but forgettable . \\nthe script is clever and funny , with many lines that make us laugh out loud . \\ni much enjoyed 'vampires' with a few exceptions . \\nit's one of those films you see but don't take to heart . \\nyou enjoy the time you spent and go on . \\nthe recently released 'psycho' is the same way , it's not as good as you'd hope but it is fun and entertaining . \\n'vampires' is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer . \\n\",\n"," b'in \" the sweet hereafter , \" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living . \\nhe shows us how it isn\\'t dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings . \\non a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks . \\nfourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt . \\nfor the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives . \\nthey have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle . \\nalberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility . \\nthe bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident . \\nthe bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it . \\nhowever , according to stephens , there are no \" accidents \" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through . \\nhe goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger . \\nand , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money . \\nhowever , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money . \\nhe is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents . \\nhe has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner . \\nhis daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years . \\nshe calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for . \\n \" i don\\'t know who i\\'m taking to , \" he tells her . \\nin his mind , his daughter is dead . \\nthe lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town\\'s pain , but also his own . \\nhowever , not everyone in town wants it to happen . \\nbilly ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it . \\nhe has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman . \\nhe doesn\\'t want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds . \\nto him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn\\'t need outsiders like stephens getting in the way . \\ncentral to \" the sweet hereafter \" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into \" a wheelchair girl , \" as she puts it . \\naside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out . \\nit is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning\\'s poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town\\'s children away , one was left behind because he was crippled . \\nobviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town\\'s children left her alone by dying in the wreck . \\nher situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) . \\nthere is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film . \\nof all the storylines in \" the sweet hereafter , \" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film . \\negoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn\\'t condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up . \\nwhat egoyan has done in \" the sweet hereafter \" is really nothing short of miraculous . \\nin his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life . \\negoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold . \\n \" the sweet hereafter \" is quite the opposite ; egoyan\\'s stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy . \\n \" the sweet hereafter \" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked . \\nthe film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind . \\nthe beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements . \\nlike his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole . \\nhe works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease . \\nthe actual bus wreck itself doesn\\'t happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight . \\nbecause human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms . \\ncertainly one of the best films of 1997 , \" the sweet hereafter \" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film . \\n',\n"," b'the rapid-fire formula that worked so well in airplane ! , the \" police squad ! \" \\ntelevision series , top secret ! , three naked gun films , and two hot shots ! \\nmovies has finally reached a desperate dead-end with spy hard . \\neven ezio gregio\\'s the silence of the hams is arguably funnier than this over-extended spy- and action-movie spoof . \\nleslie nielsen stars as secret agent wd-40 , who returns from retirement to battle his old nemesis , general rancor ( a cackling andy griffith ) . \\nthe jokes fly in every direction and with hardly a hint of restraint , timing , or tact . \\nmost the movie is comprised of recycled airplane and naked gun gags , recreated movie sequences , and soggy star cameos . \\nyeah , maybe we * do * need ray charles driving an l . a . bus bound for a speed bump , but did mr . t , hulk hogan , and dr . joyce brothers also have to appear in the same movie ? \\nleslie nielsen plays it straight with his usual dopey flair . \\nthere is something oddly inspiring about the sight of nielsen wearing a nun\\'s habit , even the resulting sister act spoof is silly . \\nas are the bits directly lifted from home alone , pulp fiction , true lies , etc . etc . ( adolescent males might enjoy this mess , tho . \\nthe butt shots , breast peeks , penis pokes , flatulence gags , and related innuendo are right up beavis and butthead\\'s alley . ) \\nbeyond the hilarious title sequence with \" weird \" al yankovich performing the theme song , spy hard is barely the stock that it\\'s printed on . \\nmy recommendation : duck in while you\\'re waiting for another movie to start . \\nstay long enough to see the camera dart inside of weird al\\'s nostril and then leave . \\nyou won\\'t miss a thing . \\n',\n"," b'when i watch a movie like mike nichols\\' what planet are you from ? \\ni can\\'t help but feel like everyone is looking at me . \\nit\\'s as if all the audience is gazing at the back of my head in the darkness , eyes shooting daggers , quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard-earned money to spend their time watching this . . . \\nthis . . . \\nthing . \\ni shift uncomfortably in my seat . \\ni\\'m reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second- or third-rate celebrities engaging in a teleprompted \" funny \" conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award . \\nit\\'s not my fault , i know it\\'s not my fault , but dammit , someone\\'s gotta be embarrassed , because it doesn\\'t look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame . \\ni\\'m about to give you a list of names of people who are gonna make a movie together : garry shandling , annette bening , john goodman , greg kinnear , mike nichols . \\ndo any of these names make you instantly shudder ? \\nthe answer i would have come up with before today is no , this is quite a list of talented individuals we\\'ve got here . \\ngranted , john goodman was in the flintstones , and greg kinnear has turned in some less-than-lackluster leading man performances in certified failures like a smile like yours , but even so , they\\'ve got proven power as excellent supporting players . \\ngarry shandling has two television classics under his belt , his ingenious little it\\'s garry shandling\\'s show and the larry sanders show . \\nand for god\\'s sake , mike nichols directed the graduate , and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty . \\nso explain this . . . \\nthis . . . \\nthing . \\nwhat planet are you from ? \\npurports to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and women satirizing the whole pop-psychology mars/venus phenomenon . \\nbut what this movie winds up being is a collection of unfunny cringe-inducing moments coupled with uninsightful cringe-inducing moments ; the end result is , unsurprisingly , an unfunny , uninsightful , cringe-inducing , thoroughly icky embarrassment . \\ngarry shandling plays an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant males ( they reproduce through cloning , of course ) . \\nhis leaders put a select group of males through a series of tests designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth , find a female of the species , and impregnate her . \\nthey\\'re taught how to pretend that they\\'re listening by nodding and saying \" uh-huh , \" and how to compliment shoes . \\nimagine my delighted surprise when , oh heavens , all their carefully practiced tactics turn out to fail miserably , producing comedic results ! \\nthe lucky winner is fitted with a penis ( since theirs , after generations of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence . . . \\ni will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population has stopped evolving due to the fact that they\\'re all just clones . . . \\nwhoops , too late . ) \\nthe penis , when aroused , tends to make a humming noise . \\nthe writers , when frequently strapped for ideas , tend to turn to this as a source of \" comedy . \" \\nit isn\\'t funny the first time . \\nit isn\\'t funny the eighth time . \\nit isn\\'t funny the eighteenth time . \\nif anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious . \\ngarry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag . \\nhe\\'s meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling\\'s alien character , but he\\'s so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside . \\nkinnear\\'s scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples\\' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents\\' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks . \\nwow . \\nwhat a magnificent bastard . \\nnearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex-driven slimeball . \\nwhen kinnear\\'s wife walks into the office , there isn\\'t a single guy who doesn\\'t trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they\\'d never seen a woman before . \\nthe few guys that aren\\'t particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman\\'s detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics . \\nshandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear\\'s aa meetings . \\nshandling\\'s mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day . . . \\nthey get married . \\nyup . \\nthe next day . \\ncuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too ! \\nbening\\'s character

of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species . \\nshe\\'s unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling\\'s lines and lies that it borders on tragic . \\nthere\\'s a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant . \\nwhen garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the

to run so rampant . \\nlet\\'s all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one . \\nthere\\'s also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity . \\ngoodman , through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations , puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic ,

that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! \\nspice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . \\nit\\'s intended as a sort of hard day\\'s night , but ends up simply hard to watch . \\nwhen watching the spice girls , i\\'m reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . \\nthe spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . \\nthere\\'s ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you\\'re almost certain the post sticks out her throat . \\nthe film itself doesn\\'t really have a plot . \\nit follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their \" first live performance \" at albert hall . \\nthe action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . \\nthe various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even \\nwhen they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . \\nwhew . \\nfor some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . \\nfrom elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . \\nheck , even roger moore shows up , though he can\\'t decide if he\\'s parodying himself as james bond , or if he\\'s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . \\nrichard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band\\'s manager , clifford . \\nthe celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . \\nneither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . \\ntheir songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . \\nmy advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either \\noption will be more enjoyable than the film . \\nnon-fans should know to stay well away from this

price tag . \\nbut for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects . \\nand for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily . \\nthe frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get . \\nmichael j . fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts . \\nhe uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them . \\nthis is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago . \\nfrank's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson . \\nwhen dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox . \\nbut dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead . \\nthis leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost . \\nthings start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town . \\nfox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that . \\nso when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer . \\nfox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox's attempts to save her from this evil spirit . \\nthere are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh . \\nthe movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film . \\nthe mix between these genres are perfect . \\nno laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa . \\none point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman . \\nbut that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form . \\nmichael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife's death , and then is forced to confront this later on . \\nalvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine . \\nand jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare . \\nthe frighteners never once feels like it is running long . \\nthe first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters . \\nthis movie is probably what casper would've looked like if david lynch directed it . \\nit's easily the best film of the year , so far . \\n\",\n"," b'the word to describe sharon stone is \" wonder \" . \\nnot that she _is_ a wonder , but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent . \\nshe has a dynamic screen presence in \" basic instinct \" , turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in \" casino \" , but possesses neither of those here . \\nstone teams up with private school headmaster\\'s wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani\\'s thoroughly unlikable husband ( chazz palminteri ) . \\nin a comedy of errors and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock ( as in `homage to\\' [read \" steal from \" ] ) , it turns out that someone saw them or he\\'s not dead or maybe . . . \\nkathy bates turns in a credible , if unspectacular , performance as an investigative police detective . \\nher character is a bit dull but realistic , although her actions at the end are puzzling . \\nadjani is more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven to desperation . \\nit\\'s stone that is a disappointment among the actors . \\nhow can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films and come off as a blank in this one ? \\ncostumed in skin-tight clothes and looking down her nose at everyone , she is someone you would want to avoid because she is boring , not enticingly dangerous . \\neven the threat ( or promise ? ) of a lesbian relationship between the conspirators is only half played out . \\non the positive side , there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive . \\nthat is if you can put up with stone\\'s cardboard cut-out character and scenes directly lifted from hitch\\'s movies . \\n',\n"," b' \" knock off \" is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie . \\nit\\'s also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year . \\ni figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998 , but alas , it has already been found . \\njean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods . \\nrob schneider plays van damme\\'s partner , and rochon plays . . . \\nactually , i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be . \\nshe just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there . \\nmany things are not explained in this film , but i do know that for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick . \\nwhere chan comes off as endearing in his \" normal guy \" character seen in many of his films , van damme just comes off as a wimp . \\nwe\\'re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions . \\nto be more clear : i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie , and even then , it was not made too clear . \\nthe film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong . \\ntsui hark ( who directed van damme\\'s last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , \" double team \" ) never lets the camera rest for a second , and that\\'s no exaggeration . \\nwe are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme\\'s foot entering a shoe . \\nfabulous ! \\nseriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions , as long as they don\\'t get carried away . \\nfor example , look at sam raimi . \\n \" army of darkness \" , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story . \\nthat\\'s a concept that tsui can\\'t seem to grasp . \\nthe special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * \" knock off \" to the point where the audience doesn\\'t have a clue as to what\\'s happening any more . \\nanother problem with the film is that it looks cheap . \\nthe film stock used is of such low caliber that i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night . \\nand for some inexplicable reason , everyone\\'s voice seems to have been dubbed . \\neven the stars . \\nand even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent . \\nfor example , there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window . \\nthe car slams into the ground , and the left wheel is completely destroyed . \\nseconds later , the car drives off at full speed . \\nhey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie , but a line must be drawn somewhere . \\nfinally , the acting . \\nnobody gives a good performance in this film . \\nvan damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing \" everyman \" . \\nand schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene . \\neven the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . . \\nonce again , i have no idea who he was supposed to be . \\nin case i haven\\'t yet made it clear enough , \" knock off \" is the worst movie of van damme\\'s career and possibly the worst movie of the decade . \\nand it\\'s not even one of those movies that\\'s so bad it\\'s funny . \\nit\\'s too inept to be funny . \\nthere are no redeeming factors in \" knock off \" and i seriously hope that every print of this film is burned to a crisp and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased . \\n',\n","

terrace . \\nand to watch this film is almost as painful . \\n \" get carter \" is a gloomy looking , unimaginative film that offers no joy . \\njack carter is as tough as tough guys come . \\nhe works out of vegas as a self-described \\'financial adjuster\\' . \\nexplaining his duties , he says , \" people make promises and break them . \\ni help them remember . \" \\nhe has a chiseled body full of tattoos . \\nhe has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times . \\nhe speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice . \\nin other words , this is sylvester stallone acting like . . . sylvester \\nstallone . \\nand like most of his previous roles , his character is a shallow , one-dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough , hassle a few hapless people , find out what he needs to know , and then dispense his own kind of justice . \\nwith the charisma of a pit bull , being tough is all that jack carter knows . \\nyet , even tough guys know when to put family first . \\nas the story begins , we learn that jack\\'s little brother has died in a car accident . \\nthe police attribute it to heavy drinking . \\nhowever , jack is suspicious , believing that he was \\'taken out\\' . \\nhe takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth . \\nas he pokes around , he runs into several lowlife characters . \\nthey include a shady business partner , a prostitute , a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates , and an oily owner of a porn website . \\nany one of them may know something about his brother\\'s death . \\nall of them have the means of carrying out the deed . \\nbut don\\'t expect an exercise in sleuthing where well-placed clues lead carter to the truth . \\nhe\\'s all brawn and no brains , so there are no epiphanies during his investigation . \\ninstead , he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward , cycling through this circle of suspects . \\nflustered with his lack of progress , he cycles through them again and again . \\nthis all gets tiring fairly quickly . \\nby the time the film launches into its final act , we\\'re numb from its pedestrian pace . \\noddly , as a tough-guy thriller , it starves us for action . \\nadmittedly , there is one nifty chase sequence , but this is related to a tangential and needless plot ( carter\\'s vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him ) . \\nthe story also fails to generate any kind of emotion . \\nstallone has the personality of a slab of stone . \\nand the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast . \\nthe weather is constantly overcast or rainy . \\nmeanwhile , most shots take place at night , in dimly lit rooms , or in dark alleys . \\nit\\'s just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere . \\nas a result , \" get carter \" amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller , bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement . \\nyou\\'re better off leaving this guy alone .

the means to stop the aliens in time ? \\ndirector ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hit , 1984\\'s \" ghostbusters , \" but \" evolution \" falls miserably short . \\none reason is readily apparent . \\n \" ghostbusters \" had three really funny guys as its scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , and harold ramis ) , but \" evolution \" has one really funny guy ( orlando jones ) who can adlib and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else\\'s hands . \\nfor good measure , \" ghostbusters \" had the comic talents of rick moranis ; \" evolution \" offers seann william scott , who was much funnier in \" american pie \" and \" road trip \" than he is here . \\nscott has one amusing scene where he sings \" you are so beautiful to me \" to a dragon-like alien to draw it into a trap . \\nother than that , scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gave him . \\nan actor in search of a forte , david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in \" playing god \" and his romantic side in \" return to me . \" \\nnow he wants to find his wacky comedic talent ; what we all find is that he doesn\\'t have any . \\nlook for him to be back on tv in five years or so . \\nanother sad case is julianne moore , who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts . \\nshe\\'s a talented actress with an impressive list of credits and award nominations , so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy ? \\nher character has a tendency to trip over and bump into things , but the trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs . \\nthe sole saving grace of the film is jones . \\nhe\\'s at the center of the movie\\'s funniest scene -- where an alien bug invades harry\\'s body and has to be pulled out through his ass . \\njones is the only cast member who can take the comedic ball and run with it , but he can\\'t carry the whole movie by himself . \\nhe found himself in a similar situation in \"

8\\'s ill-natured , hard-nosed owner--veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy ; he really hams it up with his snorts , grimaces , and scowls . \\nuhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television , including game shows , tabloid talk shows , children\\'s shows , dizzy news women , and movies--everything from rambo to close encounters . \\nthe funniest scene , the one that made my head spin , is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed . \\nlike most movies in its genre , uhf is hit or miss . \\nfor every gag that works , at least one fizzles . \\nfor instance , weird al\\'s mock video of \" money for nothing \" by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt ( although it does have some nifty computer animation ) . \\nbut the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail ; we know another gut wrencher is on the way . \\nin fact , uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane-type movie since . . . \\nwell , since airplane . \\nmuch of the credit goes to weird al\\'s exceptionally inventive script and to the movie\\'s winsome cast .

mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am , dresses like don johnson in \" miami vice \" with less pastels , and has sworn off alcohol . \\nhowever , he still smokes his lucky strikes , detests all forms of authority , and kills at a whim . \\nbeyond that , the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page-turner by spillane , probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writers . \\nthe movie starts off with a bang : a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series , complete with cheesy graphics and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti ( \" rocky \" ) . \\nafter that , the movie and the book begin the same , with the murder of jack williams ( frederick downs ) , a one-armed detective and hammer\\'s best friend . \\nhammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack\\'s death , and with the help of his devoted secretary , the blond and shapely velda ( laurene landon ) , and the alternately friendly / antagonistic police chief pat chambers ( paul sorvino ) , he is immediately on the killer\\'s trail . \\nhere the movie splits completely from the book , and dives into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactics involving the mafia , the cia , one of hammer\\'s vietnam vet buddies , and a kinky sex clinic . \\nmany of the same characters from the book appear in the movie , but they take on slightly different roles . \\nfor instance , charles kalecki ( alan king ) , a numbers runner and narcotics dealer in the book , turns into a suave mob boss . \\nand , more importantly , hammer\\'s suspicious love interest , charlotte bennett ( barbara carrera ) , morphs from a run-of-the-mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic . \\n \" i , the jury \" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane\\'s books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood\\'s production code . \\nalthough this takes the 1982 version of \" i , the jury \" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book . \\nrest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women . \\nit features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself . \\nno one would deny that spillane\\'s writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling . \\nit\\'s no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor . \\n \" i , the jury \" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn\\'t do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made . \\nthe script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like \" it\\'s alive \" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , \" q \" ( 1981 ) , and \" the stuff \" ( 1985 ) . \\ncohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director\\'s chair after only a week\\'s worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget . \\nhe was quickly replaced by richard t . heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects . \\nheffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently . \\nit shows in the final product . \\ncohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none . \\nhe shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull . \\nthe movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron\\'s background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , \" i , the jury , \" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth . \\nbut the problems in \" i , the jury \" run deeper than the technical . \\nthe central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties . \\nbecause spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer\\'s character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona . \\nwe never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don\\'t have hammer in them at all . \\nconsequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane\\'s storytelling is lost . \\nthe period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer\\'s moral code is thrown to the wind . \\ndespite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code . \\nthe title itself , \" i , the jury , \" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law . \\nunlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment . \\nin this way , he can be seen as \" above the law , \" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality . \\nthe movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society\\'s terms , but in any terms , especially his own . \\nif anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful . \\nmaybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer\\'s character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie . \\nthe blame for hammer\\'s character can\\'t be laid on assante\\'s shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance . \\nspillane never once described hammer\\'s physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him . \\nof course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane\\'s books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963\\'s \" the girl hunters , \" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) . \\nthe rest of actors are most un-noteworthy . \\nwith the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino , everyone who appeared in \" i , the jury \" were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere . \\nmany of them ended up working in television ( like carrera , who had a short stint on \" dallas \" in the mid-eighties ) , which only adds to the made-for-tv atmosphere of the film . \\nmaybe someday , someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book , but this is certainly not it . \\n',\n"," b'it is an understood passion and an understood calm . \\nbud white walks into the home of

disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . \\nconsequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito\\'s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . \\nit doesn\\'t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . \\ncarlito\\'s way , while hampered by depalma\\'s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . \\ncarlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . \\nin 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . \\nhe declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . \\namong those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito\\'s crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . \\ncarlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . \\nold ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can\\'t seem to shake . \\ncarlito\\'s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . \\nin the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . \\nboth highlight depalma\\'s gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . \\nyet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . \\ncarlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . \\nbut where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there\\'s more of an immediacy to carlito\\'s way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . \\nyou sense that there\\'s no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . \\nindeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : \" you don\\'t get reformed ; you just run out of wind . \" \\npacino captures carlito\\'s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . \\nsean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . \\na jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . \\nhe could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . \\nhe shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . \\nas compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . \\ndepalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . \\nhe even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . \\nfrom a story standpoint , there\\'s an obligatory love story with a cliche\\'d long-suffering girlfriend character . \\npenelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn\\'t do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . \\nstill , it\\'s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . \\nthe two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn\\'t break . \\ncarlito\\'s way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . \\nthose willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . \\n',\n"," b'the yet-to-be-released krippendorf\\'s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware . \\nthis movie can\\'t make up its mind . \\nis it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ? \\nor is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ? \\neither way , \" unbalanced \" is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort . \\nthe premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years \" getting over \" the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses . \\nnow it\\'s time to show what he\\'s achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it . \\nwith a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald\\'s . \\nbut when his \" discovery \" becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it . \\nwith the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the \" shelmikedmu \" tribe ( named from the first half of each child\\'s name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf\\'s backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe . \\ndespite the professor\\'s wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf\\'s main assistant . \\nhungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books . \\nkrippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc . thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe . \\non the opposing end is krippendorf\\'s arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe . \\nit\\'s a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf\\'s tribe could\\'ve been a real winner . \\nsadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a \" family comedy \" ) just aren\\'t the right tone for this film . \\ncut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you\\'ve got a good start . \\nat the state it\\'s in now , you\\'ve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs . \\ndoubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that\\'s not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try . \\nthe overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of \" average \" , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them . \\nmost of the characters are surprisingly two-dimensional , and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort ( lyonne ) seems to go greatly unappreciated . \\ndirector todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways . \\nit\\'s stuck in limbo between disney family fare ( jungle 2 jungle ) and potentially hilarious adult comedy ( a fish called wanda ) . \\nit\\'s this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade , and it\\'s a brutal drop . \\na strong warning to parents : forget the impression given by advertisements , do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she\\'s holding his penis ? \\nyes , it\\'s put that bluntly ! \\njust be warned - this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film , and others might not be as tame . \\n',\n"," b\"the second serial-killer thriller of the month is just awful . \\noh , it starts deceptively okay , with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work . \\nafter a baby-sitter gets gutted in the suit- ably spooky someone's-in-the-house prologue , parallel stories unfold , the first involving a texas sheriff ( r . lee emery ) , a gruesome double murder , and the arrival of a morose fbi agent ( dennis quaid ) on the eve of voting for the local lawman's reelection . \\nthe second pairs a hitch- hiker ( jared leto ) with a friendly former railroad worker ( danny glover ) . \\nthey're headed west , toward the rockies and away from the murder scene . \\nwhich one is the killer ? \\nwell , it doesn't really matter , 'cause when writer/first-time director jeb stuart ( die hard ) finally spills the beans , you won't take his choice seriously anyway . \\nthe whole thing goes south about an hour in , with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly couldn't follow . \\nand through the whole thing there's quaid , playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea- gal . \\ni guess i'm glad that i didn't walk out-- there's some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr . \\nstrangelove . \\n\",\n"," b' ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information . ) \\nseven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs . \\nit is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled . \\nwhile this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance . \\nfor starters , classifying seven as a \" thriller \" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film . \\nwhile i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an \" intense drama , \" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up . \\npart of director david finchers accomplishment is in style . \\nhe seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as \" simple \" as a corpse . \\nand visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin\\'s always-grisly special effects ) . \\nthrow in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene . \\nthese scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing . \\nyet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment . \\nin addition to style , fincher supplies substance . \\nseven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society . \\ndetective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world . \\nits easy to see why . \\nthe world doesn\\'t make sense . \\n ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct . \\nafter knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . ) \\nwhy should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and \" picking up the pieces \" he will be able to catch the killer ? \\nsomersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he\\'s naive in this films portrayal of the world ) . \\nhe completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope . \\nhowever , david\\'s wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn\\'t even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment . \\nthese three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered . \\nand in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do . \\nbut if there\\'s one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) . \\nseven\\'s payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does . \\none important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a \" psycho , \" with no motives behind his slayings . \\nthis is exactly the mistake mills makes . \\nin the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society . \\nhe\\'s a killer who kills those who are bringing society down . \\nin his mind he didn\\'t kill \" innocent \" people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) . \\nhes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent . \\nreally , seven doesn\\'t just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is . \\nseven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society\\'s degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does . \\nbesides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller . \\nit features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair . \\nbut then again , its a cruel world . \\n',\n"," b'this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard . \\nthe rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend . . . ned \\nkelly , the so-called robin hood of the aussies . \\nbut he fails to be convincing , in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly . \\nthe film opens to a b/w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution . \\nthen it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback , coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family . \\nthis scene is set in 1871 . \\nin the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings , as he sings shel silverstein\\'s lyrics , which tells -- of ned\\'s hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic . \\nned says a debt must be paid . . . \\nas he hears voices from his dead father , his class-divided country , and his conscience , all telling him to get revenge . \\nso begins ned\\'s romp through australia\\'s outback , seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered . \\nhe begins by stealing horses , after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray , which favors the rich landowners . \\nwhen he\\'s only 20 he forms a gang , causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police , who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds . \\nwhen ned\\'s mother ( clarissa kaye ) is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 3-5 years , ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother\\'s freedom . \\nwhen the authorities refuse , the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage , burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers . \\nrampaging through the outback , they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes , who don\\'t trust the traps ( police ) . \\nspoiler to follow in the next paragraph . \\nin the climax , kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police , but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured . \\nned\\'s brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive . \\nbut kelly\\'s gang escapes , as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers , as they become decoys . \\nthis was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly\\'s call for justice . \\njagger didn\\'t have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson . \\nthe story failed to focus on australia , seemingly a more british film than australian . \\nunder richardson\\'s lackluster direction , all jagger seemed to do , was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge , which soon became a shrill cry . \\nif you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch \" mad dog morgan \" ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly\\'s madness , something this film could only do in a

its trio of above-the-title stars , patrick swayze , demi moore , and whoopi goldberg . \\neight years later , moore and goldberg\\'s careers aren\\'t exactly thriving , but they have had their share of screen successes since ; the same can\\'t be said of swayze , who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog . \\nforget the mortal kombat movies--this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games . \\ngood truck driver jack crews ( swayze ) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey . \\nalong the

have trouble keeping track of who\\'s driving what , all of red\\'s vehicles , be it a pickup or a big rig , are painted--you guessed it--red . \\ni could go into more of the plot specifics ( such as jack\\'s dream of having a nice home with his family , the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license , the fbi/atf crew tracking the cargo ) , but they are of little importance . \\nall that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b . but they fail at even this modest goal , for none of the highway chaos , as credibly staged as it is , is terribly interesting , let alone exciting . \\nonce you\\'ve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time , you\\'ve seen it every time . \\nas dreary as black dog is as an entertainment , the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen ; it\\'s that swayze has to reduce himself to such work . \\nwhile far from the best of actors , he is certainly not horrible , and he is a charismatic presence . \\ni don\\'t know if it\\'s his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog . \\nregardless , if he continues on this career track , could a tv series be far behind ? \\n',\n"," b' \" the fighting sullivans \" contains a major plot development in the last ten minutes that every movie guide has seen fit to give away . \\nthere was no dramatic tension for me while watching the film , as i knew exactly what was going to happen . \\nand that\\'s the worst thing that can happen before viewing a movie . \\nbecause of this , i will tread lightly so i don\\'t ruin it for anyone reading this review , and it would be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after you have seen it . \\n \" the fighting sullivans \" revolves around a family that consists of a mother , father , sister , and five brothers . \\nthe brothers are very close , despite the occasional disagreement . \\nthey are inseperable , and never stray from one another . \\ntheir friendship and loyalty is the foundation of this picture . \\nthe first half of the movie follows the brothers as young children , and their various adventures . \\nwhen four of them get into a fight with some local boys , the youngest sullivan , who is inside a church at the time , comes running out to assist , but not before properly exiting the chapel . \\nif i\\'m being awfully vague about details , it\\'s because what i have told you is essentially the first hour and a half . \\nall i can say is go watch this film , because it is a fine portrait of a family that sticks together , through the good and the bad . \\nand after you see the movie , you will understand why this review has been written the way it has . \\n',\n"," b'bad . bad . \\nbad . \\nthat one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls . \\nif that summary isn\\'t enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ? \\nstill haven\\'t got the point ? \\nother than director russ meyer\\'s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie . \\nthat is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . \\nafter watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . \\nthis movie stinks out loud . \\nquite frankly , this movie deserves a . \\nbut there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny . \\nso i\\'m giving it a . \\nand maybe that is too generous . \\nright from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands . \\nnot only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform . \\ni had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . \\nto be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . \\nwith the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn\\'t have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . \\nso what is this movie about ? \\nyou ask . \\nlike it really matters . \\nok , here goes . \\nthis all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry . \\nonce there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn\\'t for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them . \\neverything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . \\nthere are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing . \\n>from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here . \\nother than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have . \\nthe dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts . \\nmr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of \" hey man \" , \" dig \" and my all time favorite -- \" this is my happening , and it freaks me out \" . \\nnow i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ? \\nebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . \\nmaybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter . \\ni don\\'t know , but all the big words in the world wouldn\\'t be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . \\nbut the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie . \\ni\\'ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . \\nin fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries . \\nadd to the directing and writing the music in this movie . \\ni almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . \\nthen we have the cast . \\nfirst lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band . \\nthis has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . \\nsadly , his acting doesn\\'t come close to making up for his looks . \\nif you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn\\'t surprise you . \\nmeyer\\'s stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets . \\ndolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band . \\nand no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents . \\nand yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . \\nsadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . \\nhey , it a sexist movie , so i\\'m writing a sexist review . \\nthen we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . \\nthis goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . \\nmeyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . \\nsure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . \\non the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . \\ni sound like i\\'m writing a review in a porn magazine . \\nbut hey , i\\'ll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . \\nand since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . \\nthe only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . \\nunless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . \\nand if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d\\'s -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . \\nthis is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . \\nan even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense . \\nproceed with extreme caution . \\n',\n"," b'you would think that this film\\'s dismal failure would be due to american filmmakers getting hold of a brilliant british comedy and \" americanizing \" it . \\nyou\\'d be wrong , since full blame can be placed on the very folks who wrote and created the series : rowan atkinson , robin driscoll , and richard curtis . \\nshould you ever happen to meet those chaps , do me a favor . \\ngrab them by the hair and yell really loudly in their ear , \" what were you thinking ? ! \\nhave you ever heard the phrase \\'if it ain\\'t broke don\\'t fix it\\' ? ! \" \\nthen walk away . \\nthe film concerns mr . bean ( atkinson ) and his visit to america while escorting the painting of \" whistler\\'s mother \" to an american buyer ( played by burt reynolds , in the type of bit part that his success in \" boogie nights \" should hopefully do away with ) . \\nnow how or why mr . bean is sent on this trip makes no sense , and i can\\'t even describe how the film explains it . \\nthe point is that mr . bean comes to america and causes wacky trouble . \\nproblems problems problems , where to begin ? \\nfirst , the score music from the tv show has been completely replaced by score that is either at times one note away from the score from \" beetlejuice \" or one note away from the score from \" rob roy \" . \\nthen , the song choices are totally uninspired . \\n \" good vibrations \" ? \\n \" i love l . a . \" ? \\nwow , don\\'t put any thought into that guys . \\nalso , bean makes way too much noise in the film . \\nthe character doesn\\'t speak much , but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience , and maybe the occasional murmur from mr . bean . \\neach episode was like a chaplin silent movie . \\nin the film , bean is constantly moaning , grunting , whining , etc . it\\'s annoying , and just plain wrong for the character . \\nthe main problem though is that it\\'s just not funny . \\nwith each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes . \\nmultiply that running time by three however , and the laughs steadily decrease . \\nthey even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series . \\nsad , and creatively lazy . \\nas a series , \" mr . bean \" only ran for about 13 episodes or so . \\nwhy on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything ? \\n13 half-hour episodes certainly hadn\\'t exhausted all possible situations . \\nall i can say positively for the film at this point is that it\\'s almost appropriate for all ages , if it wasn\\'t for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr . bean is having sex with things . \\nand even that isn\\'t a very positive statement . \\nplease guys , go back to england and go back to television so you\\'ll make me laugh again . \\n[pg-13] \\n',\n"," b' \" the animal \" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling . \\nit\\'s clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill . \\nthere are certainly better things you can do with your time . \\nactually , if you\\'ve seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments . \\nthe story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer . \\nbut he\\'s afflicted with loser-itis . \\ndogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him . \\ntruthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we\\'d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun . \\nthis is actually bad because you can\\'t like a character if you can\\'t develop sympathy for him . \\nwe never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor . \\nhowever , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs . \\nas a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed . \\nhe can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah . \\nimagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation . \\nwith his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him . \\nhowever , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges . \\ngoats beware ! \\nhe also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies . \\nwhat he should\\'ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich . \\nequally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he\\'s black . \\n \" it\\'s reverse racism , \" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything . \\nthis element doesn\\'t work the first time it\\'s mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence . \\nyou don\\'t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that \" the animal \" is tame . \\nif there\\'s any reason to see this film , it\\'s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut . \\nremember her ? \\nshe was voted off in week 11 of the 13-week program , \" survivor . \" \\nhere , she plays marvin\\'s sunny love interest . \\nwhile her role required very little actual acting , she seemed very comfortable ( even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog . . . yuck ! ) . \\nwith her adorable disposition , radiant smile , and playful innocence , she could be a meg ryan in the making . \\nit\\'s too bad that she\\'s in such a mediocre offering \\n',\n"," b'the

enough , the screenplay\\'s pacing makes the movie even slower ! \\nit takes the entire first half hour to establish the movie\\'s premise , then more time as the film wades through a tortuous ( and

( kinda ) , both have hot young stars , both have an annoying alternative soundtrack , and both are aimed at the teenage crowd , which i guess includes me . \\nbut this is not the next in line with the \" scream \" flicks as well as the \" i know what you did last summer \" soon to be flicks . \\nit owes less to \" halloween \" and more to kafka and orwell , which , in my book , makes for a more interesting feature . \\nand it should have been . \\nthis is basically a rehash of \" the stepford wives , \" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross and dealing , as i\\'ve been told , with a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives . \\nor something like that . \\n \" behavior , \" starring katie holmes of \" dawson\\'s creek , \" deals with a bunch of teenagers

penmen who has written stuff like \" beautiful girls \" and \" things to do in denver when you\\'re dead \" ( as well as \" con air \" ) , it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights and satiric wit . \\nalas , it\\'s not , and it plumets into that little group of movies known as \" the movies with potential that blow it . \" \\ni remember a film called \" white

on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves . \\nit\\'s a stage , and this film does in fact realize that . \\nit gets its message across and it does it effortlessly .

next to die ? \\nthe film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they\\'re not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who\\'s having trouble at home because he hasn\\'t gotten over his brother\\'s ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don\\'t recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from \" dawson\\'s creek \" ) , who\\'s chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from \" the man without a face \" ) , who\\'s the most interesting because he\\'s the only character who\\'s given some dimension . \\nin the film\\'s best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one\\'s fetishes and hang-ups , and it\\'s the best scene in the movie because it\\'s witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn\\'t . \\ngavin suspects there\\'s something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he\\'s only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff . \\nhere , we have another case of \" the idiot plot , \" where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor . \\nthe only other half-interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be . . . but \\nreally , we don\\'t care anyway . \\ni probably shouldn\\'t mention that this was directed by david nutter , who\\'s works for \" the x-files , \" because that would probably tarnish his reputation . \\nlike the show , he\\'s good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel . \\nmost of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works . \\nbut what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff . \\nhe keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just don\\'t get the hell out of there . \\ni think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there\\'s something rotten in the state of teen angstdom . \\nwhat this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier . \\nif the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by bruce greenwood , an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed , then they need to come up with a tougher , smarter villain . \\nif he\\'s so villainous , then why could two dense teenagers who couldn\\'t figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ? \\nthe film , which runs about 80 or so minutes , just needs to work on these things , and become a lot less sloppy . \\nat such a short running time and with such lame , boring characters as these , it\\'s pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one\\'s mouth , especially mine . \\n',\n"," b\"salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets . \\nactors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation . \\nproof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding . \\nface of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster . \\none day she decides to retire , but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that . \\nrealising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins . \\nterri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater . \\nalthough tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired . \\non the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name . \\nmartin sheen's brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway . \\nunfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding's silver screen debut proved to be her last film . \\n\",\n"," b'i was

thomas anderson\\'s boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s . \\nthis was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics . \\nthis was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story . \\none of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete . \\nin this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette . \\nburt reynold\\'s manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner . \\nhorner\\'s has a steady \" family \" of performers , some of whom live in his plush l . a . home . \\nbut in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better . \\nwhen horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable . \\nit is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his . \\nas directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door . \\nboogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . \\'s hardcore film scene . \\nbut the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends . \\nthe downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut . \\nby the film\\'s final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams . \\nboogie nights is not about sex . \\nit does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers . \\nin fact , the film isn\\'t really about pornography at all . \\npornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are . \\nthe film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world . \\nyet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively . \\nthe characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion . \\nfirst stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son . \\nsecond stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h . macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley ) . \\nbut the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams . \\neddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it . \\nwith no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame . \\nhis alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house . \\nhorner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born . \\nthe surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her \" babies \" provides some of the films most poignant scenes . \\nclearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children . \\nbut the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to . \\neven the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family . \\nthen again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all . \\neddie adams , who later takes on the screen name \" dirk diggler \" , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg . \\ni say \" former \" pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job . \\nthis is bold and brave territory for such a young man . \\nhe pulls it off marvelously . \\nwahlberg is a \" big , bright star \" with a big bright future . \\nboogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness . \\nits intimate studies of character make it the superior film . \\nwahlberg\\'s surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson\\'s . \\nbut in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year . \\ni got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance . \\nstill , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway . . . ya \\nknow , kinda like disco . \\n',\n"," b'years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other

so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously . \\ni _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects . \\nhey chris : did you forget ? \\nyour thoughts are _real_ . \\nthey are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay . \\nso , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ? \\nand then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ? \\nbecause there would be no movie , that+s why . \\nand albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr . ) says bluntly : \" that+s fantasy . \" \\numm . . . \\nif your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real . \\nsurely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that . \\nand if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren\\'t big enough

following review encompasses two versions of dune : \\ndune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book . \\nthe film\\'s visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative . \\ndune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television . \\nit was disowned by director david lynch but it\\'s considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline . \\nquality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web . \\n * * * the review * * * \\nreleased in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert\\'s cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans . \\ndirector david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico . \\nthe screenplay was lynch\\'s own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected . \\ndune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors . \\nthe key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that\\'s home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange . \\nthe spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe . \\nit extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it . \\nmost importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to \" fold space \" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish . \\nlynch\\'s film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story\\'s two main strands . \\none is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis . \\nthe second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen . \\nthe deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom . \\nunfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended . \\nthe thinking among universal\\'s oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office . \\nwith lynch\\'s initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made . \\nwhat a great idea ! \\nwhy not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ? \\nthe most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters . \\nthus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul\\'s father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless . \\nthe end result is a distinct chill : we can\\'t warm to most of the cast and we don\\'t care much for them . \\nand it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book . \\ndune is also a very serous film . \\nthe constant \" self-talk \" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment . \\nthe overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them . \\nhumour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen\\'s mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find . \\nyou may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus\\' star wars trilogy . \\nthe theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however . \\nit still possesses enough of lynch\\'s stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi . \\nspecial effects whiz carlo rambaldi\\'s giant sandworms are an awesome sight . \\nboth the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original . \\nand the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years . \\nwith these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis\\' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses . \\nsee it in the widescreen format if you can . \\nand despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen . \\nsian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who\\'s secret aim is to manipulate paul\\'s destiny for its own shadowy ends . \\nas paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade . \\nthe conclusion ? \\nany assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert\\'s original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker . \\ndavid lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects . \\ndune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release . \\nmany chose to stay away altogether , as the film\\'s disastrous box office showing attests . \\nthe extended version , however , is a rather different beast . \\nin 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition \" director\\'s cut \" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres . \\nbut , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects . \\nin a way , then , it is partly lynch\\'s own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa . \\nstung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director\\'s guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with \" allen smithee \" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work . \\nhe also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous \" judas booth \" . \\ncertainly , looking at the results of mca\\'s handiwork there\\'s at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object . \\nbut these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas . \\nmost of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version\\'s storyline . \\npaul\\'s relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously . \\nthe political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained . \\npaul\\'s initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably . \\nand as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe . \\nas a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv\\'s version of dune is clearly superior . \\nas a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept . \\nthe use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate . \\nthere\\'s some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order . \\nand the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg . \\nships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context . \\nthis is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so . \\nit should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television . \\nbut the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn\\'t even in herbert\\'s book . \\nthe scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his \" heart plug \" . \\nits a surreal and disturbing episode that\\'s very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work . \\ndespite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film . \\nall up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences . \\nunless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the \" alan smithee \" version remains the closest we\\'ll get to what the movie should have been . \\non repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit . \\nstill , as one of this century\\'s great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen . \\nwith rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga . \\n',\n"," b\"i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies . \\nluckily , my video

gilliam and tony grisoni \\ndirected by terry gilliam \\ni\\'ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid . \\ndropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last . \\nthen there\\'s the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose . \\nmushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing . \\nacid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy . \\nmy point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie . \\nfull of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s . thompson\\'s book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out . \\nbut for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag . \\nfear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed \" gonzo \" journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney\\'s convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 . \\noperating under the pseudonyms of \" raoul duke \" and \" dr . \\ngonzo \" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers . \\nthey terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them . \\nduke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge . \\ndr . gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane\\'s \" white rabbit \" reaches its climax . \\nand these guys don\\'t just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead . \\nthat neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view . \\nthompson\\'s book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document . \\nit simultaneously exposed the 60\\'s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die . \\npontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson\\'s message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy . \\nit\\'s a cheech and chong movie . \\nyou\\'re there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down . \\nthere\\'s nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard . \\nthis is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes . \\nthere are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen . \\nbut to what end ? \\nmuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson\\'s book , and there are some priceless comic observations . \\nbut you\\'re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . \\nthis brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . \\ndepp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson\\'s dialogue . \\nin between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . \\nwatching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . \\nit\\'s interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . \\nas much of a fan as i am of gilliam\\'s work , cox would have been the better choice . \\nsid and nancy , cox\\'s best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . \\ngilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . \\nwhat kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? \\nit doesn\\'t try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn\\'t work as broad comedy . \\nif he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . \\nbut i don\\'t want to be too hard on it . \\nthere are some truly funny moments , and if you\\'re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . \\ni do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect . \\n',\n"," b'that is , unless you\\'re one of those people who have seen the preview a thousand times on tv or in the theaters . \\ni can tell you one thing now : they gave the entire movie away . \\nwhy someone would want to base an entire movie on one premise and then give that crucial detail away in the trailers is beyond me . \\nhowever , if they * hadn\\'t * given it away , the film would\\'ve still been suprisingly devoid of suspense given its subject matter . \\nobviously , the producers thought they could remake \" the deep end of the ocean , \" throw in tommy lee jones and a couple of cliches and call it an action drama . \\n \" double jeopardy \" offers solid acting from ashley judd and tommy lee jones , who got first billing even though he didn\\'t see to be on screen half as much as judd did . \\nit also offers some genuinely funny , clever , or full-of-tension moments ( my favorite : judd waking up in the coffin ) , but none of that can salvage the film from its insanely predictable plot . \\nhalf the time i\\'m wondering whether i\\'m watching one of those overhyped tv miniseries , which always turn out to be less exciting than advertised . \\njudging by the beginning , end , and a huge chunk of the middle , i might have been watching a special hallmark presentation too . \\nthe movie\\'s stretching for an almost two hour long film with only 30 minutes worth of material . \\nimplausible material , no less . \\nloose interpretation of one of the amendments aside , too many times in the movie i thought , \" that is * not * possible * . \" \\nthat kind of stuff is excusable in popcorn movies , but not one like \" double jeopardy \" that tries to pass itself off as serious drama . \\neverything seems dragged out , overplayed . \\nwhen they should\\'ve kept us in the dark , they let the cat out of the bag too early . \\n',\n"," b'the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is . \\nit is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously . \\nmr . gregg \" i\\'m-having-a-mid-life-crisis \" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world . \\nand how does he show it ? \\nby really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this . \\noh , and it gets better . \\na similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i\\'m not counting the several masturbation scenes ) . \\nin it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of \" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? \" \\nsorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus . \\nof course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can\\'t even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it\\'s a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) . \\n \" the doom generation \" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another \" teen angst \" film ( one of the slogans is \" teen is a four-letter word \" - hardy har har ) . \\nit\\'s a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in \" scream \" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid\\'s son in \" independence day \" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in \" that thing you do ! \" \\n- and by the way , do you get the symbolism ? \\nred , white , and blue ? \\nhuh ? \\nhuh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them . \\nthe film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films . \\ngregg araki obviously has seen such films as \" easy rider , \" \" natural born killers , \" and \" kalifornia , \" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide . \\nbut what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper . \\n \" the doom generation \" doesn\\'t want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level . \\nhe wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about . \\nhere\\'s one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff . \\namy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out . \\nshe tells him to fuck off or something to that note . \\nhe points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly . \\njordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter . \\nthe cash register rings up \" 6 . 66 \" \\n ( oh , and this symbolism doesn\\'t stop here ) . \\njordan checks for his wallet but it\\'s really in the car . \\nhe asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well . \\nthe clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money . \\nthey say they don\\'t have it . \\nhe gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk\\'s head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) . \\nthe head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream . \\ni don\\'t really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out . \\naraki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he\\'ll make some kind of art . \\nwrong . \\nit takes a kind of resistance to make gore art . \\nwhen george romero made \" dawn of the dead , \" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick . \\nsame goes for peter jackson\\'s disgustingly gory \" dead alive , \" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies . \\nit was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled . \\na scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens . \\nhere\\'s a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances . \\nalso , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn\\'t really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o\\'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn\\'t when they signed to be in \" caligula \" ) . \\npeople such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher \" peter brady \" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line . \\nwhy are they here ? \\nso that we can all point to them and say \" hey , look it\\'s ( fill in the blank ) ! \\nwow ! \" \\ngimme a break . \\nthe film\\'s meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there\\'s a giant explosion of horrific violence . \\notherwise defined as \" teen angst , \" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you . \\nlook , i\\'m 19 years old . \\ni went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did . \\ni\\'ve since moved on to \" i don\\'t really know what to do with my life \" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they\\'re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse . \\npart of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters . \\nit\\'s not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent . \\nthis is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they\\'re these great people who are being punished by the world because they\\'re teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can\\'t totally overcome them . \\nit\\'s not their fault they kill people ; it\\'s the world\\'s ! \\nwhat they really need is a reality check . \\nthe world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting . \\nbut part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it . \\nthe film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there\\'s nothing they can do about it . \\nhence the title . \\nnot only does it have bad fallacy , but it can\\'t even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner . \\neverything\\'s overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex . \\nhow does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ? \\nhow does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ? \\nand why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ? \\nif araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he\\'d show them for what they really are . \\nand if he didn\\'t want the satirical approach , he\\'d show the real problems with the world . \\nand if you still don\\'t think that \" the doom generation \" is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting . \\nrose macgowan is horrible . \\nyes , she proved herself talented in \" scream , \" but she\\'s so bad in \" the doom generation \" that if i had not seen her in \" scream , \" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today . \\nher entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it\\'s laughable . \\nequally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn\\'t have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain . \\nhis performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in \" that thing you do ! \" \\nand then there\\'s james duval . \\nlet\\'s just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando . \\nhe has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him \" least talented actor in the world . \" \\ni have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst . \\nor at least somewhere up there . \\nhere\\'s another example of a bad scene , if you\\'re still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they\\'re playing nine inch nail\\'s most banal song , \" heresy \" ( example of the lines : \" god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i\\'ll see you there \" ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent . \\nthe film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says \" fuck . \" \\nno explanation of this should be necessary . \\nand finally , a note to gregg : grow up . \\nreally . \\nmove out of your parent\\'s basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job . \\nand don\\'t quit it . \\n',\n"," b'recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources . \\neach review compared this film to the truman show . \\nwhy ? \\nthe only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television . \\nother than that , the two movies are completely different from each other . \\nreviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e . \\nthe truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies . \\nwhen pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman . \\nthe same goes for the thin red line , as well . \\nwhen it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg\\'s saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever . \\ncritics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards . \\nthis is why i think pleasantville was underrated . \\nif the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it\\'s long been on the video store shelves . \\nsure , it wasn\\'t perfect , and it wasn\\'t very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history . \\nwith the exception of don knotts as the annoying \" tv repairman \" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm\\'s tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50\\'s sitcom \" pleasantville \" to escape from his feuding parents . \\nhis twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes . \\nbut what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90\\'s terms such as \" like \" , \" whatever \" , and \" cool \" make her sound like the total dimwit she\\'s supposed to be . \\nthe twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote . \\ntheir new parents , played by william h . macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way . \\ntheir new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville . \\nafter the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form . \\nit\\'s just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don\\'t want it to end . \\n \" mary sue \" has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color . \\nsoon we learn that these people don\\'t know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color . \\nthis eventually sparks a racial war between the \" coloreds \" and the \" black & whites . \" \\nentertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , \" none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show . . . \" \\nyes , the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent . \\nbut the racial setting-intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom-certainly classifies as deep , considering it\\'s what i least expected . \\ngary ross did not try to create an intelligent , award masterpiece-he just tries to convey moral messages within his work . \\ntake for example big and dave , his past films . \\nbig-be careful what you wish for . \\ndave-good or bad lying is still lying . \\ndid these movies win big awards ? \\nno , but they won the heart of millions . \\npleasantville could have done that too , if it wasn\\'t for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films . \\npleasantville : a- ad2am \" i almost lost my nose . . . and \\ni like it . \\ni like breathing through it . \" \\n-jack

\\nthere is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw , who could have helped the film along . \\nhowever , overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes , so

you can kill him . \" \\nstarring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood . \\nrated r . \\ndouble jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that\\'s also one of the year\\'s most enjoyable . \\nit\\'s an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it . \\nthere is not a moment here when the events on screen don\\'t have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops . \\nit has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that\\'s probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones . \\nnot even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake . \\nwe meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4 . they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin\\' sex , they go to sleep . \\nlibby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood . \\nshe follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up . \\nat that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested . \\nher lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling . \\nher friend adopts her son and she goes to prison . \\nonce in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend . \\nher friend gives her son the phone . \\nnick walks in the room . \\nlittle matty screams \" daddy ! \" \\nthe phone goes dead . \\nlibby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn\\'t even dead . \\nshe gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can\\'t convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can\\'t touch her . \\nafter a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole . \\nshe is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) . \\nshe sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated . \\nshe winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son\\'s \" adopter \" . \\ndouble jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false . \\nthe law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances . \\nit\\'s not like it matters . \\nthis is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious . \\nit\\'s silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don\\'t question . \\nin some films , plausibility is everything . \\ndouble jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does . \\njudd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role . \\nthis is her breakout box-office performance , and she is terrific . \\nshe brings some emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces . \\ntommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone-faced wit . \\nthankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film\\'s story . \\nthis is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that . \\nthe sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book . \\nafter all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops , deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system , it\\'s great to see a movie that doesn\\'t so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure . \\ndouble jeopardy is really good , but it isn\\'t the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards . \\nit\\'s one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off , otherwise , your brain will be busy ruining your experience . \\nthis is a thriller that isn\\'t concerned with being smart or plausible . \\ninstead it diverts all attention to the action , which , this year , is second to none . \\n',\n"," b'glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war . \\nbroderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle . \\nshaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society . \\nthe letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory . \\nas the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces . \\nlike private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces . \\nshaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck . \\nsoon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort . \\nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . \\nthe film periodically jumps between shaw\\'s point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . \\nthe movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . \\nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . \\nhe is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . \\nhis bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability . \\nwashington provides much of the film\\'s intensity and emotional power . \\nin one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army . \\nwhen he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . \\nit makes your blood boil . \\nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington\\'s cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \\nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn\\'t deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \\nfreeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \\nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \\nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \\ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman\\'s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . \\nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw\\'s close childhood friends . \\nsearles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him \" snow flake . \" \\nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . \\nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \\nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . \\nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . \\nthey are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . \\nto make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \\neventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \\nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \\nbroderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . \\nunfortunately , however , broderick\\'s uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \\nin an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \\nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \\nthe film places too much weight on broderick\\'s character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \\nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . \\nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \\nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \\nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \\nto the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it\\'s just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \\nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \\nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \\nin one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \\neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \\na couple of the movie\\'s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \\nthe regiment\\'s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \\nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north\\'s victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \\n',\n"," b'there are scenes in \" the big hit \" that are so awful , they simply defy description . \\nthe movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made \" last action hero \" ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through . \\npresumably , \" the big hit \" is an action-comedy , a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off . \\nmovies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence . \\n \" lethal weapon 2 \" ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny . \\nunfortunately , in \" the big hit , \" it seems that comedy is the main motive , and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs . \\nunfortunately , there are no laughs . \\nthe movie resembles some of the goofy , throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films , but it doesn\\'t benefit from chan\\'s incredible stunts and goofy , charismatic presence . \\ninstead , we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg , who must have considered himself invincible after his critically-acclaimed performance in last year\\'s \" boogie nights . \" \\nhowever , if he wants to maintain a decent career , he had better start selecting his projects more carefully - movies like this are a sure-fire recipe for a long career in the straight-to-video market . \\nwahlberg plays melvin smiley , an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman ( see \" grosse pointe blank \" for the same character , much better developed ) . \\nthe movie wants us to think , \" gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral implications , and yet he can\\'t stand for anyone not to like him . \" \\nthe fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money . \\nhis constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best , and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst . \\nmelvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris ( avery brooks ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includes cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) . \\none day , melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom . \\nhowever , not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie ( inside joke , get it ? ) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris\\' goddaughter . \\nso , when paris finds out she\\'s been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it . \\nnot knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper . \\nof course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin . \\nalong the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by \" jurassic park , \" and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she\\'s barely pushing fifteen ) . \\nwhat the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara-kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises . \\nnot to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of \" king kong lives , \" which is two weeks overdue . \\nthis mess of a movie was helmed by che-kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( \" face/off \" ) , who also served as executive producer . \\nwoo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films . \\nwong , who directed such films as \" rock\\'n\\'roll cop \" back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy . \\nmaybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they\\'re not here , at least in the manner wong handles them . \\nmany of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey . \\nin addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey\\'s script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet-style dialogue . \\nwhat he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is \" it\\'s all love \" ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco\\'s stuttering , black-wannabe assistant . \\nthe irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale , which can pretty much describe the film as a whole . \\n',\n"," b'the premise of turbulence is i\\'m sure very familiar to us all . \\nwe\\'ve seen it before in passenger 57 , executive decision , and countless other flicks that are good in there own way . \\nyou know , terrorists take over a plane , ask the police on the ground for what they what and so on . \\nturbulence starts out with a \" convict \" ray liotta being accused of a crime . \\nyou think there is no way he could have done it , he\\'s so open and kind . \\nhe is taken in and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la . \\nthis is already a problem . \\nthere is no way that convicts would be transported on the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on . \\nanyway , it is christmas eve and everyone is waiting to get to la and spend christmas eve there . \\nwell , convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial \" tracks \" and liotta , still as calm as ever , takes the other convict out . \\nhe also has eyes for lauren holly , a flight attendent , and seems to grow closer to her . \\n \" the plot stops here \" \\ni didn\\'t like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie i\\'ve ever seen . \\nat one point , mr . liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining ( i\\'m serious ! ) . \\nit was like they stole for every other movie down to a \" t \" . \\nthe only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts . \\ndon\\'t even bother ! \\n',\n"," b'the bond series is an island in the film world ; where else would we look forward to cliches , and all of the other things that occur in most of these films ? \\nwhere else would pure escapism , a vulnerable hero , the \" talking villains , \" blatant product placement , predictable action sequences , and lots of promiscuity be hoped for instead of a significant change ? \\ni don\\'t understand it myself , but that\\'s what the bond series is based on . \\nfor ( i think ) 18 films , we\\'ve mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films ) . \\nbut even i , a king of cynicism , can\\'t bitch about it . \\nand \" tomorrow never dies , \" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no exception . \\nthank god ! \\nthe plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it . \\ninstead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch-esque media mogul/psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white-haired cru cut , and always talking like he\\'s out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war . \\nno , this is not \" wag the dog \" - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it . . . in \\ncomes bond . \\njames is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire . . . and \\nco-star of \" supercop , \" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one ) . \\nthe two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two . \\nluckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova-ness until the finale . \\nthank god again . \\nin every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids-cautionary dalton ) , and he doesn\\'t spoil this one ( though we never see them , of course - i mean , they need to stay around a pg-13 rating ) . \\nthere\\'s always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost-cameo by teri hatcher as carver\\'s wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning . \\nyes , teri\\'s very attractive , but she seems kind of dull . \\nof course , it\\'s not really her fault ; her part is under-written , and she\\'s only in a small part of it . \\noh well . \\nand there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains . \\nthis time we get a tall , arian-looking ( not to mention robert shaw in \" from russia with love \" -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really ) . \\nand for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point . \\nthe government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench ) . \\nand for no reason whatsoever , except \\'cause he was so good in \" goldeneye , \" joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no reason for being there , and is this time more annoying . \\nagain , oh well . \\nthe action sequences are not a let-down , although sometimes go on too long . \\nthey pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam . . . the \\nplot\\'s not really essential ) . \\nthey\\'re more high-tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig . \\nso what if they\\'re distracting ; they\\'re supposed to be ! \\nthe acting , from most around is great . \\nyeoh is , actually , one of the better bond girls , mainly because she\\'s so unique . \\nthe better bond girls are more independent , and have a certain wily-ness to them . \\npussy galore , with her homoerotic undertones and all , is one of the best , and diana rigg , who married bond at the end of \" on her majesty\\'s secret service \" only to be killed , added some emotional depth . \\nyeoh is notable since she\\'s so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan . \\npryce is an awesome villain , being slimy and lovable at the same time . \\nand brosnan is , once again , the mack daddy . \\nthe bond series is built on cliches , mainly because they\\'re so fun and add to the escapism . \\nif you can remember the dalton years , and they\\'re serious direction , you remember how unsuccessful they were , both financially and aesthetically . \\nthe series would falter if bogged down with too much plot , too many themes , and too much characterization . \\ni don\\'t really understand it myself , yet i\\'m one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states . \\nhaving seen all of them more than once ( yes , i\\'ve seen this twice already ) , you can tell i adore them . \\nwhile it\\'s not one of the best , like \" goldfinger \" or \" from russia with love , \" \" tomorrow never dies \" is nonetheless a truly awesome installment , even if not being as fully amazing as some of the better ones . \\n',\n"," b'much ado about nothing . \\nah , how sweet the irony ! \\nit\\'s accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they

think that \" the bridge on the river kwai \" doesn\\'t deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute\\'s list of the 100 greatest american movies . \\nand i think that \" 12 angry men \" , \" witness for the prosecution \" and \" paths of glory \" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 . \\nbut i can\\'t deny the importance of \" the bridge on the river kwai \" - cinematically and in its contents . \\nthe film is set in burma in 1943 . \\na batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . \\nbut the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn\\'t work as simple workmen . \\nstruggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . \\nafterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . \\nhe considers it an opportunity to raise his men\\'s morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . \\nbut the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . . \\na flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . \\nthey are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . \\nand the film doesn\\'t consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in \" paths of glory \" . \\nlean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . \\nthis is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . \\nin this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person . \\nthe audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson\\'s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not . \\nthe spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . \\n ( the plot by-passes these risks . ) \\nthat means , the picture isn\\'t perfect . \\nbut it has a lot of virtues as well . \\n \" the bridge on the river kwai \" shows the \" madness \" of war and what it can produce in people\\'s minds . \\nit shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . \\nand lean\\'s film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . \\nthese points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . \\ndavid lean\\'s direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect . \\nhis film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown . \\nthe film is also well-photographed and has an apt score . \\nalec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . \\nthe other actors deliver fine performances as well . \\ni like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses . \\n ( c ) karl

first . \\nto be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world\\'s worst shot . \\nmeanwhile connor develops luke-skywalker-like powers of laser beam deflection . \\nas for \" bad guys , \" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist . \\ntwo assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems . \\nno more assassins are sent . \\nkatana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor . \\nhas he no more assassins ? \\nhas he no better ? \\nwhy was the rebellion crushed so easily then ? \\nmichael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan ) . \\nhe seems like a cartoon character and really isn\\'t that evil , just stupid and violent . \\nwe see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents . \\nyet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn\\'t have been amiss with larry , curly and mo . \\nso much for plot and characters . \\nthe music is atrocious . \\nit is at best intrusive and at worst annoying . \\nbring back queen . \\nthere was an audible sigh ( of relief ? ) \\nwhen connor played a queen track in a juke box . \\ni believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release . \\nthe acting is at best flat , except for mr . connery . \\nlambert is uninteresting and when he delivered \" there can be only one \" this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander . \\nmichael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable . \\nso why 2/10 ? \\nvisually the film is interesting at all times . \\nit has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning . \\nadd to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself ? \\nhis lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey -- * i\\'d * have done it for 12 million . \\noh , and i agree with a previous reviewer , she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film . \\nincidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard . \\n',\n"," b\"when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy , the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass . \\ntoss out your usual objectivity , ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it , forget how unbearable it was to sit through , and find some meaningless way to compliment it . \\nthis , of course , will be of no service to your readers , but at least you'll avoid the hate mail from the movie's fans . \\nthus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot ) . \\ndirected by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez . \\npaulina was a maid in vicky's household when vicky was young . \\ni got to learn the film's background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present . \\nfor those without such context , the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film . \\nthe acting is amateurish , the story is maudlin , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie . \\ngrainy and overexposed , the movie , shot on 16mm film and videotape , has little to recommend it . \\nconfusingly composed , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story . \\nquite bloody at times , the story , full of horrific images , seems designed to shock and repulse us . \\nwhy else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old paulina ? \\nanother scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her . \\nin retaliation , she bites off part of his finger . \\nthis covers the both of them in a bucket of blood . \\nthe passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner . \\none , for example , sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body . \\nthe lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten . \\ncertainly she had to endure a miserable life . \\nbut that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good . \\ni felt trapped in the theater watching it . \\nonly the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable . \\npaulina runs 1 : 28 . \\nthe film is in spanish with english subtitles . \\nit is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers . \\n\",\n"," b'the best thing -- in fact , the only good thing -- i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l . a . confidential again . \\nor go rent body heat , to see william hurt do some real noir . \\nor even -- god help me -- palmetto . \\nalex proyas\\'s new movie screams atmosphere . \\ni screamed , too , \" get me out of this theater ! \" \\nnew line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and doesn\\'t have any way to get it back . \\ni paid $4 . 25 for a matinee screening and don\\'t have any way to get my money back , either . \\nyou\\'ll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie . \\ni will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it\\'s always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras . \\ni\\'ve got news for you fellows -- i don\\'t care how hard you worked , or how visually stunning this movie looks -- you wasted your time and mine , working on a movie without a plot , without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go , without a soul or a reason to care . \\nthe movie starts out oh-so-promising . \\njohn murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago . \\nthere is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory . \\nthe phone rings : it\\'s a sinister-sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life . \\nall well and good , right ? \\nwrong . \\napparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot . \\n ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood . ) \\nso , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it\\'s a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible . \\nit\\'s as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca . \\nno , wait , that\\'s not fair to casablanca . \\nit\\'s more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won\\'t be getting off the island in this episode . \\n>from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here ) . \\nthe characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that\\'s what moves the plot . \\nwhat we\\'re left with is a string of unanswered questions that don\\'t make any sense . \\nwe\\'re given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed . \\nwe\\'re given a hero who can \" tune \" into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it\\'s convenient to the plot . \\nwe\\'re given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere \\nusually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part \" isn\\'t given much to do . \" \\nin this movie , no one is given anything to do . \\nsewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn\\'t remember anything , and plays it like . . . \\num . . . \\na man who doesn\\'t remember anything . \\nthe aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they\\'re evil -- and there\\'s a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel . \\nsutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he\\'s in league with the aliens . \\nto its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting . \\nwilliam hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city . \\njennifer connelly , playing sewell\\'s love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit . \\nbut instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they\\'re almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is . \\nthe problem with dark city is this : it\\'s a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir . \\nthe essence of film noir isn\\'t , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap-brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner . \\ndark city has not one bit of intrigue , moral ambiguity , suspense , or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics . \\ndark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic . \\nit\\'s an exceptionlly well-made and intricately designed piece of flotsam , sailing around and around the middle of the ocean , going nowhere . \\n',\n"," b\"for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers . \\napparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing , since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it . \\nin other words , it's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid . \\nmadonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp . \\nshe's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover . \\nalready two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men . \\nwhat's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well . \\nmadonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition . \\n ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy . \\nthis movie leave no scummy stone unturned . ) \\nanyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality . \\nhow do we know this ? \\nbecause his character is set up with the token wife and kids . \\nhow obvious is it that he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ? \\nand get kicked out of the house ? \\nand get welcomed back anyway ? \\ndon't skip to the end yet ; we're just getting warmed up . \\ndafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie . \\nmost of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs . \\ndon't ask . \\nanother thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it's insanely dull . \\nwhat's worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes . \\nthe stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes . \\nthe thriller business itself is ridiculous -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor . \\nand the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ? \\n-- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in . \\nthe director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f . everyone has to eat , i guess , but this isn't a meal ticket , it's leftovers . \\n\",\n"," b'tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \\nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it\\'s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \\nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \\nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \\ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \\nit\\'s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \\nart ! \" ) , \\nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \\nbecause we\\'re constantly made aware that we\\'re watching a play or a movie , it\\'s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer\\'s ideas . \\nthey\\'re not real , sympathetic , or believable . \\ni\\'m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \\ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \\none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \\nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \\nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \\nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \\nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \\nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn\\'t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \\ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \\nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren\\'t bilingual ) . \\nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it\\'s different , ( b ) it\\'s not like anything they\\'ve seen before , and ( c ) it\\'s pretentious . \\nfor everyone else , it\\'s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \\n',\n"," b'whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films , the end result is always a mess of a script , acting , directing , and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40 . \\nthe latest movie morass from hollywood , the crew , appeared equally destined to fail , a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship . \\nthe scary thing is that it\\'s actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month . \\nthe crew works for several reasons . \\nthe clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie , following four \" past their prime \" wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach . \\nthe wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their \" golden paradise \" by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property . \\nthe four mobsters , bobby bartellemeo ( richard dreyfuss ) , joey \" bats \" pistella ( burt reynolds ) , mike \" the brick \" donatelli ( dan hedaya ) , and tony \" mouth \" donato ( seymour cassel ) decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home . \\nthis \" simple plan \" suddenly goes screwy , of course , and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris ( jennifer tilly ) who wants her stepmother killed , a paranoid latin drug lord who\\'s convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him , and a rat with its tail on fire . \\nthe crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men . \\ninstead of concentrating on bobby\\'s search for his daughter , the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys , balancing the production . \\nthe acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya , seymour cassel , and the great , great burt reynolds are brought out by each character\\'s uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle . \\na strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend/cop/partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs . \\nthe film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner , emmy award-winning director of the wonder years . \\nthe quick script written by barry fanaro , screenwriter of kingpin , is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit . \\nthe crew is a prime example of how simple and dry-witted a comedy can get these days . \\nthe great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids , phallus symbols in the head , or grandmothers giving head in a spa . \\nin the steady flow of \" extreme \" comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main , it\\'s the elder statesmen like dreyfuss , reynolds , and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice - a decent script and good acting . \\n',\n"," b'this is the movie that could single-handedly bring \" mystery science theater 3000 \" out of cancellation . \\nit\\'s one of those movies that\\'s so bad it\\'s absolutely hilarious , due in no small part to its big star , supermodel cindy crawford . \\nif you only remember one thing about fair game , it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues . \\nif you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l . a . , you\\'ll change your mind when you see fair game . \\nireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition . \\nin a real casting coup , crawford plays a super-intelligent lawyer ( in a jogging bra , of course ) . \\nwe all know this is a stretch , the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day . \\nnonetheless , someone out there thought she\\'d make a good lawyer , but we\\'re reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes . \\nand for you horny teenage boys out there , you actually get to see her topless for two seconds in the dark . . . \\ncome to think of it , that may have been a body double . \\ncindy crawford isn\\'t black , is she ? \\nlike i said , crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her . \\nbilly baldwin ( or is it stephen ? \\nalec ? \\nadam ? \\nkim basinger ? ) is the police detective who has to save her life , time after time , chase after chase , explosion after explosion . \\nthere\\'s absolutely nothing original about this movie . \\nit\\'s every cop show of the 70\\'s mixed with every action thriller of the 80\\'s and every technology- exploitation movie of the 90\\'s . \\nthree decades of crap all in one place , driven further into the ground by crawford\\'s complete lack of acting talent . \\nand it\\'s all completely predictable . \\nyou know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them , you know when the \" sexual tension \" will finally end up in them consummating the relationship , you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movie\\'s going to suck from the first scene . \\nthe plot isn\\'t really explained until the end . \\nall we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer . \\nin the words of one of the villains , \" we even know what size pantyhose she wears . \" \\n ( yeah , you and every 14-year-old boy in america . ) \\nhe goes on to add , \" we know more about her than she does . \" \\n ( _that_ i find very easy to believe . ) \\ni hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes , because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones ( \" if it weren\\'t for me , you\\'d still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba ! \" ) \\nbecause , you see , fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting , but also some seriously bad dialogue . \\nit all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn\\'t supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh . \\none more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief . \\nwould you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like \" i\\'m very interested in _hard_ware \" and other crap about playing with his joystick ? \\ni wouldn\\'t , but not because i\\'m a computer nerd . \\nit\\'s just not funny . \\ncrawford\\'s only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords\\' body . . . \\nor was it jack lord\\'s body ? \\ni\\'ll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie . \\nthe boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft . \\ncrawford says woodenly , \" that was my client\\'s boat you just blew up . \\ni\\'m filing a lawsuit against you . \\nyou\\'re in big trouble , \" or something to that effect , and baldwin replies smugly , \" what do i have to do to get out of it ? \" \\nthey of course begin making out and the credits roll . \\ni\\'m not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how , if they\\'d really wanted to go for a bad closing line they would have had baldwin say , \" you think i could settle out of court ? \" \\nbut i will tell you that , if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her , you quote the final line of the movie to that person : \" what do i have to do to get out of it ? \" \\nserving america for over 1/50th of a century ! \\n',\n"," b'capsule : dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes , and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones . \\nbasic instinct\\'s worst crime is that it\\'s not just a bad movie , but in many ways , an incompetent one as well . \\nit\\'s stupid in itself , and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is . \\nit\\'s supposed to be a thriller , but the plot is dead on its feet , and ultimately arbitrary ; it\\'s only put into the movie to jerk us around . \\nit\\'s also supposed to be sexy , but it\\'s instead got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures . \\nit\\'s a ripoff . \\nthe story opens with a rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm . \\nthe biggest suspect is an authoress , catherine tramell ( sharon stone ) , who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged . \\nor maybe it\\'s the work of a copycat ? \\nthese and other plot threads get fed to the detective who\\'s on the case ( michael douglas ) , who has a few problems himself . \\nlike we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor . \\nwe can measure with a stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance . \\njoe eszterhas has written the screenplay , and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge : the killer\\'s identity is kept a secret until the movie\\'s final shot . \\nthis isn\\'t in itself a problem -- the problem is that up until that point , we\\'ve been given nothing to work with . \\nevery clue in the movie -- every clue -- is ambiguous . \\nthe whole thriller aspect of the movie is a shill . \\nred herrings , dead plot threads , violence , and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets . \\nthey add up to zip , because they\\'re not happening to people we care about . \\ndouglas\\'s character is foulmouthed and bitter and that\\'s it ; stone\\'s character has an iron-on smile that never changes ; the rest are forgettable . \\nwhen we don\\'t even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie , who cares what happens in it ? \\nespecially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying , but in many ways inexplicable ? \\n ( a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters : \" if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know , or would * care * to know , just leave ! \" ) \\none of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone\\'s life , but as a kind of kink -- something to thrill men with . \\ni despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment ; are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a big-budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism ? \\n',\n"," b'plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . \\nthey get into an accident . \\none of the guys dies , but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares . \\nwhat\\'s the deal ? \\nwatch the movie and \" sorta \" find out . . . \\ncritique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , but presents it in a very bad package . \\nwhich is what makes this review an even harder one to write , since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway & memento ) , but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films , and these folks just didn\\'t snag this one correctly . \\nthey seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , but executed it terribly . \\nso what are the problems with the movie ? \\nwell , its main problem is that it\\'s simply too jumbled . \\nit starts off \" normal \" but then downshifts into this \" fantasy \" world in which you , as an audience member , have no idea what\\'s going on . \\nthere are dreams , there are characters coming back from the dead , there are others who look like the dead , there are strange apparitions , there are disappearances , there are a looooot of chase scenes , there are tons of weird things that happen , and most of it is simply not explained . \\nnow i personally don\\'t mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again , i get kind of fed up after a while , which is this film\\'s biggest problem . \\nit\\'s obviously got this big secret to hide , but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes . \\nand do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? \\nnot really . \\nthe sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point , so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense , but it still didn\\'t the make the film all that more entertaining . \\ni guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is \" into it \" even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding . \\ni mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! ! \\nokay , we get it . . . there \\nare people chasing her and we don\\'t know who they are . \\ndo we really need to see it over and over again ? \\nhow about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? \\napparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows . \\nthere might\\'ve been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , but i guess \" the suits \" decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense . \\nthe actors are pretty good for the most part , although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood . \\nbut my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller , who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character\\'s unraveling . \\noverall , the film doesn\\'t stick because it doesn\\'t entertain , it\\'s confusing , it rarely excites and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . \\noh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . . it\\'s \\njust packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids . \\nit also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . \\nwhatever . . . skip

more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo the masses , enticing them with big stars , big effects , and a big setting -- but no heart . \\nit is difficult to criticise the actors , because they do everything the movie demands of them . \\nsadly , this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing \" pearl harbor \" with his left . \\nthe plot here is pure cliche , and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop . \\nthere is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states , and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii . \\ninstead , there is just an assembly-line love triangle , some empty patriotic rhetoric , and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders ( when one intones , \" i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant \" , i nearly fell out of my seat ) . \\nto the movie\\'s credit , it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself , an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges

movie . \\nthis film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare , and be grounded in reality . \\nthe plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident , a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city . \\nthey need fresh air to get some perspective , maybe to start over . \\nromance begins to brew , however , as one of the locals , played by an international superstar in rugged clothing , sparks things up , ( especially at a country-western slow dance ) . \\nit stars a rising young starlet , helms a good cast , and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood . \\nyou accept . \\nyou jump at the opportunity to see , what you believe to be , _the horse whisperer_ . \\nbut , poor moviegoer , you have been conned . \\nalas , you find yourself watching , incredulously , _hope floats_ . \\noh , woe . \\nyour hope has sunk . \\nwhy was this movie made ? \\nwhy was it released ? \\nit is a travesty on nearly every level , and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved . \\nat the hands of a better script , the film could have been a gem . \\nbut it is clueless as to what it is about , and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers . \\n_hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy , who , after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less ) , takes her daughter and drives back to her home , helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands , ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife ) . \\nbirdy\\'s nephew , travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_\\'s cameron finley ) , is under her custody , and in one of the film\\'s many failed in-jokes , is always seen wearing a different halloween costume . \\nwhat is the point of this ? \\ndoes it make any sense ? \\nis it supposed to be funny ? \\nthe point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric , but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child . \\nall of this undercuts the plot , of which there is none . \\nthere are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion . \\nthere\\'s the scene where birdy , who used to be the prom queen , is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked , for a job . \\nthere\\'s the scene where birdy dances with her father , in the hospital for alzheimer\\'s . \\nand then there\\'s the sentimental scenes with justin , played by harry connick jr . , who is taking a liking to her again , showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch . \\nand during each of these scenes , i was sidetracked by my earlier question . \\nwhat sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume , a kermit costume , a cowboy costume ( with whip ) , and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner ? \\nwhat sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life ? \\noutside of this , there are other sure signs of screenwriters block . \\nwhen the daughter stands up to the bully at school . \\nwhen birdy almost loses her job . \\nwhen the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to cheer someone up . \\nwhen someone dies . \\nwhen the daughter cries , ( no , wails ) in exasperation that her father is not coming back . \\nin a movie like this , you notice the strings being pushed , and you sit there , comatose , hoping it will end . \\nwho can survive such a debacle ? \\ni worry for bullock\\'s career , which has been running on auto-pilot for the last few years . \\nshe has an attitude , a solid perkiness , and can drive a bus--but she can\\'t handle the emotional scenes , much less hold a southern accent . \\nharry connick , jr . is worse--stick with singing , or get some acting lessons , please ! \\ngena rowlands is the best part of the film . \\nbut she\\'s such a good actress , that it staggers the mind that she\\'s weighed down by such lukewarm material here . \\nit would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes\\' great films is known for this film . \\ntwo notes to forest whittaker : ( 1 ) cut the slow-motion sequences . \\nthere are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick . \\nhave you done so , you could have shaved

their had been strong protests against the release of red corner \\x16 and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws . \\nbut if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american . \\nor more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence . \\nthis is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor \\x16 but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role . \\nif a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work . \\nalthough gere\\x12s performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect \\x16 and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself . \\nthis is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear ( with the sensational edward norton ) , the jackal ( with bruce willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts ) . \\nin red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear \\x16 bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind . \\nit is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail . \\nit doesn\\x12t take long from the film\\x12s beginning for jack moore\\x12s charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room \\x16 drunk and cheerful . \\nyet instead of a hangover , poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch . \\nhe is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison . \\nhis cell , food and rights \\x16 all terrible . \\nnow trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy , lawyer shen yuelin ( bai ling ) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder . \\njack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that \\x13they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family . \\x14 \\nas the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous \\x16 ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered . \\nred corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit you\\x12re way through all of its minutes . \\nwhat should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act . \\nthis is not to say that the film does not have its moments \\x16 there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created \\x16 telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption . \\nbut what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place \\x16 perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch . \\nif you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible . \\nit is upon the film\\x12s execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before . \\nif that wasn\\x12t bad enough , red corner\\x12s dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions . \\nshen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself . \\ntaking itself far too seriously , red corner is not half the film it intends to be . \\nalthough it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the film\\x12s main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story which isn\\x12t that meritorious anyway . \\nwhilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor , i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again . \\nmartin vail\\x05where are you ? \\n',\n"," b'a backdrop of new year\\'s eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie . \\nthe decor possibilities are endless - disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic , big hair was worth

of the me decade , something is inherently wrong with \" 200 cigarettes . \" \\na better title for this nostalgic mess would be \" 50 missed opportunities . \" \\nwhat is it that makes this retro-comedy such a downer ? \\nit\\'s certainly not the cast , which includes enough hot , young talent for several movies . \\nthere\\'s courtney love , cementing her reputation as a serious actress ; christina ricci , hot off her shoulda-been-nominated turn in \" the opposite of sex \" ; paul rudd , who gets even more appealing with every role ; kate hudson , inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn ; and affleck brothers ben and casey , two of the best things about \" good will hunting . \" \\nperhaps the question is this : what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project ? \\nmaybe it looked good on paper . \\n \" 200 cigarettes \" is composed of a series of vignettes , as various characters make their way through new york\\'s festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica ( martha plimpton , all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper ) . \\namong the potential guests are likeable cad kevin ( rudd ) and his best friend lucy ( love ) , busy bickering over his recent break-up , and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ( ben affleck ) who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick-up lines . \\nmore subplots - _many_ more - dot the big picture , but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light . \\nall the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick\\'s cube . \\nricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals ( the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants ) out to have a high time in the big city . \\ninfamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several-scene cameo . \\nhudson , as a pretty-in-pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies\\' man ( jay mohr ) , trips , pukes and gets smeared with dog poop . \\nare we laughing yet ? \\nthe film boils down to a mixture of the good , the bad and the gaudy , with the latter two overtaking the former . \\ngame performances - especially by love , rudd and plimpton - are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus , here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle . \\ntoo many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each

his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well . \\nwith early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining . \\nhowever , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere . \\nthis $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment . \\nconsidering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing . \\nthe film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors . \\nhowever , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft . \\nalong with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . ) \\nthey investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens . \\nunfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere . \\nthe film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier . \\nthe film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on . \\nthe actors and directing don't help , either . \\nhoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie . \\nstone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman . \\nthe only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere . \\nbut he's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone . \\nthe same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through . \\nthe director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action . \\nthe drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 ) \\nthe writing doesn't help much , either . \\nalthough crichton is great with plots , he's terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud . \\nthe speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent . \\npractically every line is just stating the obvious . \\nnone of it is smart . \\nalso , where the hell did the budget go ? \\nthe sphere itself is impressive , and there's a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess . \\nthere's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget . \\ni assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would . \\nbut the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid . \\nfinally , the film has no idea what genre to be . \\nlevison can't handle his own plot . \\nit leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller . \\nand , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . ) \\nit's not all that bad though . \\nthe plot is all right , there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit . \\nbut overall , sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie . \\nnot really worth seeing . \\noverall rating= review by david wilcock \\n\",\n"," b'the \" disney stick-to-what-you-do-best \" rule states that disney\\'s animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at

dalmations ? \\ni\\'m still trying to forget ) . \\nthat rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget , an insulting , despicable and , worst of all , expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children\\'s film . \\nit will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults , even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes . \\nit\\'s films

matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career takes a nosedive to hell with his \" role \" as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart

murderers . \\nin the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor\\'s father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown\\'s worst nemesis . \\nclaw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d . l . \\nhughley ) to save humanity from his wrath . \\nstate of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere . \\nhad they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect . \\nwhat we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing . \\npart of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie . \\ncan kids really admire a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams \" hey ! \\nyou ran a stop sign ! \" \\nwhile hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ? \\ni think that today\\'s children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra-cool . \\nthey ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt . \\nin addition to the more complex complaints above , there\\'s also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible . \\nthere\\'s no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i\\'ve seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line . \\nthere\\'s a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that\\'s irrelevant ) running in

omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ? \\nattention movie : explain yourself ! \\ni\\'m sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much . \\ni can\\'t buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to . \\nknowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically \" wills \" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school . \\nshe\\'s given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ? \\nlois lane\\'s sister , lucy . \\nok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we\\'re getting really contrived now . \\nwhat follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . . \\ncomplete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) . \\nbest moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . \\nat this point i\\'m rapidly wondering why i\\'m bothering with this nonsense . \\nthere is some credit to give to the film however . \\none lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an \" evil \" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its \" prey \" is very well done . \\nalso , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . \\nhart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara\\'s love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film\\'s more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some \" menacing \" bumper cars ) . \\nthen there were numerous little things that bothered me . \\nthe flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . . \\nit\\'s all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . \\ninstead of having her look like she\\'s flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be \" graceful \" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . \\nalso , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? \\na pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a \" wacky \" demise . \\nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye\\'s , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . \\nfinally , just one word : monsters . \\nfaye dunaway and peter o\\'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o\\'toole overacts he\\'s entertaining and when dunaway does it she\\'s annoying ( her character actually says the line \" seize them ! \" \\nat one point ) . \\ndunaway\\'s henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty\\'s otis character from the first two superman movies . \\nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she\\'s written to be , as she\\'s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . \\nbelievability aside though , it\\'s still annoying . \\nnow despite all this negativity ( and i\\'m not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! \\nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . \\nyet i\\'m still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . \\nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . \\nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . \\nextras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and \" special project consultant \" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . \\nthe transfer on this international version is incredible . . . \\nyou\\'d think you were watching a new release . \\nimages are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . \\nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn\\'t much that can be done about that ( unless you\\'re obsessive like george lucas ) . \\nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you\\'ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams\\' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films\\' golan-globus production ) . \\nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . \\nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there\\'s no dead air on the track . \\nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . \\nalthough , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn\\'t get that response . \\nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the \" almost \" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . \\ngreat detail is given about superman\\'s proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . \\nas it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . \\nfor the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy \" whimsical fantasy \" nonsense . \\nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . \\nagain , for the sake of brevity , i won\\'t even get into that one . \\nanchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . \\ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . \\ndisc two features the never before seen director\\'s cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . \\nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don\\'t add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o\\'toole\\'s screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . \\nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won\\'t care . \\none question though . . . \\nshouldn\\'t the director\\'s commentary be on the director\\'s cut of the film ? \\ni\\'d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \\ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \\nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \\ni knew the film wasn\\'t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \\nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \\ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \\nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \\nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \\nugh , i give up . \\ni\\'m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \\nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \\n[pg] \\n',\n"," b'if you have ever seen fox tv\\'s special car chase programs , you\\'ll have a good idea about the content of ronin , the new action \" thriller \" from director john frankenheimer . \\nthe film involves a mysterious briefcase , that several groups of terrorist want to get their hands on . \\nan irish women , dierdre ( played by the truman show\\'s natascha mcelhone ) , hires a group of mercenaries to assist her in getting the briefcase . \\namong the people she hires are sam ( robert de niro ) , vincent ( jean reno ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsg ? rd from good will hunting ) . \\ndierdre\\'s groups assignment is too seize the briefcase while the current owners are transporting it . \\nthey accomplish this task , but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcase is soon on the run again . \\nthe briefcase stays on the run , as the movie leads the viewer through several plot twists that are badly executed . \\nthe writer seemed to be attempting to make a smart action movie , but failed to understand that just because there are surprises , it doesn\\'t add too the credibility of a senseless script . \\nthe plot twists get no reaction because they come at a time where no one cares what is going on , after the apparent climax of the film . \\nbut to add to the excitement , as i mentioned earlier , there are endless car chase scenes . \\nthey are unrealistic and fail to add anything to the story . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong , i love car chases , but they were overdone and too long here . \\nwe never do find out what\\'s in the briefcase , but i doubt anyone cares by the time they finish sitting through this two hour long attempted thriller . \\n',\n"," b'almost a full decade before steven spielberg\\'s saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both \" anti war \" and \" pro-soldier \" , john irvin\\'s hamburger hill proved it could . \\nlost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone\\'s platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as \" too militaristic \" . \\nit\\'s hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons \" chose to show up \" for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what \" the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn \" became to wwii movies . \\nhamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch . \\nthere is a scene that will have graying anti-war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears . \\nand the climactic final assault on the \" hill \" in question is visually confusing . \\ngristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered . \\nand in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and \" newbie \" , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat . \\nthe acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b . vance as doc--in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as \" seaman jones \" in mctiernan\\'s red october . \\nif you\\'ve seen private ryan , you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill--if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg\\'s vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach . \\n',\n"," b'capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . \\nto end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . \\nthe somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone\\'s taste . \\n , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) \\nmore than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . \\nthis may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . \\nduring world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . \\nthis led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . \\nwhen the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . \\nminimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . \\nwhile the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% . \\nthe best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . \\nthat railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . \\nthe best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . \\nand just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . \\nin the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . \\nfilmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . \\nthere are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . \\ncertainly there was david lean\\'s the bridge on the river kwai . \\nthere were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it . \\nthen there were tv series \" a town like alice \" and \" tenko . \" \\nlest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . \\nit is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . \\nthe film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . \\nthe story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . \\nit turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . \\nbeating and torture are commonplace events . \\nmen already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . \\nhowever , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . \\nso goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine . \\nthis is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . \\nthe japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group\\'s norms is all that gives a life meaning . \\nconformity is purpose . \\nbefore the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . \\nif this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . \\nif the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . \\nit is neither . \\nit is a stirring and believable account of camp life . \\nthe color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . \\nthis serves a double purpose for cunningham . \\nit gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . \\nit also creates a distancing effect . \\nthe only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . \\nthis is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . \\ni rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n"," b'the first image in \" final fantasy : the spirits within \" is a computer-animated close-up of a human eye . \\nit\\'s a beautiful piece of work , remarkably detailed and quite convincing . \\nwhen the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye , however , things change . \\nthe young woman has mesmerizing hair , although it hangs too artfully ? even by movie standards ? to be believed . \\nthe facial features are more detailed than any computer-animation seen to date , but the result is more reminiscent of a very well-crafted doll than anything human . \\nshe is pretty , but bland , and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person . \\nall the characters in \" final fantasy \" are like that . \\nof the core group , the younger white men and women are all athletic , attractive and indistinct , like applicants for a tv reality show . \\nthe black man is taller and burlier , and the aging scholar is bald , with wrinkles and a beard . \\nnone of them appear to be based on individuals ; they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist . \\nit gets worse when they talk and move . \\nwhy is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi , he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth , coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll ? \\nwhy , for every fluid physical gesture , do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions ? \\nmore to the point , who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring \" hyperreal \" ( their term , not mine ) humanoids was a good idea ? \\n \" final fantasy \" is based on a phenomenally popular video game i\\'ve never played , with a story straight out of japanese anime , which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed . \\nif you\\'re a fan of either , please spare me your letters , as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials . \\nwith an expression-challenged cast , \" final fantasy \" mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit . \\nthe result is ugly , confusing and boring . \\nnote : the following reveals the basic plot . \\nif you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it . \\nearth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls . \\nmost of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities . \\nwhile the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach . \\nthey operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) \" that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained . \\naki and dr . sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force . \\nthe waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion . \\nthey have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave . \\nthey are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out . \" \\nare you still with me ? \\nthere\\'s only a little more . \\naki is infected with the alien force . \\ndr . sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her , but the defense wall won\\'t hold much longer . \\nalready , the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams . \\naiding aki and dr . sid are the deep eyes , a group of hard-as-nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in \" aliens . \" \\ncapt . gray edwards ( alec baldwin ) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy ( buscemi ) , a tough woman ( peri gilpin ) and a gentle giant ( ving rhames ) . \\nthrowing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass : in this case general hein ( james woods ) , who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age , even if it destroys earth as well . \\nso there you have it . \\nlike most of the anime i\\'ve seen , the plot combines apocalyptic settings , lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality , all wrapped up in a save-the-earth bow . \\nbut i\\'m bored with apocalyptic settings . \\ni understand why so many live-action films employ them ? they\\'re cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ? \\nthe action scenes and shoot-em-ups don\\'t satisfy either . \\nthe humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can\\'t bring them to life ( in fact , their efforts merely emphasize what we\\'re missing ) . \\naki is especially disappointing ; with her lack of expression and flat delivery , she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena , the eloi girl from 1960\\'s \" the time machine . \" \\ndrab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell-o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces . \\nstudents of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind \" final fantasy : the spirits within , \" but i found it sub-par across the board . \\n \" futurama \" does more effective battle visuals , the kids in \" south park \" are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of \" the outer limits \" does better doom and gloom sci-fi . \\nso who needs this ? \\nnot me . \\n',\n"," b\"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films . \\ni'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years . \\ni'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film . \\nby that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance . \\nall doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience . \\nit seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts . \\nit took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in . \\ni guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain . \\nanyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond . \\ni think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films . \\nthere were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined . \\nand bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series . \\nthe world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series . \\neverything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 . \\nfor the most part , the action sequences worked very well . \\nalthough , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film . \\ni think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted . \\nwhile he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film . \\nmost noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie . \\nhe almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing . \\nbut they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing . \\nif you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit . \\nthe world is not enough is no exception . \\nthis time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world . \\n007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain . \\nwhy this point is included is beyond me . \\nthey took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought . \\nanyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline . \\ni guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore . \\nbond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims . \\nalong the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) . \\nlike all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words . \\nmy biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films . \\nthere was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing . \\nthe buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character . \\nit was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film . \\nlater , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something . \\nbut because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly . \\nafter all , it isn't shakespeare . \\nhow about the cast ? \\nbrosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 . \\ni grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character . \\njudi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role . \\nshe brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner . \\nrobbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie . \\ncoltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes . \\nthen there are the bond girls . \\nsophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today . \\nthere is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim . \\nthose that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face . \\nmarceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest . \\nthen we have denise richards . \\nthere was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks . \\nand after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes . \\ni was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist . \\nadmittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely . \\ni must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character . \\nwhile carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me . \\nthe producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground . \\ni guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character . \\nthis might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations . \\nlast , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever . \\nalthough his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch . \\nrumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role . \\nhe says future appearances are up to a higher power . \\nthe producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese . \\nwhile we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands . \\nso how does it stack up ? \\ndespite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie . \\nand , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies . \\nthis is easily the best of the brosnan films . \\nit may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 . \\none thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series . \\nhere's looking forward to bond number 20 . \\n\",\n"," b\"`the bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see . \\nwading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic . \\nthose hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy . \\nawaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money . \\nalthough he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor . \\nmost will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile . \\ncan o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ? \\nperhaps , if he found the proper vehicle . . . \\nbut `the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements . \\nthe actor just can't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success . \\na few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor' . \\no'donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger ) . \\njimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage . \\nthe problem is that his proposal sucks . \\nbig time . \\nyou can tell things aren't going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer-in-the-headlights' look when anne questions his approach . \\nand then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens . \\njimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative ) . \\neverybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie . \\nof course , there's a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years . \\nthe bad news is that jimmie's birthday is the following day . \\nwith anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with . . . \\nand within a very limited time frame . \\nthere are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor' . \\nfor one , the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ? . \\nanother is the colorful cast . \\no'donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it's own mediocrity . \\nustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie's marital adventures . \\nand now the cons : the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old-fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel . \\nthe characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable . \\nyes , `the bachelor' is far more frustrating than cute . \\nthe screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived . \\nthe considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained . \\npotential goes out the window early to suit sinyor's `colorful' approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director's wishes . \\n`the bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it . \\nyou've seen the tv spots , haven't you ? \\no'donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from ? ' \\nin actuality , he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it's one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) . \\nafter seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else . \\no'donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured `the bachelor' , and are hunting him down for revenge . \\n\",\n"," b'it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of \" the horse whisperer , \" the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to \" projection difficulties . \" \\nrobert redford\\'s film version of nicholas evans\\' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with \" titanic , \" but is only now making its much anticipated debut . \\nthis ( strategic ? ) \\ndelay has allowed \" the horse whisperer \" to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office . \\nno matter . \\nredford\\'s film stands head and shoulders above james cameron\\'s ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments . \\nwhatever the reasons for its postponement , \" the horse whisperer \" supports the old adage \" better late than never . \" \\nredford has taken evans\\' book and given it the big screen treatment . \\nwhile parts of \" the horse whisperer \" are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial \" travelogue \" that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast . \\nwhen her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace\\'s beloved horse , pilgrim . \\nrefusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too . \\nundeterred by tom\\'s initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal . \\nredford\\'s film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds . \\nthe film\\'s a little long and , even if you haven\\'t read the book , it\\'s pretty obvious where it\\'s heading--but these are minor complaints . \\nredford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it\\'s scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role . \\ndianne wiest , chris cooper ( \" lone star \" ) , and sam neill--better than i\\'ve seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast . \\nand the director\\'s respect for horses is clearly in evidence . \\none word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing . \\nredford\\'s canvas is huge and exquisite . \\nhe doesn\\'t hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson\\'s viewfinder . \\nveteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since \" the horse whisperer \" is \" dances with wolves \" by way of \" out of africa \" ( oscar winners both for barry ) . \\nfortunately , barry\\'s replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance . \\n \" the horse whisperer \" is that rare kind of movie : it looks good , it feels good , and by golly it does you good . \\nthe wait , it turns out , was well worth it . \\n',\n"," b'ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking . \\nthese films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous . \\nif it\\'s not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect . \\nhackers is guilty of all of these crimes . \\nto anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can\\'t take it anymore . \\nthose of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled \" goofs \" . \\nthis is the section for mistakes in the movies . \\nwell , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : \" generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology \" . \\nand truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct . \\nthe plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking . \\nmore specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller . \\nmiller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers . \\nthe film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems . \\nhe was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old . \\nthe film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer . \\ndade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi . \\noh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film . \\nreally , i can\\'t think of much more to say about the film\\'s plot aside from what i\\'ve said . \\nit\\'s just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi . \\nthanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do . \\nthis movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list . \\nto sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film . \\nif you\\'re looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers . \\nalthough at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users . \\nhopefully , this film didn\\'t influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time . \\n',\n"," ...]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":254}]}]}

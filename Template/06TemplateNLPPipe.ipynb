anything this bad in the next ten years . \\\\nbased on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information . \\\\nit\\\\'s the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes . \\\\nok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind . \\\\nwhen were we conquered ? \\\\nthe audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we\\\\'re going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . . \\\\nkeep reading ) . \\\\nalso , why don\\\\'t we get to see earth get conquered ? \\\\nhow the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? \\\\nhumans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film\\\\'s first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado . \\\\nthey grunt and groan and babble about monsters . \\\\nso , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? \\\\nnone of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . \\\\nthis is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film . \\\\none of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it . \\\\nthe \\\" monster \\\" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . \\\\nhe turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them . \\\\nso , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? \\\\nanyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit . \\\\nthe cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something . \\\\nso these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? \\\\nand , we\\\\'re supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can\\\\'t even handle a few cavemen ? \\\\none of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . \\\\nso jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? \\\\nplease , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood . \\\\nwhy did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? \\\\nshouldn\\\\'t they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? \\\\nthe psychlos refer to humans as \\\" man animals \\\" but yet dogs are still \\\" dogs \\\" . \\\\nwhy aren\\\\'t they \\\" dog animals \\\" ? \\\\nthe psychlos are after mining earth\\\\'s precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? \\\\nwhy do i even care at this point ? \\\\ni\\\\'m a fan of travolta\\\\'s and i\\\\'m glad to see he\\\\'s back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) . \\\\nbut how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? \\\\nand how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? \\\\nhe\\\\'s more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn\\\\'t hold back my laughter . \\\\nnow despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta . \\\\nall of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee . \\\\nalso , travolta\\\\'s acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world . \\\\nooooo , scary villain . \\\\nas a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better . \\\\nyou can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth . \\\\ni did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . . \\\\ni cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . . \\\\nand still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids . \\\\nby the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film . \\\\nfolks , save your cash . . \\\\ndon\\\\'t go see it , don\\\\'t rent it , and don\\\\'t buy it . \\\\nyou\\\\'d be more entertained by taking the money you\\\\'d use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . . \\\\nwe\\\\'ll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) . \\\\nunless of course you\\\\'re just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you\\\\'ll come away with from this movie . \\\\nthat , and a headache . \\\\n[editor\\\\'s note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology . \\\\ni\\\\'m not sure why . . . \\\\nsomething just made me feel compelled make the choice . ] \\\\n'\",\n          \"b'usually when a blockbuster comes out , it\\\\'s loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \\\\nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \\\\nthe film is based upon the comic book series \\\" the flaming carrot \\\" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \\\\nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \\\\nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \\\\nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \\\\nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \\\\n \\\" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \\\" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \\\" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \\\\nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \\\\nthat is until they aquire \\\" invisible boy \\\" ( kel mitchell ) , and \\\" the bowler \\\" ( janeane garafalo ) and \\\" mr . splein \\\" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \\\\nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \\\\nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \\\\nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \\\\nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \\\\na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \\\\nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \\\\nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \\\\none was paul reuben . \\\\nno matter how disgusting or revolting \\\" mr . splein \\\" may be , you still can\\\\'t help but laugh . \\\\nit\\\\' so incredibly moronic , it\\\\'s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \\\\njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \\\\nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \\\\nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \\\\non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \\\\nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \\\\ntheir parts were so limited , they\\\\'d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \\\\nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \\\\nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \\\\nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \\\\nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i\\\\'m glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \\\\nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \\\\nit forgets about money making , because it\\\\'s not likely to make a bundle like it\\\\'s proceeders , and that\\\\'s what works . \\\\nstupid ? \\\\nmaybe , but for once i\\\\'m not disappointed . \\\\nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \\\\n'\",\n          \"b'if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don\\\\'t look particularly good because i\\\\'m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . \\\\nif that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : \\\" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don\\\\'t have to . \\\" \\\\nbut i know that\\\\'s bunk-you\\\\'re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . \\\\nso i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . \\\\nyou know the feeling , when you\\\\'re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . \\\\nsometimes i think that\\\\'s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . \\\\nadmit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . \\\\nso do i . \\\\nso i saw \\\" supernova . \\\" \\\\ntruth be told , \\\" supernova \\\" wasn\\\\'t quite as bad as i thought it might be . \\\\nmaybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn\\\\'t started tinkering with the director\\\\'s ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . \\\\nmaybe i\\\\'m becoming a softy . \\\\nin any case , i didn\\\\'t find \\\" supernova \\\" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . \\\\nbut it\\\\'s still bad . \\\\nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel \\\" nightingale . \\\" \\\\nthe crew includes captain a . j . \\\\nmarley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . \\\\nthere are some attempts at \\\" characterization , \\\" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . \\\\ndon\\\\'t expect any more explanation , because you won\\\\'t get it . \\\\nanyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . \\\\nduring the dimension jump ( i think that\\\\'s what it\\\\'s called , but don\\\\'t hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . \\\\nhe calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . \\\\nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . \\\\nhave you seen \\\" alien ? \\\" \\\\nhave you seen \\\" event horizon \\\" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \\\\ngood . \\\\nthen you\\\\'ve seen \\\" supernova . \\\" \\\\npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \\\\nafter all , no one\\\\'s going to think for a second that troy won\\\\'t turn out to be a villain . \\\\nbut the bigger problem with \\\" supernova \\\" is that it can\\\\' t just stick to the simple plot it\\\\'s afforded . \\\\nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it\\\\'s a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \\\\nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \\\\ndid the ship\\\\'s computer learn something about humanity ? \\\\nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \\\\nand just what does the film\\\\'s title signify , if anything ? \\\\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn\\\\'t developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\\\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\\\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\\\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\\\nbassett and spader\\\\'s characters start off hating each other . \\\\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they\\\\'re engaging in some hanky-panky . \\\\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\\\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\\\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\\\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\\\nmaybe that\\\\'s why the film\\\\'s title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\\\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you\\\\'re seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\\\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\\\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\\\ndoesn\\\\'t make sense . \\\\nsince i didn\\\\'t understand anything about these characters\\\\' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\\\nnot a whit . \\\\nit\\\\'s a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\\\nthey don\\\\'t find it . \\\\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\\\nsexual tension ? \\\\nmore like constipation . \\\\nmaybe they\\\\'re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \\\" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \\\" \\\\nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\\\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film\\\\'s biggest forehead-slapper . \\\\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\\\nhe\\\\' s awfully one-note , but it\\\\'s not as if he\\\\'s given any more notes to work with . \\\\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\\\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\\\nphillips broods . \\\\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\\\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn\\\\'t paying much attention by then . \\\\n \\\" supernova \\\" is pretty awful , but i\\\\'m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\\\nthat\\\\'s it . \\\\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you\\\\'ll probably hate it more than i will . \\\\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven\\\\' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn\\\\'t going to save the film . \\\\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \\\\nit usually results in a bad movie , and that\\\\'s what \\\" supernova \\\" is . \\\\n'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":

bad in the next ten years . \\nbased on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information . \\nit's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes . \\nok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind . \\nwhen were we conquered ? \\nthe audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . . \\nkeep reading ) . \\nalso , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ? \\nhow the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? \\nhumans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado . \\nthey grunt and groan and babble about monsters . \\nso , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? \\nnone of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . \\nthis is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film . \\none of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it . \\nthe \\\" monster \\\" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . \\nhe turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them . \\nso , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? \\nanyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit . \\nthe cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something . \\nso these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? \\nand , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ? \\none of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . \\nso jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? \\nplease , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood . \\nwhy did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? \\nshouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? \\nthe psychlos refer to humans as \\\" man animals \\\" but yet dogs are still \\\" dogs \\\" . \\nwhy aren't they \\\" dog animals \\\" ? \\nthe psychlos are after mining earth's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? \\nwhy do i even care at this point ? \\ni'm a fan of travolta's and i'm glad to see he's back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) . \\nbut how did he possibly think this was a good movie ? \\nand how did he think he was giving a good performance here ? \\nhe's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn't hold back my laughter . \\nnow despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta . \\nall of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee . \\nalso , travolta's acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world . \\nooooo , scary villain . \\nas a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better . \\nyou can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth . \\ni did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . . \\ni cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . . \\nand still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids . \\nby the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film . \\nfolks , save your cash . . \\ndon't go see it , don't rent it , and don't buy it . \\nyou'd be more entertained by taking the money you'd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . . \\nwe'll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) . \\nunless of course you're just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you'll come away with from this movie . \\nthat , and a headache . \\n[editor's note : for some reason though , the day after my screening i converted to scientology . \\ni'm not sure why . . . \\nsomething just made me feel compelled make the choice . ] \\n\",\n          \"usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \\nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \\nthe film is based upon the comic book series \\\" the flaming carrot \\\" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \\nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \\nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \\nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \\nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \\n \\\" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \\\" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \\\" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \\nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \\nthat is until they aquire \\\" invisible boy \\\" ( kel mitchell ) , and \\\" the bowler \\\" ( janeane garafalo ) and \\\" mr . splein \\\" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \\nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \\nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \\nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \\nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \\na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \\nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \\nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \\none was paul reuben . \\nno matter how disgusting or revolting \\\" mr . splein \\\" may be , you still can't help but laugh . \\nit' so incredibly moronic , it's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \\njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \\nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \\nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \\non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \\nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \\ntheir parts were so limited , they'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \\nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \\nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \\nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \\nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \\nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \\nit forgets about money making , because it's not likely to make a bundle like it's proceeders , and that's what works . \\nstupid ? \\nmaybe , but for once i'm not disappointed . \\nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \\n\",\n          \"if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it . \\nif that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : \\\" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to . \\\" \\nbut i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say . \\nso i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie . \\nyou know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly . \\nsometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever . \\nadmit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies . \\nso do i . \\nso i saw \\\" supernova . \\\" \\ntruth be told , \\\" supernova \\\" wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be . \\nmaybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed . \\nmaybe i'm becoming a softy . \\nin any case , i didn't find \\\" supernova \\\" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe . \\nbut it's still bad . \\nthe film takes place aboard the medical space vessel \\\" nightingale . \\\" \\nthe crew includes captain a . j . \\nmarley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) . \\nthere are some attempts at \\\" characterization , \\\" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) . \\ndon't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it . \\nanyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent . \\nduring the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board . \\nhe calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with . \\nthen a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening . \\nhave you seen \\\" alien ? \\\" \\nhave you seen \\\" event horizon \\\" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ? \\ngood . \\nthen you've seen \\\" supernova . \\\" \\npost-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either . \\nafter all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain . \\nbut the bigger problem with \\\" supernova \\\" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded . \\nnumerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped . \\nwas there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ? \\ndid the ship's computer learn something about humanity ? \\nwhat was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ? \\nand just what does the film's title signify , if anything ? \\nas far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements . \\ncharacter relationships in this film also make very little sense . \\nfor some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex . \\nwe get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes . \\nbassett and spader's characters start off hating each other . \\nfifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky . \\nwhen troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him . \\nevery single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut . \\nthe most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits ! \\nfurthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits . \\nmaybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster . \\nright after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations . \\nthe rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby . \\npoint b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing . \\ndoesn't make sense . \\nsince i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ? \\nnot a whit . \\nit's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do . \\nthey don't find it . \\nbassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces . \\nsexual tension ? \\nmore like constipation . \\nmaybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as \\\" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . \\\" \\nnot that we ever find out who that is , mind you . \\nthe climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper . \\nas troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected . \\nhe' s awfully one-note , but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with . \\nthe rest of the cast does even less . \\ntunney stands around looking cute , then scared . \\nphillips broods . \\ncruz flirts with the computer . \\nthen they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then . \\n \\\" supernova \\\" is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got . \\nthat's it . \\nif you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will . \\neven the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film . \\nhonestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ? \\nit usually results in a bad movie , and that's what \\\" supernova \\\" is . \\n\"\n        ],\n
